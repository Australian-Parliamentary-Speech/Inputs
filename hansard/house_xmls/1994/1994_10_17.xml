          —The report I have just presented is of a bilateral parliamentary delegation to Japan and the Republic of Korea in July of this year. Japan and South Korea are our two largest trading partners in Asia, and we already have extensive ties and excellent relations with both countries. But, in light of significant changes that are taking place, we cannot afford to be complacent or to take the relationships for granted.

          Whilst, on the whole, the changes will present positive opportunities rather than difficulties for Australia, it is vital that we make an effort to understand what is going on so that we can respond in the most productive way. I want to use some of the time available for the consideration of this report to outline the significance of some of these changes, but before doing so, I place on record the delegation's sincere appreciation of the hospitality of our hosts and the assistance provided by the parliamentarians, officials and the other people we met.

          The visits were made in response to generous and much appreciated invitations from the presiding officers of the parliaments of Japan and Korea, and on behalf of the Australian parliament I thank them for their courtesy. I also record our appreciation of the highly professional work of the Australian ambassadors and their staff in Tokyo and Seoul. Both Ashton Calvert in Japan and Mack Williams in South Korea are obviously highly regarded for the work that they do, and they are supported by an excellent complement of foreign affairs officers and trade officials. The success of the delegation was due in no small measure to the efforts of the ambassadors and officers such as Don Dobinson in Japan, and Elizabeth Toohey and Adrian Morrison in South Korea.

Finally, I thank the delegation's secretary, Ian Dundas, for his dedication, total professionalism and assistance to the entire group and to my adviser, Claire Cooney, for her continuing support to Ian and the delegation during the visit.

          I will now make a few brief remarks about the matters that arose during the delegation's visit to both countries. Tomiichi Murayama was appointed Prime Minister of Japan just a few days before the delegation left Australia for Tokyo. In fact, I think we were the first foreigners to see the new Prime Minister after he succeeded to that post. The National Assembly of the Republic of Korea had also just elected a new speaker. Both events created some uncertainty about the delegation program and were indicative of the interesting political dynamics in both countries. The death of Kim Il Sung, the President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—that is, North Korea—just three days before we were to arrive in Seoul also contributed to a sense of uncertainty and change.

          There is currently under way in Japan a process of significant political reform. After considerable delay and debate, the Diet has passed electoral reform legislation and new electoral boundaries are being drawn up. It might have been thought that the Liberal Democratic Party, which was returned to government as a coalition partner with the Socialist Party, might have pushed for an early election based on the old boundaries, but I think it was quite clear that all the parties now support the electoral reform process and are not prepared to go to the people without first bringing in the new system.

          The changes that are being introduced may make it harder for minor parties but will also make it more important for the major parties to concentrate on presenting clearly differentiated policies. The outcome is likely to be a return to political stability and the emergence of something more like a two-party system.

          There was much speculation that Prime Minister Murayama's government would not last long before it went to the polls. With the electoral reforms now nearing finalisation and with the coalition's success in securing passage of a budget it would appear that an election at any time is a real possibility. Prime Minister Murayama has indicated that it is not his intention to call an early election but it remains to be seen whether the current coalition can be held together. The clear view we formed, however, was that there was political will on all sides for this alliance to continue.

          The implications for Australia of these political reforms are difficult to identify. It may be that a period of political stability with less suggestion of corruption will provide future governments with the chance to turn their attention to the dominance of the Japanese civil service. This could result in a civil service that is more responsive to the policies of government of the day, and there may then be implications for Australia in the way trade is administered.

          In this context it is important to note that Prime Minister Murayama and Foreign Minister Kono were both anxious to explain to the delegation that the new coalition was committed to trade reform and the implementation of the Uruguay Round of GATT. Foreign Minister Kono's Liberal Democratic Party may reassert its political dominance and, if so, its rural conservative roots may make it more difficult for it to honour these commitments, but on the whole the signals given to the delegation in relation to trade liberalisation in Japan were very heartening.

          The political situation in South Korea has not recently been as volatile as that in Japan, despite, perhaps, some of what we saw on television last week. Hwang Nak Joo has recently been elected Speaker and there have been some changes in the senior ranks of the government as South Korea grapples with the problem of implementing trade reforms in the face of opposition from a conservative rural lobby. On the whole, the impression is one of a consolidating but relatively new democracy that is still developing the role of its parliament.

          There is some potentially destabilising domestic opposition to trade liberalisation in South Korea. This is not surprising, given that it has been estimated that the Uruguay Round will result in an increase in exports from South Korea worth $US25 billion over 10 years but that the agricultural sector could decline by $US10 billion. These figures mean that the government of South Korea will continue to face some domestic opposition but, on balance, it will need to commit itself to trade reform. This is an area where Australia may need to retain some vigilance and continue to encourage South Korea along the reform path.

          The delegation took the opportunity to stress the importance of the Asia-Pacific region and to emphasise the common interests that Japan, South Korea and Australia share in the region. It is true that we are taking the same approach on many issues. There is an opportunity for Japan and South Korea to be the northern pillars, and for Australia to be the southern pillar, of a joint effort to bring further peace and prosperity to the region. It was in this respect that the delegation also stressed the importance of a continuing commitment to trade reform, particularly the implementation of the Uruguay Round of GATT.

          While in Japan, and then later while in South Korea, I also took the opportunity to raise issues concerned with inter-parliamentary relations, particularly the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum. This is a matter of considerable importance for parliamentarians in our region and I hope to see a positive response to the formation of an Australian group in the near future. In my view, the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum may, in time, assume the same role and importance as the Inter-Parliamentary Union—which, of course, is a global organisation—and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, to which we also belong.

          Finally, I would like to make a brief comment about the role played by parliamentary delegations when visiting other countries and when bringing reports into this parliament. Some criticism has been levelled at parliamentarians about their involvement in parliamentary delegations. During the 10 or so days that we were away—in fact it was a little longer—we visited two countries. The pace at which we were expected to operate—bearing in mind the number of discussions that we held and the seniority of the people whom we met, from the Prime Minister of Japan through to the President of Korea, trade ministers, Speakers, Presidents and so on—in my view indicates the importance with which these delegations are received and also the way in which the knowledge which the delegates obtain as part of those delegations can play an active role in the development of better relations between Australia and other countries.

          The fact that delegations such as these are led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, parliamentary secretaries or other people of some significance in Australia opens up an enormous vista and an enormous opportunity for parliamentarians, particularly when we consider the level of foreign dignitaries with whom we get to meet. These are aspects of parliamentary delegations which should not be lost on those who ultimately make the decision as to how many visits are taken during a year and how many parliamentarians make those visits. I commend the report to the House.

Members of the delegation included the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the member for Paterson (Mr Horne). The secretary to the delegation, Mr Ian Dundas, an officer of the Australian parliament, proved to be extremely competent and a man of considerable stamina, in that he was the first to rise in the morning and the last to retire at night.

         The Australian Government does not recognise the authorities in Taiwan as having the status of a national government so the delegation's visit was unofficial. Nevertheless, the visit was hosted by the government of Taiwan and the Taiwanese Legislative Yuan, and the group was able to meet senior government representatives and parliamentarians. This provided an opportunity to discuss matters of bilateral interest as well as fostering goodwill and enhancing mutual understanding.

          Trade is the focus of Australian-Taiwan relations and it runs at a similar level to our trade with the People's Republic of China. In 1993 Australia's trade with Taiwan amounted to $5.1 billion, only slightly less than our trade with mainland China at $5.2 billion. In 1992 Taiwan was Australia's fourth most important Asian trading partner and our seventh most important overall.

          Taiwan is generally excluded from international multilateral treaty arrangements because of its non-recognised status, but a number of bilateral agreements have been concluded with Australia. These include the establishment of direct air links, a non-government scientific and technical exchange agreement, and memoranda of understanding relating to the promotion of investment and technology transfer and to the protection of industrial property, patents and trade marks. These agreements and the market liberalisation will present opportunities for Australian exporters; but, more than this, there are also opportunities to expand bilateral relations generally. Officials from the Board of Foreign Trade indicated to us an interest in expanding technological transfers, cultural exchanges and tourism.

          I must say that there is a great deal more that Australia could be doing to enhance its relationship with Taiwan, restricted as it may be by our parallel relationship with the People's Republic of China. Despite the lack of formal recognition, Australia enjoys a strong and beneficial relationship with Taiwan. In recent years several agreements on commercial transactions have been negotiated, trade barriers have been reduced, and there has been considerable Australian-Taiwanese cooperation on bodies such as APEC.

          However, the relationship remains dominated by Australia's recognition of the People's Republic of China. The joint communique issued by the government of Australia and the government of the People's Republic of China following formal recognition in 1972 states that the Australian government recognises the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. It also acknowledges the position of the Chinese government: that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China.

          However, the push for Taiwanese participation in the United Nations and the emergence of Taiwanese nationalism may force a re-examination of the issues involved.

          In discussions with the delegation, Dr Fang, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, members of the Legislative Yuan, and Mr Yeh, Deputy Director-General of the Government Information Office, all put a strong case for Taiwan's membership of the United Nations and it was suggested that the government of the People's Republic of China was using weakness in international law to deny the legal existence of Taiwan. However, the Taiwanese recognise the difficulties they face in establishing an equal international standing and are, to their credit, adopting a cautious pragmatic approach. They also ask for Australian support to the extent that this is possible—and we should give that support.

          Public opinion in Taiwan appears to be divided on the question of how strongly and in what way Taiwan should express its international identity. The delegation held discussions with members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, who expressed, openly and frankly, different views on the future direction Taiwan should take. One member suggested that Taiwan should proceed cautiously and that neither immediate reunification nor the establishment of an independent identity was desirable. In this context, the bid for United Nations membership was supported only as a move to ensure that Taiwan was on an equal footing with the People's Republic of China. It was acknowledged, however, that a growing proportion of the population—roughly 40 per cent consistently in the polls—now favour an independent identity.

          Ms Annette Lu, a prominent opposition member and co-chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested that Taiwan had been too cautious but recognised that the aim of an independent and separate United Nations representation was a long-term objective. She argued that the question of seeking independence was based on the false premise that there is only one China and that Taiwan is still part of it. She favours the view that Taiwan is already a separate entity that ought to vigorously pursue normal international relations, including full United Nations membership. In that, she is not alone. We in Australia will have to deal with this growing push in Taiwan for a much more separate, even independent, identity than was previously projected. But in the meantime we are maintaining mutually beneficial relationships.

          —Mr Speaker, could I initially associate myself with your claims as to the professionalism of the parliamentary delegation's advisers, its secretary and also those who helped us within Japan and Korea. Also, I think the delegation's strength was very much cemented by its large number of rural based members. Ironically, for the most urbanised country in the world, we had a significant number of people who had a base in the beef, coal and steel industries. That was, I think, of very central use to the delegation when we were overseas. For my own part, being a representative of an inner western Sydney seat, it was very informative in so far as some of the issues with which we were confronted are not issues we deal with or give consideration to every day of the week. In talking to the Japan Wool Spinners Association or to people who were helping Australia's push for beef sales in Korea, I think Australia's delegation was very much strengthened by people who had knowledge in these areas.

          I also note very briefly, although I did not go to Taiwan, that in actual fact previous Australian delegations had had access to aboriginal people there. In the case of the delegation I was with a few years ago, that was a particularly important point.

          This delegation, in going to Japan and Korea, went to two nations that are central to Australia's trade future—Japan accounting for approximately 22 per cent of our total trade, and Korea, at 4 1/2 per cent, also of increasing importance. As you noted, Mr Speaker, we did go to both countries during periods of fairly dramatic change and, I should say, a degree of tension. In the case of Japan, there was a very important change of government: an alliance of the Liberal Democrats and the Social Democrats. This was very difficult particularly because of their differences in foreign policy, the socialists traditionally being neutralist and very opposed to nuclear rearmament and also very doubtful about the use of US self-defence forces overseas.

          However, they do have some degree of similarity in that they were both very much creatures of the former electoral system and both had a degree of support from small electorates. One of the challenges, as has been noted earlier, is the fact that Japan is becoming increasingly urbanised. The government of Japan has been unrepresentative to some degree because it has not kept up with that change of population. As I said, there is a degree of sense to this coalition in that whilst both parties commit themselves to opening up the economy, if anything, they would be amongst the more doubtful partners. To that degree there is some kind of rationality to the coalition, despite the other problems.

          We went to Korea at a time of momentous international tension—the reality of North Korea's non-adherence to the international atomic energy commitments that it has undertaken and the fact that it can now, with Rodong missiles, send nuclear arms into Japan, parts of China and the Soviet Union. When you consider that we arrived at a time when, internationally, the regime was regarded as a rogue regime, that it had minimal contact with other countries, that it had a degree of Chinese influence—but not all that sustained—that it refused to really come clean on plutonium use and its ability to attack Japan and, on top of that, had the reality of a change of regime with the death of Kim Il Sung, you realise that it was a period of great interest.

          One thing that surprised me, when I reflected on what we are hearing in Australia and internationally, was the degree of confidence even then that President Kim Young Sam and foreign minister Han Sung Joo had about the future. We had reason to be concerned about the change of leadership, but they, to my mind, were fairly confident that the initiatives by Carter and Kim Il Sung opened the way for his son to basically continue down that road whereas, if there had not been those first moves, his repudiation of North Korea's former isolationist policy would have been far more difficult. It was quite interesting to find that the South Korean leadership was more—I do not want to put too fine a word on it—blase about the future than the rest of the world. Events, at this stage at least, seem to have borne them out. There has been further progress in negotiations since Carter made that initial breakthrough.

          Whilst both countries might talk about reunification, South Korea is mindful of the reality that in 1990 and 1991 the North Korean economy retracted by 3 1/2 per cent and by over five per cent respectively. South Koreans have six times the per capita income of the North Koreans and a gross national product about 11 to 12 times greater. Behind the scenes, despite the emphasis on possible rapprochement and reunification, South Korea is very mindful of the burden that South Korean taxpayers might have to bear in that situation. Therefore, in recent years, it has put forward a `commonwealth' stage of development and it is a lot steadier in that process.

          The situation there is that the chaebols continue to have very strong dominance in the economy. The 30 largest of these conglomerates still generate 50 per cent of the gross national product and 60 per cent of the country's exports. The political importance of that was shown in the last presidential elections, when a fallout with one of the leading chaebols led to a minority candidature and moves by the government to break their authority. A very important comment about South Korea's future was made by John Chung Hwa Oh in the

          South Korea and Australia have a great degree of similarity in attitudes towards APEC and the future trade in the region. I was very interested in South Korea's advance towards democracy. Whilst a total two-party system has not evolved, there is no doubt that the strength of the parliamentary system is growing. One matter of concern, on a personal note, is the country's continued rules against independent trade unions. Essentially, South Korea still says that there is one government influenced or government connected trade union movement. That was made evident while we were there by a very long lockout at Hyundai, which was solved only after we returned to Australia.

          I turn to a matter of a localised nature. In recent years people have been complaining that Australia is putting too much emphasis on Asian languages. The Speaker alluded to the contributions made by our staff in Japan and Korea. It was noticeable that the staff in Tokyo were a lot more on top of local politics, local events and local information because they were a lot stronger in the Japanese language. Although the changeover in staff in Seoul may have had an impact, the staff there were a lot more dependent on government based information and connections with the government than on independent newspapers and other information. That is something that really does drive home that this region is where it is at for Australia and that the thrust in this area must be towards making sure that, not only in relation to the diplomatic corps but also in general, we improve our uptake of Asian languages.

In contrast, in South Korea we were given some indications of what we are up against in regard to the United States' bilateral pressure on South Korea to get preferential access to its markets in front of us.

I also support the comments made by my colleague the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) about our visit to Taiwan. That too was a very valuable visit. Some of the comments of the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) reinforced the value of this visit. We cannot overstate the value of these visits—to Australia, to this parliament and to the members who have the opportunity to make these visits—in achieving a lot in Australia's interests. Our presence in these countries and the fact that we were given opportunities to meet with people at very high levels, such as the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of South Korea, indicate not only that these delegations are very valuable but also that Australia has a very good standing in these areas.

          In the short time I have in which to speak, I would like to concentrate on a few trade issues. I was fortunate enough to listen to the President of the National Farmers Federation speak in my electorate about 10 days ago. He made two very powerful points. He said that our $5 billion worth of food exports to Asia could be increased to a staggering $70 billion within two decades if we were to work a bit harder. That gives us some idea of the perspective that we are talking about when we look at these trade issues, particularly as they relate to agriculture.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The other point that he made was that probably for the first time in our history we are in the right part of the world. I do not think we want to underestimate the significance of that either because we really do have some great opportunities. I believe that through delegations like this we are making a very real contribution to getting hold of some of those opportunities.

        <para first-indent="16">

          Just to reinforce the trade issues, let me say that the fact that the new Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Murayama—who had been in office for less than a week—and the foreign minister were prepared to meet showed that they were serious about talking to us. I took great heart from that meeting because the Prime Minister willingly agreed that his government, the new government of Japan, would honour the undertakings that Japan had given to GATT. As we all know, in some areas, particularly in some of the agricultural areas, Japan has had some very high levels of protection. So to see that agreement honoured, despite the change of government, shows that there is a real commitment on all sides of the parliament of Japan.

          The other thing that I noticed about Japan, and which could have some significance in the way it trades in the next few years, is the dramatic rise in the value of the yen against other currencies, particularly the US dollar and, similarly, the Australian dollar. The full impact of that probably has not been felt yet, because coupling that with the fact that Japan has been in recession and has had zero growth for at least a year means that Japan will have to go through a certain amount of restructuring before it gets back onto the sorts of levels of growth to which we have been accustomed. But notwithstanding that, one of the points that did come through very strongly was that the very high level of domestic savings in Japan has meant that the Japanese have been able to weather this recession far easier than they might have otherwise.

          The point that was made about the growth in some of our agricultural products is quite dramatic. In particular, the work that the Australian Meat and Live stock Corporation has done in Japan is quite impressive. As the report alludes to, we have seen an increase in our exports of beef to Japan from 136,000 tonnes in 1988 to 280,000 tonnes by 1993—a doubling in five years. But what is also very impressive about these figures is that the share of Japanese imports of beef has also risen. In other words, not only have we seen a dramatic increase in the quantity but we have maintained more than half the market, going from 51.7 per cent of the market share of imports in 1988 to 54.2 per cent. That speaks volumes for the work that is being done by Australian exporters. It is one of those stories of which we ought to be proud. It ought to get more recognition because too often we allow ourselves to get bogged down with the bad news and not look at some of the good news. So, as pointed out, the work that has been done here has been very good.

          I would also endorse the comments of the honourable member for Reid about the importance of Australians learning Asian languages. I am very heartened to see what is happening in the schools throughout Australia where this is happening more and more and even exchanges are occurring. A number of schools in my electorate are now arranging for exchanges not only with the three countries we are mentioning today but with other countries throughout South-East Asia and, to be quite honest, we cannot do enough of it. One can already see the value when one sees people dealing with countries whether it be on a political level, a trade level or business level. The value of being able to speak the local language is just amazing.

          I come back now to some of the trade questions. As was mentioned, we also spoke with the Japanese Wool Spinners Association and the Japanese Wool Importers Association in Osaka and I was very heartened to hear the confidence with which those associations spoke about the wool trade. While we saw our wool exports to Japan fall to $448 million in 1993—well down from what it used to be—quite a lot of optimism was expressed that they would rise and that we would see probably a 15 per cent increase in the volume of wool being imported by Japan. Given that the price of wool has been rising in the last 12 months, obviously the value of those exports to Japan will significantly increase as well.

          Another very significant point about the wool industry is the fact that the offshore early stage processing of wool that is going to Japan has now increased from 64 to 78 per cent. While much of that is being moved into other neighbouring countries throughout Asia, it also reflects the opportunities that are being taken up in Australia by a number of early stage processors. I hope that we continue to see those opportunities being capitalised on locally—and I believe they are in many cases. It means that not only will the Japanese be looking to do more of this; as we found in our meetings in Korea, there is a similar move there towards offshore early stage processing, much of it being done through the People's Republic of China.

As I said in my opening remarks, the President of the National Farmers Federation said that we are in the right part of the world for the first time in our history and I think that extends to some of these political decisions.

Much has been achieved by this government to fulfil Australia's capacity as a clever country. Our universities now form a national grid with increased places and resources.

        Libraries are another victim of Australia's complex and overlapping federal system of government. The states have adopted a disparate set of guidelines and commitments for specific purpose grants to municipal libraries. In New South Wales, for instance, the state government provides only 15 per cent of public library funding compared with approximately 40 per cent in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.

        The standards and resources provided to libraries from their local government's own sources of revenue vary substantially across each of Australia's 809 local government authorities. Many councils are still more interested in bitumen highways than the information superhighway. Funding for libraries varies between states and regions from as much as $40 per capita to as little as $5 per capita. Warren Horton, the Director-General of the National Library, summarised the national situation by saying:

Public libraries are the most used cultural facility across the nation, attracting the involvement of four in every 10 Australians.

        Per capita, Australia remains the largest English language book market in the world. Unhappily, especially by international standards, the growth in private sales has not been matched by the public provision of books.

        Those who cannot afford private libraries suffer most from the shortcomings of public libraries. As ever, in the observation of Saul Bellow, `Words are a poor boy's (and girl's) arsenal.' The availability and quality of library services remains a significant gap in Australia's commitment to a just society. The federal government has an equity role to play in closing the gap between municipal responsibilities and municipal finances for libraries, particularly in disadvantaged local government areas. It is never easy to entrench new principles in the administration of government. Invariably it takes a new report or change in technology to kick-start reform.

        First, the government's review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 opens an opportunity for a greater share of municipal grant moneys to be directed to libraries, especially through capital grants. These would allow councils to renew and expand old libraries, fill gaps in existing suburbs and provide services in new suburbs where developer contributions do not apply. With improved and new library buildings, councils would then need to boost recurrent expenditure on libraries from their own sources of revenue. The government will have no better opportunity to set a national standard for the provision of library services and, through these capital grants, to ensure that each municipality in Australia meets that standard.

        Australia has approximately 13,000 libraries: 10,000 in schools, 200 in universities, 1,300 special libraries and 1,400 public municipal libraries. There is no more thorough or better equipped network in Australia, in every suburb and every town, to facilitate public access to electronic information. Already the best libraries no longer restrict their services to collections. Despite limited resources, they are building their technology and their role as access points where clients can use work stations either in the library, at home or even at work to interface with a range of information and learning services.

        Free public libraries were established as a further confirmation of this ideal and through each generation have provided opportunities of equal access to information and learning.

A recent survey by the ABS on cultural venues and activities has shown that at 36.7 per cent libraries have the highest rate of participation for all cultural venues surveyed. The coalition believes that libraries are the lifeblood of any community as they provide equity and information distribution not only for those who wish to be educated but also for those who wish to be informed so as to contribute more to their communities.

       The member for Werriwa seems intent on making a name for himself in relation to the question of federal funding for municipal libraries, and that, of course, is his right. However, he should be extremely cautious about sending out messages that the federal government is sympathetic to his cause. The position of the government quite clearly is that it does not support the member.

        If it is the running cost of municipal libraries that the member is concerned about, he should look at those areas which are of great cost to municipal libraries. For example, Telecom costs are enormous, with the burden falling heavily on most regional libraries. Across-the-board Telecom costs account for five to seven per cent of all libraries' total costs. Even with federal funding, such running costs would remain unchanged. Federal funding is only one option to ease the running costs of libraries and, as the government has told us, it is not a very feasible one. Perhaps the member's time would be better spent looking at the structural problems which libraries have, rather than trying to apply bandaid solutions which, indeed, are always synonymous with the Labor Party.

        Turning to the second part of the member's motion, I personally support in principle developing municipal libraries as access points on the information superhighway. The historic role of libraries in the public library system has been to make the written heritage of our history, culture and technology available to the general public, which has aided the increase of literacy and education during this century. In the next century I expect libraries to continue to play this role in the development and access of information technology.

Indeed, the first part of the motion talks about promoting quality, equity and access to those services, and those are the areas which we must focus on. That is the critical part of it.

        It is quite obvious already that the vast number of library users tend to be in those groups who are particularly in need of assistance—the younger and older members of our society. Access to books and printed material is very important to those groups. For example, for those under 20 years of age, 39 per cent who were reading a book in a most recent survey period had borrowed that book from a library. While that percentage drops to the low and mid-20s for those aged 20 to 50, it then climbs again to 47 per cent for those aged over 65. That is quite a relevant statistic.

Unfortunately, the commercial networks are the source of growth at the moment. I think it is vital that this country assesses the role that the other networks can play.

        The natural answer is that, by increasing the number of tied grants on local government, the federal government can more and more dominate the direction of policy and the way in which local government conducts its affairs. Of course, local government is a very democratic institution. It is the closest government to the people. But the federal government sees that as a threat. The Labor Party does not like local government being independent and self-determined. So it keeps hoisting more and more tied grants on to local governments so they are forced to implement what are basically federal Labor government programs.

        In the paper he prepared, `Federal responsibilities for libraries', the member for Werriwa mentioned the success of the local capital works program. I have got news for you. In my area, we did not get a cent out of that 1992-93 capital works program, and we had a very high level of unemployment. I suppose it was because we were not a marginal seat—a Labor seat—that we did not get any, whereas all the other marginal seats in Western Australia got heaps. The electorate of Canning, the electorate of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), got about $5 million—and it had fewer unemployed people than in my area.

        The term `disadvantaged areas' was mentioned. Presumably that means people who live in marginal Labor seats. If this sort of program is going to be used, what will happen is that the government will use it to implement basic Labor Party policy to help it get re-elected at the next federal election. That is what it did with the local capital works program. It was straight out pork-barrelling by the federal Labor government. As the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) has indicated, so was the `whiteboard program' of the former minister.

       At the outset I want to say that I am not pointing the finger, or the bone, at any organisations, individuals or groups. I want to say that just as the environmental groups have the right to protest legally, so have the timber workers, the forest workers and the loggers the right to work and to work in safety. But what we have seen over the last decade or so is a tremendous growth in the criminal damage to logging equipment, and it is on the rise. Jobs are at risk. Insurance premiums are going up. In fact, some insurance companies are refusing to give risk insurance to logging companies.

       Quite frankly, I think it is absolutely outrageous. Ecoterrorism really started in Australia when John Chester and Mick Habjoern blew up the woodchip terminal at Bunbury in 1976. This activity has continued, even though most Australians are not aware of the dimensions of what is going on. There appears to be a pattern becoming apparent. The same activity is going on in different states all over Australia. A group of publications is around. There is one entitled

        The impact is not only on machinery. Machines can be repaired but the fear and the stress being suffered by the timber workers in the sawmills and the forests are very difficult to handle.

        Spiking trees is a criminal act. It creates great danger. Unfortunately, this is booming in Tasmania. On Monday, 21 March this year, an anonymous press release announced that a large-scale tree spiking campaign was under way in Tasmania's southern forests. A large number of trees have been spiked in the southern forests. That is in the Picton-Huon area of Tasmania, about 40 minutes drive south of Hobart. In the last three months, there have been at least a dozen incidents where spikes have been included in logs. They are put in about two metres above the ground; the trees are felled below that height; and the logs then go through circular saws—each saw blade has about 50 teeth—turning at 200 kilometres an hour. When the saw blade hits the spike in the log, the tips of the teeth shear off. It is like shrapnel or a hand grenade exploding in the workplace. This must stop. It is totally unacceptable in Australia.

We cannot blame sawmill workers for being terrified when groups of terrorists—and this is what they are—groups of criminals, groups of outlaws are deliberately sabotaging sawlogs with spikes, with the ultimate aim of causing death and injury. No matter who is doing this, it is totally unacceptable and outrageous behaviour.

        The police are doing everything they can but it is believed that this is being done by a small group of people who are highly mobile and who have been seen in several states. The modus operandi is the same from state to state. The mainstream conservation groups, I am pleased to say, have distanced themselves from them. This is not just vandalism out in the bush; it is costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is disrupting work and income. There is an enormous potential for injury or death in our sawmills and forests.

        I want to go back to the list of incidents associated with Greensill Brothers timber milling. At Orara West State Forest in 1993 a Caterpillar D16 was started, run down into the bush and left to run out of fuel. A Caterpillar EL24O excavator was broken into, its gauge was dismantled and it was hot-wired to start. It was also left to run itself out of fuel. There was no costly damage except for odd pieces of gauges and the dash. In the Whian Whian state forest a Caterpillar D7F tractor was sabotaged with dirt in the transmission and final drive at an approximate cost of $20,000. The fuel tank, which held 4,000 litres, had the bottom hose slashed and was approximately half full. That cost $1,000.

        This sabotage cannot be allowed to go on. Rational, reasonable debate about logging and the forests is acceptable. Legal protesting is acceptable. Terrorism can never be acceptable in this country. We must as a community, as a nation, reject acts of criminal vandalism that are affecting jobs and families. Above all, we have to reject the life-threatening acts of eco-terrorism.

        This problem became evident as early as the 1980s when Mr Simon Baulderstone, himself an environmentalist, drew attention to the fact that bolts were being used in trees at Mount Nardi to destroy chainsaws.

In Victoria an organisation called Bush Alert has been set up to do just that.

        I am the first of four generations of Snows who has not been involved in the timber industry in the area of the honourable member for Cowper, which is on the north coast of New South Wales. They have had a long record of peaceful logging. The environmentalists have contributed greatly to the logging procedures. They have come up with suggestions for change. These suggestions have been incorporated into the scientific studies which have occurred and, as a result of that, we have much better procedures compared with the clear-felling of years gone by. We need to have tension between environmentalists and the industry, but not this sort of tension where violent strategies are used to try to deal with problems. This gives a bad name to all of those involved with the forestry industry, but particularly to the environmentalists themselves, who want to see a sustainable industry. We are all agreed on that and we all ought to be working on that.

       To a large extent, the case in support of my motion is self-evident. Some of the main reasons are outlined in the text of the motion. The first question we might ask is: why has the ruling clique of the NRMA chosen to pursue this objective? We have heard high sounding phrases like `unlocking the wealth of the NRMA', `sharing the future with the members' and `issuing free shares'. All of these alleged reasons are spurious. We have to look for the benefit to those who have promoted this proposal and who mouth these high sounding phrases.

        The benefits to the ruling clique are, firstly, it will consolidate and entrench its control over the NRMA and the wealth of the NRMA and, secondly, it will destroy the control of the 1.8 million members, because the corporate structure will enable the owners of blocks of shares—especially large institutional investors—to control the membership of the board. Some board members have been taken for mugs in the promises they have been made to solicit their support for this proposal. They will disappear from any future corporation board faster than they can say h-e-l-p. The issue of control is the real reason a large block of shares will be offered to institutional investors in the proposed float.

        That prospectus, so-called, is one of the most dishonest, deceitful and misleading public information documents that has ever been issued. I do not have time to detail the appalling misrepresentations, understatements and distortions which that document contains. Two directors of the NRMA, Richard Talbot and Dawn Fraser, at their own expense initiated an action in the Federal Court to halt the float. The case was heard before Justice Gummow. Justice Gummow accepted the claim that the shares were not free. He found that the prospectus was likely to mislead and deceive. The expression `free shares' appears at least 160 times in that 100-page prospectus. The claim about free shares is the joke of the century. They would cost members dearly. The meeting proposed for this week has had to be adjourned and the votes received so far are invalid.

        If the float proceeded, benefits to members would disappear. First, the subsidised road service would go.

        Second, rebates on insurance premiums would disappear. They have been equal to about $90 million a year for the past few years.

The other insurance companies have been rubbing their hands in anticipation of the insurance premiums of a corporatised NRMA being increased.

        —This motion refers to the manner in which this House sees the NRMA. It is obvious that my colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) sees the NRMA as a very successful organisation with huge funds to distribute in some social engineering scheme at the whim of three ratbag directors—nothing more than that! These people have had crazy ideas to use the funds of New South Wales motorists to buy airlines, to throw money around. Any bright idea that flashes into their head they believe should be executed by the NRMA using the funds of the motorists of New South Wales—an organisation which has been professionally run and managed, accumulating $2.2 billion and huge assets because of good management over a long period of successful years. Now we have members of the socialist ratbag Left—Geoff Lawson, thank goodness, a great Australian cricketer, had the sense to bail out of this proposal—wanting to fritter these carefully gained funds all over the countryside for any scheme that flashes into their heads.

He states that, first, the strength in the NSW market may diminish if other organisations can expand and the NRMA is not allowed to expand to its capacity.

It is a mutual company and, of course, only about five per cent of members vote at any election—and the honourable member nods in assent. This makes the process of voting subject to any political whim. If you get notables up, rather than competents, you tend to get the public voting for notables rather than competents. There is that risk there. It has not happened. The board is well managed. It comprises sensible people. We have only three who appear to have these strange ideas.

It is unthinkable that an organisation such as the NRMA would be run by any other than top class managers and professional directors. I believe that the Stock Exchange listing would have provided for that. In order to have continued professionalism, the dissident directors should be locked out. They should not be members of the board. For their own sake and for the sake of Australia, they should get out of the way.

The Motorists Action Group, which the member represents in this House, put forward a number of other proposals for spending cash, but the one that I have mentioned, which is the important one, is to buy shares in the failed Southern Cross Airlines.

In effect, what the NRMA has put to its members is this: `For 74 years we have done wonderfully well. We have generated a large amount of money. We now have $6 billion to $10 billion worth of value.' That belongs to the members. There is a question about whether or not it should be unlocked. The word `unlock' has been used over and over again. Should the NRMA unlock the value and release it to the membership? The first question to be asked is: why would one do that? Does one unlock one's value in a house? If one owns a house or has equity in a house, does one sell it and cash it in because one has a value in it? Does having a value in something automatically mean one cashes it in, liquidates it or unlocks it? I have been puzzled by the question of why that would be done all the way through this process.

        I have read the NRMA's prospectus and its subsequent letters and I have watched the public debate. I have not previously spoken on this matter and I have not been involved in any particular public sense in the competing ideas and interests represented on the NRMA board. However, I am unhappy with the idea of unlocking the value of the NRMA. The reason for that is that I do not believe the NRMA can retain either the loyalty or the culture of its membership, its policyholders—the people who pay fees to the NRMA—once it is owned by people in a cash sense.

        The NRMA's great success in insurance was built on its success in road servicing. It was owned by the members and it serviced the members. People who have taken out insurance through NRMA have done so because it is their organisation and they own it—now.

        Taking the figures to date, 84 per cent and 78 per cent, or whatever, 63 per cent—less than two-thirds—of existing members would still own shares. From looking at England and other places which have had privatisation experiences, the shift in that cashing in process will be quite rapid. I have no doubt that, within two years of this demutualisation, fewer than half of the shares in the NRMA will be held by members. Once that happens, it will be just one other insurance company. Whether it will be a national, a multinational or an international company will not really matter. It will be just another insurance company which is owned by shareholders. People can buy shares in an insurance company now if they want to; they can buy shares in a range of organisations now if they want to. Within two years, the culture that was built up and the ownership that was expressed in that membership will have gone.

        —I was wondering why the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was waging this little crusade, and why it had not been taken up by a more senior member of the government. The answer is quite obvious: the government is hugely embarrassed by what has happened. It is embarrassed for two reasons. Firstly, I have a circular memorandum to all government departments which tells the heads of these departments what to do with the money. The government is already banking the money that it is getting from this process. Secondly, this debacle illustrates the gross failure of the government's regulatory regime.

        What is the parliament's business is the gross failure of the government's regulatory regime. One of the most curious features of this has been that the result of the vote was apparently known long before the conclusion of the poll. This is quite bizarre. Not even the New South Wales ALP proceeds on that basis. The vote might be rigged but at least it waits until the vote is over before it is counted. The basic fact is that, for all the extravagant language that the member for Charlton used condemning this and that person, it is the government which deserves to be condemned because its regulatory regime has been exposed as inadequate.

        I note that when the former Chairman of the ASC, Tony Hartnell, left that position it was revealed that he had been receiving $100,000 a year from his former employer, a major city law firm. Now we have the situation of the Deputy Chairman of the ASC, Ms Lynn Ralph, being a director of the NRMA. The fact of the matter is that you cannot have situations where the commissioners of the ASC are also intimately involved with the decision making of major businesses. That is not the NRMA's fault: it is the government's fault for allowing this to go on.

However, if the chair is content for this matter to be spoken of at this time, I would like to speak in support of the 85 per cent of those NRMA members who voted to accept the directors' advice in favour of the demutualisation proposal. The member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) referred to an article quoting my husband, who, I might point out, is a member of the NRMA insurance board, not of the holding company.

        I think the three points made by my husband should be reiterated. Firstly, the NRMA's strength in the New South Wales market is enormous, but unless the NRMA expands out of that market it may undergo atrophy. Listing is the best way to avoid this stagnation. Secondly, other organisations, such as the GIO, pose a strategic threat to the NRMA. It therefore follows that the NRMA must diversify its risks and expand into the new markets of Victoria and Queensland. Thirdly, the technique of listing will enable the NRMA to expand into other states. This whole issue is one of corporate governance. The directors, who have advised on the process, were properly elected by NRMA members and they can be accepted as mature and knowledgeable people who have the best long-term interests of both the members and the NRMA at heart.

        The road services provided by the NRMA act as an entry point to the NRMA's other products. If it were not for road service, NRMA Insurance may as well be XYZ insurance company.

        When you have got a winning formula like the NRMA has you do not change it; you simply refine it and make it better. The NRMA President and Chief Executive have given assurances that road services will not change—except to get better. The proposal will not change the way the NRMA does business, only the form of ownership held by its members. One matter that the House should note is that the prospectus used the word `free' in connection with the shares that members could receive. His Honour rejected this word, but was happy to accept the expression `shares without cost'.

        I can confirm that the NRMA will today seek leave to appeal the decision by Justice Gummow. The boards of the NRMA have committed themselves to the NRMA becoming publicly listed. The judgment did not comment on the merits of the NRMA becoming a listed company, only on some parts of the prospectus. The NRMA management is clearly very disappointed with the outcome of the court proceedings as are, no doubt, many of its members. Research before and after the prospectus was issued demonstrated overwhelming support by the membership for the proposal. This sort of proposal has never been undertaken before. The NRMA sought the best expert advice available in compiling the prospectus.

        The House should remember that 85 per cent of voters have voted to accept the advice of the directors. This is a clear and unassailable majority. If there is to be a new ballot, there is no reason to believe that the result would be different. This attack on the demutualisation proposal is not in the interests of the NRMA membership. The vote shows where the real strength lies and the parliament should keep this firmly in mind.

This is absolute stuff and nonsense. You either say yes or no. Yet 84 per cent have actually said yes. They were not forced to do this. They were not acting on wrong information. We received a very extensive prospectus from the NRMA. I was quite amazed that it took so long to get the papers out to me. When I rang up and asked, `What's happening?'

I have not agreed with everybody who has been elected to the board, and that is the way it should be. How can you call elections to the NRMA boards dishonest? Some 1.8 million people have a right to vote. We have already heard from the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) that a small percentage of NRMA members actually vote. In most organisations that I am in, I have to tell you, exactly the same thing happens. I wish the NRMA success in what it does.

While I should be the last to support Mr Webber in his internal wrangle with the Queensland ALP—he was the Labor candidate who ran against me in last year's general election—it is apparent that Mr Kaiser and his apparatchiks could not lie straight in bed, even with their own members.

        Recently, in Hobart, the ALP made a big thing of its preselection formula for Labor women, yet when it comes to mature aged people and the removal of the compulsory retirement age, I sympathise with the Queensland Pensioners and Superannuants League, which has labelled the ALP's decision as offensive, discriminatory and a case of double standards. It seems to me that the ALP was always thus.

         I have always had an affection for Mr Evans. Unlike many of the people I would classify as opponents at various times and in various places, Mr Evans always had a full and total belief in what he stood up for. Mr Evans will be a dramatic loss to the citizens of Culburra. He will be a dramatic loss to the people of the Culburra Senior Citizens Association. I want the personal sadness I feel to be placed on the record. I wish his wife and family and those who have grown to love him over the years consolation in their loss. I had hoped that I would be able to be at his funeral but that may not be the case. I suggest that Australia has lost a very good and loyal servant.

         This was a matter of considerable concern to many, not least of whom the Aboriginal community in Western Australia, which was concerned about the development being over one of its sacred sites. At the same time, Dr Gallop also has a background in that he was a member of the infamous Legislative Assembly select committee which inquired into the Midland abattoir. It gave a whitewash decision in the Midland abattoir affair and then promptly shredded all its documents so that they were unavailable to anyone else.

         So when people start saying that this is somehow a clean start for the Western Australian state opposition, it is only fair to point out that there are still very strong links between the current leadership and the bad old days of WA Inc. The real fresh start for the ALP will not occur until it cleans out the Augean stables and gets rid of all those people from the past.

Last week, when referring to events in Victoria, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke of a stinking dead cat in the middle of the road. He forgot to mention the stinking dead cat that is in each of the electorate offices of members opposite. The database software that was developed to help you keep your seats was developed by Insight West, a company that has received funds from the filthy lucre of WA Inc. So it has to be borne in mind that whenever the Prime Minister rises to slate one of the state governments around Australia—the economies they have taken over are doing very well—within your own electorate offices there is a stinking dead cat staring at you every time you look at the VDU screens on your computers. It is the software developed by Insight West, a company that was set up using the filthy lucre that came from Western Australia Inc.

         Unfortunately, because of the guidelines which have been applied, some areas of Australia, including some areas of New South Wales—particularly in my electorate, including Merriwa and Scone—are not eligible for assistance because they have not suffered from the drought for a sufficient length of time. But everyone knows that severity due to drought conditions is not dependent upon time. I feel that that decision is somewhat ludicrous and I, along with some of my colleagues, will be making the strongest efforts to ensure that the cabinet extends the provision to assist those requiring urgent assistance.

         —This morning I did launch national mental health week. I was delighted that the opposition spokesperson on this matter attended as well. The launch provided a valuable opportunity for us all to reflect on the very serious issues that surround mental illness, unlike some of the interjections we have had suggesting that this is not an important matter. We all have to play our part in ensuring that people with a mental illness take their rightful place in society. I hope that many people during this week will take part in activities designed to reduce discrimination and improve the treatment of the mentally ill in our community.

         It is clear that we still have a very long way to go. There have been recently some very disturbing, and indeed tragic, reports, for instance in Victoria, of the shooting of people with mental illness. Apparent misunderstanding by the police—one could even say worse than that—has led to a very significant number of people with mental illness actually being shot when, clearly, proper management of their conditions would not result in that outcome.

         As a community we should be outraged, not about what the opposition appears to be concerned about, but about the treatment of the mentally ill in this community. Shooting people who have mental illness is not a solution to the problem. Their rightful place in our society demands they be treated with dignity. I am extremely worried about these reports and I hope members opposite would be, too.

There have been recent reports, in New South Wales in particular, which show that not only people with disabilities but also those with mental illness are significantly short of appropriate housing. State governments have serious responsibilities in both of these areas, which they are clearly not undertaking. This week gives us an opportunity to make sure that they do undertake them.

That is why I am inviting all members of the community—and I thought the opposition would share in this because of the role of its shadow spokesperson in this matter—to have a good, hard look at what the police and our housing authorities do and at what happens at the hospital front door. For instance, in Western Australia recently I have been advised that far too few people, young people in particular, attending accident and emergency services as attempted suicides are not given any psychiatric or psychological counselling; they are simply turned away after medical treatment. That level of hospital management is not satisfactory. Clearly, if turned around, it could improve significantly the mental health of our community and, in this case, young people attempting suicide.

         We all have, I hope, a very strong commitment to this area. National mental health week gives us an opportunity, too, to break down some of those stigmas that people with mental illness face. We are putting some $8 million into a special campaign, not just through the media and magazines but through community organisations and advocacy groups, to help them break down the stigma, ignorance and misinformation that exists in our community. Teachers, lawyers, doctors—everybody—need to look at their behaviour in this area and make sure that they are not adding to the misinformation, the discrimination and the stigmatisation.

He was then written to again by the Civil Aviation Authority and invited to take advantage of the BASI confidential reporting processes in order that he should bring forward his information.

I asked for a report by Sunday—that is, yesterday—in respect of this matter. I have received the reply of the chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, and it is now my intention to recommend to the government that there be a judicial inquiry into these matters.

         Mr Speaker, you and the House will recall that the government aimed at a target of half a million jobs in the course of this term—a figure which, I might say, was scoffed at by the opposition before the last election. We will now achieve that target comfortably on the basis of the growth we have seen to date. We are two-thirds of the way through in just over half the time. The fundamental thing is for governments to have clearly defined and workable policies and to deliver on significant promises. And I think the delivery of jobs, which was a key issue in the last election, is about as significant as it gets.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Behind the figures lie some important messages. One of the most significant of these relates to the recent labour market success of Australian women. There has been no time in Australian history when women have participated more in the labour force. The participation rate is 53.2 per cent, which compares with a rate of less than 40 per cent in the 1960s. Over recent decades, the increase in participation of Australian women has been impressive internationally. Since 1967, for example, we have overtaken France, Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         These achievements are also reflected in employment data. In the last year over 160,000 jobs have been created for women, and 60 per cent of these are full time. While the recovery has also been strong for men, the rate of increase in paid employment for women has been a striking feature of the labour market data.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Women's skills are essential to the future growth of the economy. As you know, Mr Speaker, for a long time now the government has sought to improve the opportunities for participation by women in the work force by growing out the number of child-care places. As a consequence, we promised in the election to meet the demand for work related child care by the year 2001, with an interim target of 300,000 places by 1996-97. We are ahead of our schedule to meet this target, with an extra 38,000 places funded since the election, bringing the total number of child-care places to 242,000. From memory, when the government was first elected to office in 1983, there were 40,000-odd only child-care places in this country. Now it is 242,000 and rising sharply.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The current labour market reflects a very healthy position for Australian women. We have delivered on jobs; we are delivering on the provision of work related child care; and, with the significant measures in the white paper, we will be delivering for the long-term unemployed. Last week I gave the House the figures for those categorised as long-term unemployed. The number of long-term unemployed has now fallen to under 300,000—indeed, to 290,000.

         So, on the principal commitment of jobs, it is there. On the commitment to participation in the work force by women, it is there. On the commitment to back up support of child care, we are ahead of the schedule, as indeed we are on the general commitment of the target of half a million places over three years.

         —I thank the honourable member for Scullin for his question. Members would be aware of the broad shape of the government's retirement income policy. There are two broad legs to it. The first is an efficiently targeted age pension scheme. We have worked over the past decade to ensure that that pension is directed to those in need. The real level of assistance has been improved quite significantly with a 14 per cent real rise. The government has achieved its target of raising pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That was achieved in April 1990, and it has been sustained since.

         The other leg of the government's retirement income policy is to encourage and facilitate the spread of occupational superannuation. A range of measures has been implemented in pursuit of that. The net effect is that we have a retirement incomes structure which is well attuned to the needs of society as we move into the next century with a substantial ageing population.

         What does the opposition say? For all the platitudes in The Things That Matter, there is not even a commitment to maintain indexation of pensions, let alone maintain the target of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings that we have achieved. Similarly with respect to superannuation, it says that it would freeze the superannuation guarantee. In other words, the two key elements of our structure which the World Bank has praised it would seek to undermine.

I was critical of it for that. But some information has recently come to light which may force me to revise that conclusion quite significantly. I am referring to a recent speech by the Leader of the National Party to the Cartwright Hills branch of the Country Women's Association, in the course of which—this one is the mother of all savings options—he is reported to have said:

         —It is important that the Commonwealth, as the nation's largest employer, should have an excellent record in the employment of women at senior levels because of its demonstration to all other employers in the country. It is important also to remember that advancement in the Australian Public Service is on the basis of merit. Holding true to that notion of merit, it is clear that the advancement of women in the Australian Public Service would only ever be on the basis of merit.

         I am pleased to report that there have been some good figures of late on the advancement of women. According to a report on Senior Executive Service figures, the latest statistics for 1992-93 released by the Public Service Commission indicate that the overall representation of women in the SES and the proportion of SES vacancies filled by women have both increased and that the overall representation of women in the SES stood at 15.7 per cent at the end of last year compared with 14.4 per cent a year earlier.

         What is more important is that the proportion of advertised SES vacancies filled by women increased significantly to 27 per cent in 1992-93 compared with 20 per cent in 1991-92. The Commonwealth has established a target for the year 2000—to have 20 per cent of women in senior positions. We will easily exceed that performance indicator because of the following figure alone.

          Women make up over half of the intake of graduate administrative assistants in the APS. This is the key feeder group to future senior executives. In 1982-83, women made up 39 per cent of the graduate intake; in 1987-88, 47 per cent; and in 1992-93, 53 per cent. In addition, the Department of Finance has indicated in a paper on the promotional opportunities for women in the APS that there is very little difference between the career paths of males and females appointed at the graduate administrative assistant level. There is no evidence of systematic bias impeding the movement of women into and above the senior officer level in the APS.

         I am delighted indeed that, as a result of preferred provider models which have been under experiment in Victoria for some time, Medibank Private in Victoria has been able to announce a reduction of 19 per cent in the cost of top cover health insurance. It has done that by negotiating with private hospitals and with doctors in a way that will now be possible for all health funds around the country. It shows what can be done when competition in the private health market is introduced.

         It is significant that the opposition, rather than  introduce competition—which we might have thought was part of its philosophy—has preferred to talk about tax rebates and tax handouts. I notice that the enthusiasm for that has dropped off a little. The shadow spokeswoman for health, addressing a meeting of the private health industry recently, when asked precisely what tax rebates might be given by the opposition if it were ever to get into government, what they would cost and where the funds would come from, simply refused to answer the question and said that the questioner was asking the wrong question. Given the course of the considerable mirth from the audience which ensued, that question still has not been answered. In the face of this example from Medibank Private of a nearly 20 per cent reduction in top cover premiums for the same benefits, I think the opposition should rethink what it passes for a health policy.

Let me explain to this House the means by which the contract was entered into for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

The contract, and every term in that contract, was contained in that legislation, which was adopted by the parliament. The tunnel has been open for a couple of years now. The people who were very happy to open it, the people who have been very happy to marvel at it, are the same people who would never have had the guts or the gumption to build it.

         We gave the New South Wales government $102 million but it misappropriated $51 million of that $102 million and spent it on non-road purposes. So I do not think that we should feel too sympathetic towards the New South Wales government if, as a result of a tax audit seven years later, there is some liability. Quite frankly, if you had gone the way of the then New South Wales opposition, now the government, like so many other projects—such as the pulling down of the Cahill Expressway or the building of the tunnel under eastern Sydney—it would never happen. Seven long years later, we are still waiting for the eastern suburbs tunnel project to proceed. The first project was cancelled—

The second airport will be built by this government 15 years ahead of schedule and the third runway will be opened as soon as the final safety checks are completed in the next couple of weeks. In answer to the honourable member, I think we should leave these matters where they quite properly lie: in the tax relationship between the proponents of the project and the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation. If we had gone down any other path, that tunnel project would certainly never have been built.

         —Mr Speaker, I would like to add to the answer. The implication of the question was that the original tender, in the hands of Transfield, being $600 million, was rising and there was a benefit to Transfield. The chief executive officer of Transfield was not the Treasurer of the Labor Party at the time. Could you imagine a New South Wales Labor government handing out a casino licence to its Treasurer? Could you imagine that? Could you imagine the hue and cry up and down the country if a Labor government handed out a licence to a major casino, saying, `I'll tell you what we'll do here. We'll give it to the Treasurer of our party. What do you think about that? That would be a terrific outcome.' Could you imagine the scream that would come from the other side of the House?

         That cruise vessel is French. It was en route from Guam to Noumea at the time, carrying a crew of around 150 people, including one Australian, but no passengers. The vessel was not hit. There were no injuries. Nobody has claimed or accepted responsibility so far for this incident, but a spokesman for the Papua New Guinea government has said that there is no suggestion that the PNG defence force was involved. The suggestion by some elements of the Bougainville rebels that the vessel which was shot at was an Australian patrol boat, or the one that did the shooting, are both without foundation.

I also knew something of the worth of this company from advice separately received from the chief executive of the company, who wrote to me a couple of weeks before on 8 August, in which he advised that the ANL board, at its meeting of 27 July, had resolved to seek my permission—moi, the Minister for Transport to a further drawdown—

Quite frankly, I am very proud of the role I played in ordering the due diligence, in having this matter tackled, in appointing a new board and in mounting the rescue package.

The suggestion that the Commonwealth is restricting freedom of choice in education is contained in the document The Things That Matter, which claims that this government is seeking to interfere with the responsibilities of the states and non-government school authorities. This suggestion is backed up by implication in the section headed `Our goals for school education'. There the opposition says that it will `encourage greater diversity within the school system', that it will `ensure continued financial support for government and non-government schools', and that it will `support a strong, viable non-government school sector'.

         The inference in that document that this government has neglected non-government schools is a blatant attempt to mislead. From 1966 to 1983—for which the coalition governed for all but three years—enrolments at non-government schools rose from 23 per cent of all enrolments to 24 per cent. From 1984 to 1993, during the period of this government, enrolments have risen from 24 per cent to 28 per cent. I fail to see how that kind of increase—four times the increase allowed by the coalition during its years in office—can possibly justify the accusation that we are restricting choice, particularly when the major funding partner of the non-government schools is the Commonwealth.

         The honourable member for Braddon would be far better employed using his time to address the problems of school education in his home state, where retention rates are 60.6 per cent compared with a national average of 76.6 per cent; that is, Tasmania is 16 per cent behind the national average. It is the worst performing state of Australia by far. But more worrying is the fact that only one in two boys in Tasmanian government schools ever finish their full schooling. In other words, these kids will never have the opportunity to obtain the relevant skills they need to enter the work force. This is a matter of state disgrace and a matter of national concern.

         Anybody doubting the consequence of such low retention rates in Tasmania has only to remember that unemployment in that state is currently 10.9 per cent, well above the national average of 9.5 per cent. The opposition generally, and its shadow minister in particular, would be much better served examining the realities of Australian school education than trying to make creationism compulsory in schools and attacking the independence of church schools. It should also understand that its rhetoric about choice is insubstantial and hypocritical when compared with the reality of this government's achievements in school education.

In the circumstances, I advise the House that, whatever the future might hold, in the 30 years I have been driving I have never been charged with DUI or RBT and the police report relating to the accident in January found that the three people involved in that accident, including me, had no blood alcohol content.

         I say to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), because I think he raises this in the spirit of genuine concern, that there was an episode last week when a particular comment was made by one on my left to the minister when he was answering a question, which subsequently was withdrawn. Many members from both sides of the House remarked to me afterwards that they found it was in the same category. So I again say to you and to all members that you should be careful in the choice of your language. I will give the Minister for Transport the opportunity to speak on indulgence.

        —Following the decision of the High Court last Wednesday, there have been a number of newspaper, radio and television reports. In a significant number of these reports I have been misrepresented. Mr Speaker, rather than enumerate each of these matters, which would unduly delay the House, with your indulgence I wish to make three points of clarification very briefly.

        First, contrary to the reports I did not take this matter to the High Court. The Herald and Weekly Times applied to the High Court for a constitutional ruling on this matter. Secondly, also contrary to reports, the ruling of the High Court did not end the matter of defamation in relation to my case. The High Court has introduced a new set of criteria which are to apply only to members of parliament and public figures. Although this would make it more difficult for MPs to establish defamatory cases, there are major questions as to the interpretation of the new criteria. My case is likely, therefore, to return to the county court, which will need to make such determinations. Thirdly, some reports have asserted that I am opposed to the reform of defamation laws. That is not true. What I have consistently said is that there should be one defamation law for all citizens rather than having strong protection for ordinary citizens and much less protection for public figures, especially where matters of personal integrity are concerned.

        —In question time today the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) a question. In his answer he made statements about some views which were purported to have come from me. I have now received a copy of at least one article from the

        In his answer, the minister said that I believed three things should be compulsory in schools. I think he said they were creationism, Christian values and evolution. I want to correct the record for the parliament. I have not said that. He was referring to, I presume, a comment by a journalist, `Miles is also keen to see Christian values retained in school teaching.' I think that is quite different from saying that Christian values should be compulsory. There are many values which cross a lot of different religious backgrounds, like honesty and care and respect for people and people's property. They are all Christian values. I do not want to enter into a debate on this.

Seeing my opponents and the operation of government gives me a unique opportunity to develop that understanding. The Liberal Party clearly has the interests of the individual at heart. It is not simply devoted to minority groups and blind ideology; it is very much concerned with the future of Australian individuals. The Liberal Party today stands for those forgotten people who are much cited at this 50-year anniversary since Menzies revamped the party and took it into the modern-day Liberal era. Perhaps the groups of forgotten people have changed, but the principle is the same. Among the forgotten people today are the unemployed, the young, the aged and practically the entire Australian community from time to time, except for those select groups which the government seems intent on cultivating.

         The progress of the Liberal Party is a very proud one. From 1909 to 1917, right at the very beginning, they were known as the Liberals. From 1917 to 1939 they were known as the Nationalists. From 1939 to 1944 they were known as the United Australia Party and from 1944 to 1994 we have been known as the modern-day Liberal Party. The Liberal Party in modern Australian history reached its height in 1969 when all governments, federal and state, were Liberal.

         The definition of liberalism or of the Liberal Party and its philosophy seems to elude many, particularly within the press, but for me it is not about being essentially anti-Labor. It is about being the champion of bipartisanship wherever possible and walking down the middle of the road. It is about individualism, not an individualism that is based on selfishness but an individualism which develops all those talents, all those capacities, of individuals without the unnecessary pressure of government and of outside groups.

         If we look at the last 85 years of this party—and certainly the last 50 years, which we have been concentrating on this week—under the 94 years of our Federation, we see that for 54 years we have had Liberal government. In 30 of the last 50 years we have had Liberal governments. The Liberal Party has made a fine contribution along with the National Party in recent decades as strong parties. Labor was out of power for 23 years. Some journalists of that time no doubt were predicting the end of the Labor Party. No doubt at that time those journalists were predicting the demise of Labor in perhaps similar terms as they are now predicting the demise of liberalism.

Any wrong turns or false trails that we may have embarked upon are but passing breezes in the night when compared to the nation that our forebears have built. Labor, sadly, is more about attacking the effort and discipline of individuals, pretending that the government can spend money it has never earned.

         Education is worth mentioning. Menzies was born in Jeparit, western Victoria, and would have had his primary education in very modest circumstances. Being a bright student, I understand, he went to Ballarat high school and then on to university in Melbourne.

        Sadly, that is the media in modern Australia today and the way it presents the parliament to the people. I recall the post-Whitlam era and the devastation and disappointment of Labor people of that era when the Fraser government was at the height of its influence.

         Let us look at what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is saying after that 12 years in government. He has become so obsessed with Canberra that he cannot even consider our major capital cities being anything other than just out there in the provinces. For example, the government held a cabinet meeting in Adelaide last month and, while there, the Prime Minister said this proved that he did not neglect the regions. This is the first time I had ever heard Adelaide being called a region. It will come as a shock to the people of Whyalla, Clare, Streaky Bay and Ceduna. We thought we were the regions and that Adelaide was our major city but apparently even Adelaide is not big enough for our Prime Minister anymore. It begs the question: what does the Prime Minister think of the communities in an electorate such as Grey? Is this Prime Minister even aware anymore that they exist? Is he so unaware, so oblivious to real Australia, that he can see only to the edge of his Kirribilli lawn?

         —In my electorate of Bass, over the last weekend and a few days prior to that, there has been a lot of activity. There has also been a lot of focus on me as the member. I certainly do relish that focus but some of it—in fact, most of it—has been quite negative on the `local incumbent'. This local incumbent came to this government 19 months ago, after the seat of Bass had been held by the opposition for some 18 years. The people of Bass decided that they needed a change—and needed somebody from the Labor side of politics—because people who held that seat before me had been out of touch with the grassroots of Bass.

         Some very exciting things have been happening in Bass in recent times, and I would like to mention a few of them here in the House. Child-care places were desperately needed in Bass and, since coming to this place, I have constantly been approached about getting more child-care places for Bass. I am very pleased to state that, as of today—I am sure that, in part, this is because I have done a lot of negotiation—the north of Tasmania has received 117 desperately needed child-care places, 80 of which have come directly to Launceston. I heard somebody speaking earlier today about child-care places for the children of people in the work force, and that is directly where these 80 places have gone to. Forty places have gone to the University of Tasmania at Launceston to enable persons who are studying to have their children close at hand. The other 40 places have gone to the Pedder Patter Child Care Centre, which is very close to the Launceston General Hospital. This will enable parents—I state very categorically, parents—to have their children nearby, especially during some of the extenuating hours some people in those areas either study or work.

         At this time of year, the local shows are on. The local senator from the opposition side, Senator Watson, has obviously seen the value of what I have been doing at the Launceston show in particular over the last few years—ever since I have been interested in being a member here. He and I had a stand at the Launceston show. He agreed that it is extremely valuable to get to the grassroots people at an open front. A show stand at a show is one way of doing that. People can access you up front; they do not have to wait for appointments and they do not have to slot into your very busy parliamentary schedule.

         I was also chuffed, I suppose, that so many members of the opposite persuasion—the Liberals—came to see my Labor Party show stand. It was obviously a feature at the show. It was a very friendly show stand. In fact, most of the organisation of that show stand was done by my daughter Tamsyn who, I note, is still sitting in the gallery. I am glad she has decided to listen to what is being said here today. The stand was very friendly and very accessible, and the Liberal Party has learnt a lesson from us in that respect. On Friday, I was at another show on Flinders Island. The people of Flinders Island were very warmed to the idea of people from parliament coming and talking to them at the grassroots level. Once again, many opposition members of the state parliament were at that show. People were saying, `It's great to have our parliamentary representatives come down and talk to us without us having to try to get to them in their offices.'

         But, of course, not always wonderful things happen in your electorate. One worrying thing is happening in my electorate at the moment. The state government—which is Liberal—wants to put a road through a world heritage area to connect it and make a round route all around Tasmania. The area it is wanting to put the road into is a very sensitive environmental area. Ray Groom is willing to spend around $3 million on a road that people have often described as `the road to nowhere'. It is not going to be a road easily accessible to anyone who does not have a four-wheel drive vehicle because, during some parts of the year, it is going to be accessible only to people who have four-wheel drive vehicles in their garages. I suggest that moneys for road funding should be looked at in the context of where they are most needed for persons needing travel access.

         I have been looking for road funding assistance for one area of my electorate and, for the last 30-odd years, various other members have been trying to get some road funding for the eastern bypass. At the moment, some heavy vehicles come through one of the very oldest suburbs of Launceston—Newstead. The roads are cracking, and the very beautiful federation and pre-federation buildings and homes along that suburban road are starting to show signs of too much heavy traffic on the roads. Perhaps we should look at where we put the money allocated as road funding.

         I heard road funding mentioned by others here in this House today. In fact, the opposition spokesperson in Tasmania, Michael Aird, said that other road links definitely had far greater priority—and he would know what is happening in Tasmania—and that the link road would be available only for those with four-wheel drives. What is even more ridiculous is that, as I said, access during part of the year would be denied because of the bad weather.

         The Tasmanian government has a responsibility to carry out environmental impact statements, too, when roads are projected to go through areas listed for World Heritage, as this one is. The Premier of Tasmania does not think that it is necessary. In fact, he says, `I have said time and time again that the state government will not support further World Heritage listings.' I suggest that he is well and truly out of touch with the people of Tasmania when he makes those types of statements.

         I would like to mention another event that occurs every year in one of Tasmania's very small communities. Derby is a little town in the north east of Tasmania. It has a population of around 400, and used to be a tin mining community. Derby sleepily rolls on for the majority of the year—in fact, for 364 days of the year—but springs to life one Saturday in October, which happens to be this coming Saturday. On that day, we have what is called the Derby River derby, where any person, persons, groups or teams are able to attack the running waters of the Derby River in whatever craft they feel they can. It is a mild rapid area in some places and decidedly dangerous in other places. On this weekend in October, 3,000 to 5,000 people converge on the tiny town of Derby.

         The Derby River derby is an activity that has now drawn international notice. I was in Derby a couple of weeks ago at a fun night that people put on to entertain themselves, and I was told that the press in Tokyo had contacted people in Derby to find out what the Derby River derby is for, why it happens and what sorts of things go on. The Tokyo press is promoting this tiny activity throughout its tourism ventures for people who come to Australia. Of course, that is putting Tasmania, and in particular northern Tasmania, on the map.

         I brought these things up because what we need in politics is grassroots politics. I was very warmed to hear a member opposite mention that type of politics just a moment ago. We need to get to the people and to be accessible to the people. One of the catchcries of past years has been, `We have our politicians but we can't get to them.' Local shows and local activities are the way to get to the people. We do not have enough time because of our activities here in government; we have to be accessible in another way. I commend shows, such as flower shows, derbies and whatever to honourable members as a way of getting to the people and finding out what real Australia is all about.

         —It gives me no joy to bring to the attention of the House a situation in my electorate that, at best, can be described as a debacle and, at worst, an outrage. It all started on 14 December last year when a constituent from Halls Gap rang me regarding what he described as a financial stand-off between VicTV, now WIN Television, and a government department—a government department which turned out to be the Civil Aviation Authority. Several days after that, I received a letter from the Shire of Stawell addressed to me in the following terms:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This will advise (as you may be aware), that VicTV has for some time, been planning to install a translator to service the township of Halls Gap.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        VicTV has advised Council that although many small communities operate on a self-help basis, with its costing experience with aggregation to date, VicTV has agreed to service Halls Gap at its own cost.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Site evaluations of the area limited VicTV's choice for a site to Mt. William and negotiations have been taking place for some time with the Civil Aviation Authority to share their facilities at Mt. William.
       </para>

        VicTV advised Council recently, that it was horrified to receive information from the Civil Aviation Authority advising of an annual fee of $7,760 plus $250 for an application fee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a comparison, at Yackandandah, VicTV operates an almost identical installation for which the landowner is paid $1,000. At Glenthompson, VicTV is currently paying a fee of $550 per annum.

       <para font-size="-=2">

        You are further advised that VicTV has purchased equipment valued at $30,000 suitable for the area and this has been installed for almost twelve (12) months.

        Without this current problem, VicTV had expected to have Halls Gap VicTV 58 up and running before Christmas and it has therefore requested urgent attention to this matter.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        You are also advised that Council believes the cost structure resulting in such a fee is in part due to the cost passed on from the Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources to the CAA.

        I trust that you will be able to assist Council in this matter.

        I received a letter dated 17 January 1994 from the Executive Director of VicTV in the following terms:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thank you for your letter dated 15th December 1993 relating to the Halls Gap television reception. Realistically, the only site for us to use to improve the quality of television reception is Mt. William, a site occupied by the Civil Aviation Authority. They are happy for us to share facilities, but we were staggered when they advised a rate approaching $8,000 in the first year. Subsequent years would be increased by CPI.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As you are aware, we lease sites throughout the state, and from landowners scattered throughout regional Victoria and we pay an annual fee from $300-$1,000 for sites. When we received advice of the proposed fee, we approached the CAA who flatly refused to vary the fee. The Shire of Stawell have been kept informed and have also made representations but also have had no success.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We consider a fee of $1,000 to be the maximum for such a site, and that would be high when compared to some other comparable sites. A stalemate now exists, and we have equipment ready to roll when we can reach agreement on a reasonable fee.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of the letter from VicTV, I wrote to Mr Rod Oates, the Manager of the Properties Division of the CAA, in the following terms:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have been approached by numerous individual constituents as well as the Shire of Stawell regarding a situation that has developed between the Authority and Television Victoria Limited Ballarat.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I confirm that your officer, Mr. Paul Cooper, is aware of the situation and I also confirm Vic TV has requested the use of the Authority's site and facilities at Mount William to install a translator to service the township of Halls Gap.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Halls Gap township receives extremely poor reception and this can be immediately resolved by translator installation at the Mount William site.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The difficulty appears to be that VicTV believes the annual fee set by the Authority ($7,760) is excessive and is well above amounts being paid for other sites. In this regard, I am advised that other site costs range from $500 to $1,000 which is considerably less than the amount being sought for the Mount William site.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The difficulty facing my constituents is that unless this matter is resolved urgently, then they will continue to have poor reception and I will be grateful if you will investigate this matter as soon as possible to see whether the fee for use of facilities at the Mount William site can be dramatically reduced.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        By 18 May this year, I had not received a reply—too long after that. I therefore wrote directly to General Peter Gratian, the Chairman of the CAA, attaching a copy of my letter and asking him to provide me with an appropriate contact name with whom I could discuss this important issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I then received a letter on behalf of General Gratian dated 20 May and a letter dated 26 May from Mr Oates apologising for the oversight and for not responding to my letter sooner. I was told that a response was being prepared in head office which would address the issue. I then received a letter from the CAA dated 30 May in the following terms:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thank you for your facsimile to me of 18 May 1994. I understand that the Authority's Victorian Property Officer, Rod Oates, has already been in touch with you to apologise for not replying to your correspondence of 25 January 1994 that dealt with VicTV's proposed use of the communications site at Mount William.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You would be aware that the Civil Aviation Authority is a Government Business Enterprise whose costs are now borne directly by the Aviation Industry and not by the taxpayer. The Authority therefore took the decision that non-Aviation related users should contribute a modest but reasonable share of the costs associated with the development and operation of communication facilities such as those at Mount William. Given the charter set out in legislation, it would not be appropriate for the Authority to provide subsidies for community services outside its sphere of operation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I understand that the particular communications facility at Mount William is quite remote and required considerable expenditure by the Authority to construct the facility and provide access and services to the site. The revised fees, while regrettably high—

       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of this letter, I again wrote to VicTV and I finally received a reply dated 16 June in the following terms:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Commissioning of the translator to provide commercial television to the residents of Halls Gap has not progressed since our last correspondence because of operating costs proposed. Mt. William is the only suitable site in the Grampians National Park that enables coverage of the Halls Gap township. We understand there are three sites leased at Mt. William, two held by the Civil Aviation Authority and a third by the Ministry of Education.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A Civil Aviation Authority facility would be suitable for our requirements. It is our belief these facilities were constructed in the early 60's with public monies. The residents of Halls Gap are now being deprived a commercial television service. Fees to use these facilities are regrettably too high when compared to similar services offered by other parties including Government agencies, such as the National Transmission Agency. The large floor and tower space was built at Mt. William in the early 60's for manning and valve electronic equipment. This is no longer required due to miniaturisation of electronic equipment with no labour required at the remote site. Therefore, we suggest the Mt. William facility has excess capacity, and this is being underutilised at present.

         Honourable members would not be surprised to know that there is a total estrangement of Australian small and medium size business from the federal opposition. Business recognises that there is no-one on the opposition front bench who has the remotest idea on how to develop and implement sound policies on industry. The Liberal Party's tradition of bungling amateurism is frustrating business and frustrating even its own supporters.

          A recent article in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australian Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          referred to the long white shorts approach to policy making. The article by Gary Sturgess, a former Liberal Party staffer, was published on 14 October 1994. This deficiency in the Liberal Party is of serious concern to industry and the record shows that, without thoughtful, sensible policies, the opposition will pander to the worst excesses of the National Party. These issues include subsidies, protectionism and government handouts.

          Thanks to the ABC, 50 years of the Liberal Party are now being paraded in Australian homes. It is a most depressing saga. Included in these recollections is the Liberal Party's sorry record on industry. Narrow electoral interest led the Liberals to reject report after report recommending a more open Australian economy. The Liberal and National parties' tariffs and quotas stultified Australian industry. In 1994 the National Party continues to hanker after protection. The sugar and the tobacco industries would be only the start of its turning back the clock to the 1950s. Now that the Liberal Party has rejected the austere economic prescription of its exiled leader, the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), there are signs of recidivism appearing in its ranks.

          The most recent Liberal Party statement suggests that the anti-dumping provisions be used in a protectionist way. Further, the Liberal Party has not endorsed the government's tariff reduction schedule. Most seriously, the opposition has been providing encouragement to protectionists through its statements on foreign investment. Let me give an example. Investment is the driving force of business and economic growth. Australia's open economy is attracting investment from companies around the world. This investment is linking Australia into international technology and trade opportunities.

There are now 10 Australian companies on the international Fortune 500 list—companies such as BHP, Pacific Dunlop, CRA, Boral, CSR and Amcor.

          The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) states that he is not yet ready to deliver an economic statement. As an alternative to an economic statement, all he has done is produce the so-called The Things That Matter. Like Geoff Kitney, I regard the statement as a joke. It apes the worst excesses of the right wing psychobabble you hear in redneck America. In particular, the statement illustrates the distorted way the opposition views increased investment linkages in this country. The opposition laments foreign investment in Australia. It does not understand Australian business investment overseas and it does not understand what it means to have foreign investment under controlled circumstances in this country. Its utterances are designed, may I suggest, to cloak with respectability an appeal to racism and isolationism. It may succeed in that objective, but it will do so at the expense of its relations with business. There can be no turning back from being part of the international economy. Investment, trade, technology and globalisation are all interlinked.

          The opposition's The Things That Matter statement claims to be about boosting savings. In reality, all it would do is boost capital gains and fringe benefits tax rorts.

The opposition certainly does not do anything to enhance its standing. The fact is that these issues have to be treated seriously.

          There is no brain drain of scientists from Australia. In the 10 years from 1983-84 to 1992-93 Australia had a net inflow of 28,420 engineers and scientists. Science and technology and research and development in Australia are booming. The government is committed to maintaining 17 per cent growth in industrial R&amp;D until the end of the decade. This would put spending on R&amp;D by Australian industry up with the OECD average. It reverses the debacle of the Fraser years when spending by industry on R&amp;D collapsed and industrial research laboratories closed.

          In its public statements, the opposition calls for the maintenance of basic research in CSIRO and the universities, but in the Senate the opposition is playing politics with the organisation. This Senate review has wasted the time of CSIRO management. It has made it difficult for CSIRO to rationalise its laboratories and to redirect its research to priority areas. CSIRO has publicly available a widely respected mechanism of directing its resources. CSIRO provides almost four times the support for agricultural research as it does for mining and energy related research, even though agriculture and mining provide similar contributions to exports, and mining and energy make a greater contribution to Australia's gross domestic product.

         —I take this opportunity to congratulate the people of the northern suburbs for their passionate support, over the past two months, of the Coburg Football Club in its recent struggle with the powers that be. Those who follow Victorian football would be aware that there has been a major restructuring of domestic football in Victoria and that the Victorian Football Association, of which Coburg is a member club, has been subsumed into the AFL. Many people—and I am one of them—will lament the fact that the VFA's independence has been compromised.

         Given the continued expansion of the AFL and its domination of the football market—a bit like the globalisation that the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) was just talking about, but not as rosy—it was probably inevitable that the VFA would be marginalised. When the Sydney Swans were shifted to Sydney more than a decade ago with games televised back to Melbourne, the VFA, like local manufacturers in a global economy on a tilted `level' playing field, began to experience some difficulty. With the further telecasting of games from Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane, the VFA's share of the football market was soon reduced—like the market reduction which has been experienced by our local manufacturers.

         So often the much lauded increased attendance figures, about which the AFL boasts, are not assessed in the context of the football expansion which has occurred over the past decade. The effect of the VFL's expansion on the various domestic competitions would not be lost on South Australian and Western Australian football league supporters—just as it would not be lost on local manufacturers. The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) knows only too well what the advent of the Crows has meant for the local football competition.

         Although some members of this House have focused on the increased costs of AFL football and the fancy salaries the AFL pays its executives, the real matter of concern is that the AFL has shown scant regard for and little understanding of the role domestic and local football plays in the football economy. The contribution of volunteer labour and the in-kind contribution of local communities to the football economy, like the contribution of domestic labour—normally women—to GDP do not appear on the AFL corporate balance sheet. As has been pointed out by representatives of the VFA on one hand and women on the other, voluntary labour has always been taken for granted.

         The claim that it is only the elite game which generates wealth is, as I have said in a previous speech on this matter, best accounted for by way of Marx's theory of surplus value. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) would know that one back to front. That some AFL officials continue to argue this line is plain silly; that the government should decide to forgo the funding of local sporting and cultural groups following the so-called sports rorts affair is just as silly. So much for that.

         Back to the Coburg Football Club. Two months ago it appeared that, as a direct consequence of the economic rationalist formula driving the AFL's latest football blueprint, the Coburg Football Club was destined for the scrap heap of history. The proposition was that Melbourne could not support 12 senior clubs. As is the case with most arbitrary claims of this kind, no empirical evidence was provided to prove that Melbourne could support only eight clubs. Just for the record, the Coburg Football Club is 100 years old and has been in the VFA for 70 years. It last won premierships in 1988-89 when I was the coach. All of this history and sentiment counts for nothing in the mind of the new football administrator. Coburg, we were told, had to go. Fortunately, the people of the area saw it another way.

         It is 30 years since the Coburg Football Club has faced a football crisis of this kind. Ironically, it occurred as a result of the North Melbourne Football Club's occupation of the Coburg football ground in 1965. So committed to the club was the local community on that occasion that the ALP was decimated at the council elections which followed.

         Unfortunately, the Kennett government has made it impossible for such grand acts of democracy at the local level these days. Fortunately, during this latest crisis the people of the northern suburbs again showed their independent spirit and rallied to the call. In fact, it reminded me a bit of the Wills by-election; on that occasion the people of Wills refused to accept the lie that national policies, which were, in effect, devastating the local economy, were in their interest. It would pay the member for Herbert well, with all respect, to consider what globalisation does mean for local economies or institutions in local economies, whether they be manufacturers or sporting clubs—because the rosy picture painted just ain't the truth.

         I want to thank all of those Coburg supporters and others whose combined pledges provided the $15,000 licence fee which was paid today to the VFA and guaranteed the club a licence in the 1995 competition. That the local community could find that kind of money during difficult times, despite the rosy employment picture painted by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and, today, the member for Herbert, is a credit to its spirit and sense of commitment to its territory. I want to thank John Quigley, a local TCF manufacturer, for his great support; John is doing very innovative things with his business in Brunswick.

Nevertheless, I must thank Michael Jarvis from Ford, Brian Pilbeam from Kodak and Barry Fitzgerald from McDonald's Coburg, all of whom had the foresight to recognise the importance of supporting the local football club. I look forward to other transnationals and foreign investors, the sort that the member for Herbert talks about, acquiring an understanding of their responsibility to a locality from which they acquire so much in skill and knowledge. Globalisation should not mean an abrogation of social responsibility by employers, whether they be local manufacturers or multinationals. I think it is time our transnational companies accepted that it is not only millionaire tennis players and corporate sports which warrant sponsorship support. Some redistribution of wealth in the immediate locality would not go astray.

         —The Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill introduces a number of changes to the administration of a range of social security payments and, in so doing, gives effect to some of the measures announced in the 1994 budget and the white paper on employment and growth. It is pleasing to see that the government has responded to some clear anomalies within the welfare system. I trust it will continue this commitment to work towards eliminating the multitude of contradictions and inconsistencies which pepper this government's administration.

         It is worth noting at this stage that most of the amendments which this bill brings into effect would not be necessary if this government had a clear employment strategy. The white paper, along with its elder cousin, the One Nation statement, took a superficial approach to the problems of unemployment. Whilst there is no doubt that the unemployed need proper, targeted help, there is another side to the problem, that is, the need to work on the structural causes of unemployment. This is clearly where the government stumbles. When it gets to the hurdle of the structural problems which cause and contribute to unemployment, it stumbles. It just cannot bite the bullet. We all know that those heavies within the union movement say, `You can't jump that hurdle.' They put up higher and higher hurdles for the government; it continues to stare at those hurdles but it will not commit itself to taking on the heavies of the union movement.

         The government continues to sanction an inflexible, centralised industrial relations system and a raft of taxes and charges which actively discourage employers across this country from employing more staff. Until they are able to deal with these hurdles, full employment for those who wish to work will remain nothing but a dream. It is interesting to see that the government still fails to acknowledge the Industry Commission's work in this area. The government talks a great deal about regional development and its commitment to regional Australia, but it is really only rhetoric.

         The Industry Commission's report clearly shows that the greatest impediment to regional development in this country is industrial relations and the centralisation of the industrial relations system. If the government were committed to addressing the drift of population from regional and rural Australia to our capital cities, it would look again at the Industry Commission's report. It would look at the recommendations of the Industry Commission's report because the Industry Commission—an independent body, independent of this government—still holds to the view that industrial relations is the key to unlocking regional Australia. The government's inflexibility to the approach of the Industry Commission is going to remain the No. 1 impediment to regional development in this country.

         It is clearly apparent to members on this side of the House that the government has absolutely no intention of seriously dealing with the underlying and fundamental impediments to full employment. It would require breaking the crucial nexus between the union movement and the Labor Party, and there is clearly no hope of that occurring. It would require genuine commitment from the Labor Party to the productive industries of this nation—to sustainable manufacturing enterprises, to small business. Agriculture and mining collectively account for 70 per cent of the export income that we earn as a nation; they are part of the wealth creators of this nation. Such a commitment would be unprecedented for this government and one which I hold no hope for whilst ever the Labor Party holds the Treasury bench of this nation.

         In fact, it would be easy to believe that the federal government is now satisfied with its contribution to the problem of unemployment. The unemployment rate is now 9.5 per cent. The government appears to be saying, `We need to be congratulated.' Those on the other side of the House are showing a certain element of smugness that they have reduced unemployment to the level of 9.5 per cent; they feel that they ought to be congratulated for that. The unemployment rate is still appallingly too high, particularly in rural and regional Australia where youth unemployment is one of the great scars on this government's policy. In many parts of rural Australia, the youth unemployment rate is in excess of 40 per cent. That is an appalling indictment on any government that purports to want to see full employment in this nation.

I want this government to address the fundamental reasons why firms and businesses are not able to expand and thus employ more people. I want my children, and their children, to live in the type of world in which I grew up: where everyone who wanted work could get work, where they could resign from one job today and be in another job the next day. There was plenty of work in this country.

         The drought which currently afflicts the eastern states with such severity is further crippling the hopes which many parents held for their children. The dramatic cuts in income, which the drought has caused, mean that many farms can simply no longer support the full range of family members which may once have been possible. I know of some farmers who face the impossible task of deciding which of their sons and daughters should take over the farm, knowing full well it is no longer capable of supporting more than one family. As they are saying out there in rural Australia, the ultimate in child abuse is to even consider that your children would come home to the farm.

         On the eve of the release of the federal government's much awaited drought relief package, I received a phone call from a distressed lady in Central Queensland. She and her husband were both farm workers and in the space of three short years had seen their combined income fall from $32,000 a year to $20,000 a year. We are talking about the farm worker not the farm owner. The drought package has nothing to offer her or her family. Whilst the drought relief payment will put bread on the table in many farm kitchens, it will hardly extend as far as paying the wages of farm workers.

There is no longer any overtime because tractors are not being worked at all. There are no bonuses at the end of the year because there are no crops. That is why the farm workers are not receiving the sort of income they were earning three and four years ago. Obviously, they were paying tax on the overtime they worked and on the crop bonuses they received. They no longer receive the overtime payments as they no longer work those overtime hours, and they are not receiving any crop bonuses because of the drought. They are another victim of this drought.

This means that people will be required to serve only one liquid assets test waiting period in a 12-month period. The amendments also allow the employment of self-employed people to form part of their jobsearch and newstart activities. There are also three or four like amendments to the bill.

The government made them separate pieces of legislation to allow the Senate to deal with them separately because it may wish to amend them separately and therefore move at whatever speed is appropriate for the parliament.

He had some remarks to make about various parts of the legislation. He then proceeded to move an amendment to the legislation currently before the House which made reference to unemployment. Basically, this was an attempt to attach to the legislation words which attacked the government's acclaimed performance on unemployment; in fact they condemn the government.

In June 1983, the population of this country was 15 1/4 million. As of September this year, it is about 17,880,000. That is an increase in the population of over 2 1/2 million people.

That means that there are 2.9 per cent more people in the work force than there were previously. In numerical terms, there are 1.75 million more people working in Australia now than there were 11 years ago.

Some of us on this side of the House had hoped that we would see a compact between the parliament, the people and the unemployed. We thought that this was one issue that could unite Australia. The concept of the job compact gives the opposition the opportunity to recognise that the people out of work—and particularly those who have been unemployed for long periods—are worthy of better than cheap political point scoring and cheap stunts. I am sorry that that is not the case. One would have imagined that, with these minor amendments which those opposite are supporting, that would have been the case.

That has been discussed, argued about and various views canvassed publicly and privately for a number of years. The white paper was a profound government response not simply by ministers or by parliamentarians but by a range of people.

It will be an absolute tragedy if we see the same kind of performance as that which we have seen in the past, where speaker after speaker on the other side talks about everything but the legislation before the House, extols the need to increase employment levels, but does all he or she can to destroy morale and confidence and to talk down and to badmouth what is happening in this country.

If this is their approach, if this is how they are going to handle being in opposition for the next year or two, then they will be there after the next election as well. Quite frankly, it does not wash. People out there are not stupid. People know that unemployment is coming down and that the size of the work force is increasing. Most importantly of all, the majority of people want the government to do positive things. When the government is doing something positive, people understand that. On the one hand, the opposition supports proposals but, on the other hand, it tries to attack them publicly. It is too easy for people to see what those opposite are doing.

In the last 11 years, the population of this country has grown by 2.6 million people. The work force has grown by 1.75 million people. In other words, the work force has grown at a greater percentage rate than the population. If we had the same work force participation rate as we did in June 1983, the current unemployment rate would be 6.6 per cent. That is a credit both to the people in the community who have come back to the work force and to those people who have changed their career paths and their ideas. It is also a recognition that, as a government, we have actively encouraged people who were previously seen as being unemployed or wanting to stay unemployed to gain employment. We have also seen a shift in pension regimes and the introduction of support for people with disabilities, who see themselves more as workers than long-term invalid pensioners, which they were treated as then.

         A whole range of changes have helped to increase the size of our work force. That is to the good because, at the end of the day, a country's true strength is in its people; its true wealth is in its people. The bigger our work force, the stronger we will eventually become. The government's task is to mobilise that work force and to make it function. The white paper addresses that issue in a more profound way than it has been addressed for many decades.

In fact, I would have thought that we could not move a more important amendment in this place than that which we have moved, which condemns the government for `its policies which have created record levels of unemployment', for `its inability to address the associated social inequity and hardship which has resulted', and for `its failure to solve the ongoing unemployment crisis, in particular, the problem of long-term unemployment'. It is a completely legitimate amendment which needs to be discussed in this parliament.

It is interesting that the member for Newcastle should suggest that the government is doing things to fix up unemployment in a structural sense, because all the evidence points to the contrary. The fact is the government has had to be dragged in screaming to do anything as far as micro-economic or industrial relations reform is concerned.

         That is why, when we talk about the government's white paper, we must point out that, philosophically, we are miles apart in terms of the solution to unemployment. Time and again in this place government members tell us all about the schemes, programs and initiatives that they have cooked up to solve the problem of unemployment; the problem that they created in the first place. Yet, in the end, they are only that—they are schemes; they are bandaid solutions to the problem of unemployment.

         The fact that the honourable member for Newcastle mentioned participation rates provides further evidence for that particular argument. It is not realistic to say that if the participation rates were at the same level 10 years ago as they are today, the unemployment rate would be lower. The government's whole modus operandi is to put pressure on participation rates. That is the government's solution to unemployment. In some respects that may be a legitimate strategy.

         Something that I find interesting is that the government crows about its achievements in getting young people to participate in education. It cites that as a major success. Of course, everybody knows it just stumbled on that as a partial solution to the problem. But it has grasped the fact that, if it takes people out of the unemployment queue and puts them into some program or scheme, it takes them out of unemployment and affects participation rates. At the same time, a number of people become discouraged about looking for jobs in times of economic difficulty. That affects participation rates as well.

         Many of the government's efforts have been to actually put pressure on participation rates to keep people off the unemployment list. I think that has become evident to everybody in the community. As members of parliament, we have become aware of the fact that there are so many extremely well qualified unemployed people running around out there that a lot of these mickey mouse schemes have been exposed for what they are. Each of us has had, on a regular basis, people coming to us who have been on course after course or training program after training program. They have a sheaf of certificates that qualify them for all sorts of things. But the fact is that there are no jobs. That is the argument all the time.

         Over time, employment growth is a natural phenomenon. We do not have to do anything in particular to create jobs. That happens in a dynamic economy just by virtue of the effluxion of time. I do not think there is any doubt about that. But the point is that the government has attempted, wherever possible, to make the unemployment figures look better than they are. It will continue to do that in all sorts of ways. Only time will tell whether it has had any real success in creating jobs. I think it will tell a very sad story indeed—as we have a lot of unemployed people.

         One of the reasons the government cannot create real jobs is that it did not come to grips with some of the real solutions until very recently. The government has been dragged screaming into providing incentives for employers to provide jobs. The real incentive there is to recognise such things as a training wage. Of course, from an industrial relations point of view, such a concept, even at the last election, was a total anathema to the government—any suggestion that the solution to unemployment might be to recognise that young people, in particular, and some long-term unemployed people were not worth as much as the award system an employer had to pay. That was very obvious, but the government recognised that only recently and came up with a solution to it, such as a training wage, which it has instituted within the constraints of the industrial relations system.

         In the end, industrial relations reform is a very real part of a solution to unemployment. It is part of a long-term solution and it is part of a lasting solution. The government has been very slow to actually do something about the industrial relations system. Of course, in the last few years, we have seen it go partly down the track of enterprise agreements to reach a solution, which will bring about a real reduction in unemployment and a real creation of jobs. But it has been very slow getting there.

         On the other side of the coin, there are all sorts of other constraints on employment. The industrial relations legislation, which we dealt with in this place not so long ago, makes it much more difficult for employers to terminate the employment of somebody. The rigmarole that is involved in terminating the employment of somebody—for perfectly legitimate reasons in the majority of cases—has meant simply that most employers are now saying, `If we can't fire them, we won't hire them.'

         It shows how out of touch the government must be—other than with its union mates that call the tune in this area—when it introduces legislation, such as we had at a time of high unemployment, which simply will not motivate employers to take on an employee. Its solution is to say to an employer, `You can now employ someone who has been long-term unemployed, for a year or two, for next to nothing.' In fact, the subsidies are so generous that the catchcry is that you can employ someone for about $10 a week. It shows again that the government is so out of touch with how a business should work. Even $10 a week would be too much for employers who are not motivated to employ somebody when that person would be making a contribution to their business. That is a reason why these sorts of approaches will not work.

We all realise the huge gap there is there, and we have only just started to make even a dent on that problem. They also said, `I will employ someone, if I can actually find somebody.'

I have employers telling me that, when they are in the process of hiring somebody, some people come in with a form that they want signed by the employer to indicate that they have applied for a job. I believe that this is widespread. They have got no intention of working. In fact, they almost say to the employer up-front, `I am sorry to have to do this to you, but I have to get you to sign the form; otherwise they will take the dole off me.

That is the reason for the amendment proposed by the member for Berowra, which will be strongly supported by this side of the House.

It is fine for it to talk about the unemployment numbers coming down—with its manipulation of participation rates and all the other things it manages to do to get the numbers down a bit—and about creating a bit of job growth. It has put in huge amounts of money. How much is it? It is talking about $10 billion over four years to create these jobs, so they become extremely expensive jobs. The real point is that, instead of having about 850,000 unemployed, we actually have closer to two million unemployed in this country.

         People may not be aware of how generous the measure of employment is. The way the government counts unemployment probably puts the very best complexion on it that can be reached. The government does it by a survey method. People who take part in that survey are told that if they worked one hour per week they are classed as employed. By the government's definition, if you work one hour per week you are employed! Once you count all of these people who are part-time workers—and there is a huge number of people now who are part-time workers—you are probably talking closer to two million unemployed and underemployed in the Australian economy. If you wanted to put some sort of a figure on that, you would be looking at billions of dollars of lost production.

         I want to make a few remarks about the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill. Currently there is approximately a $500 million imbalance in the welfare payments to New Zealanders living in Australia when contrasted with those of Australians living in New Zealand. As I understand it, this arrangement was originally put in place many years ago. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went to New Zealand in May 1993 with the intention of doing something about redressing this imbalance or, at least, partially redressing it. In the event, of course, he went nowhere near redressing it. Because we have such an extraordinarily generous welfare system, there are many more New Zealanders here—I suppose, in fairness, that is also related to the difference in the populations between the two countries.

         I was over in New Zealand just a couple of weeks ago. Its economy is starting to boom; it is way ahead of ours. New Zealand has done many of the things that we ought to have done. In fact, in terms of its fiscal position as far as the government budget is concerned, it is virtually in surplus now. It is in a position where it can talk about doing some of the things that we ought to be able to do. As I understand it, the current budget situation is very healthy. Its ports, for instance, are way ahead of ours. It has taken a lot of the hard decisions that we have yet to take in this country.

          Australian
         </emphasis>
         by Mike Steketee not very long ago which dealt with `Keating's 1,000 days'. It talks about some of the problems the government has created for this country. Mike Steketee says in his article that the 1980s brought prosperity to more Australians but that it also left more of them behind. The percentage of Australian populations receiving welfare benefits as their primary form of income rose from 10 per cent in 1971 to 27.5 per cent in 1992: that is, 4.4 million people in this country now have welfare payments of some sort as their primary source of income. Though the population is ageing, the government's assets and income tests—some of which have been quite draconian—have ensured that it is not the aged who have swollen that number but rather the unemployed, and sole parents and their children.

Many of these people are self-funded retirees. Some of the government's draconian—I use that word again—assets and income tests have had a very real effect on these people. We have a whole range of new poor people out there. To the government's credit, it has instituted a detailed review of the assets and income test. The options paper that has already been brought forward has been very positive. But the government has taken some decisions in the past which have severely affected some pensioners and self-funded retirees. In particular, its decision to tax unrealised capital gains was one that we objected to most strongly and will continue to do so as one that had an adverse effect on some pensioners and self-funded retirees.

         There are quite a number of proposed changes to social security arrangements in this legislation but, as the  amendment from the coalition so adequately demonstrates, the reason why we have these new measures is fundamentally the government's inability to come to grips with the unemployment crisis, which is the obvious symptom, the obvious evidence, of the government's economic failure, the evidence of its inability to introduce appropriate industrial relations mechanisms and to provide the sort of economy that encourages Australian business to save and to invest and, therefore, to create worthwhile and productive jobs in the community. So, sadly, a large number of Australians—one million or two million—are unemployed or underemployed. The social security system needs to provide income for them so they can survive until, hopefully, a coalition wins government.

         There are a number of measures included in the bill which the coalition does not oppose in their substance. I would like to comment particularly on the proposal to enable advance payments to be made as a proportion of jobsearch and newstart allowances. Under this legislation, from 20 March next year, certain recipients of jobsearch and newstart will have access to an advanced payment. Recipients who satisfy the qualification conditions will have the option of capitalising up to 14 per cent of their payments, with an advance payment range of $250 to $500 over a six-month period, or an advance payment range of $500 to $1,000 over a 12-month period. The advance payment will be repaid by deductions from ongoing JSA and NSA payments. Clients will have the option of either increasing the amounts of deductions to repay the advance payment earlier or applying to have the deductions lowered if they are suffering severe hardship or if they can demonstrate that they are having difficulty with the repayments.

         I think that the idea of providing advance loans against a social security entitlement has considerable merit. It is an idea that I put to the government only a few months ago in relation to the payment of social security benefits. I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) is at the table, because she is the one who responded to my representations. Indeed, the sorts of things she said to me only last May are completely different from what the government is now doing in this legislation. Last April I put to the then Minister for Social Security an idea of a constituent of mine, Mr Roberts. Mr Roberts suggested that there ought to be a general loan scheme introduced to enable pensioners to borrow for essential capital items and that those loans could then be repaid by lower social security payments in the future.

         Mr Roberts was on a disability support pension and wanted to purchase a second-hand motor vehicle to enable him to drive to the shops and adopt a more independent lifestyle. If he got this motor vehicle he would have saved governments the cost of subsidising his taxi fares and other measures available to him. He was unable to obtain the necessary loan funds from any financial institution, so he suggested that the government support a loan scheme which would enable him and others to borrow against future entitlements. That would have given Mr Roberts a little capital grant to enable him to purchase a motor vehicle and improve his lifestyle. He felt that, as a result of that, he could live on a lower pension payment. Mr Roberts maintained that sometimes a capital advance would enable a pensioner to make a purchase which would improve his lifestyle substantially and reduce future living expenses. I think that Mr Roberts's own case was an excellent example of how such a scheme could be used to advantage.

         The government has done something not dissimilar with the home improvement scheme that is available. Age pensioners and others can now borrow a certain amount to make necessary improvements to their homes. That money is eventually repaid or is deducted from their estates. I think that is an excellent scheme. Unfortunately, that scheme is not well administered. There are all sorts of anomalies and difficulties associated with the way in which it operates, but the principle is good. When I put this to the then Minister for Social Security, I got a reply quite promptly from the parliamentary secretary at the table. She said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . I regret that the Department of Social Security is not only unable to assist him with funding, but has no charter to undertake a scheme of this type.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course it does not have any charter to do it at present; it is not within the current scope. That is why I was writing to the minister—to suggest that he amend the legislation to fix the problem. To just say that the legislation does not allow it is, in my view, a failure to address the issue. The parliamentary secretary then went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is because the assistance available from the Department is intended to provide ongoing income support for people who for reasons such as age, ill-health, unemployment or family commitments are unable to adequately provide for themselves. There are no provisions in social security legislation which allow funds to be granted to finance the purchase of motor vehicles and the Minister has no discretion under the law to grant such funding. Similarly, there are no provisions to allow income support payments to be paid as a capital advance as this would be contrary to the underlying principle of the social security system.
       </para>

        So it is contrary to the principle of the social security system to enable pensioners, the unemployed, the aged and invalids to get any degree of independence. It is repugnant to the government to give them any independence, but now we have a scheme that will permit independence for unemployed people. I think that is a very curious double standard that the government is adopting. Now that it has pioneered this idea with the jobsearch allowance and the newstart allowance, I hope that it works successfully and may then encourage the parliamentary secretary to reconsider what she wrote in her letter to my constituent. I also hope that it may encourage the government to look again at the overall issue of advancing loans to pensioners and welfare recipients.

         The idea has some difficulties and that is going to especially be the case with the proposal the government is introducing. I would have thought it would be much simpler to administer the scheme proposed by my constituent than the one included in this legislation. For instance, what happens if the scheme is successful in its objective and the grant of $500 or $1,000 enables people to get a job? In those circumstances, people will cease to be beneficiaries of jobsearch and newstart allowances. They will not be able to get these benefits from which the repayments are supposed to be deducted. The government will not be able to deduct repayments from jobsearch allowance payments because people will not be getting the allowance. The government will have to use some other system to recover the money. It can either send these people a bill and hope they will pay it or, alternatively, take them to court. Would it not be the height of stupidity if the government were to try to take one of its jobsearch allowance recipients to court to recover a debt of $250? The lawyers would get tens of thousands of dollars and the government's return would be $250. In reality, it is not going to be a practical way of collecting the funds.

         What if people who receive the allowance cease to become eligible for jobsearch for some other reason—for example, they fail to meet the activity test—and the jobsearch allowance is cut off?

What if the new jobs these people get are self-employed ventures where their incomes are extremely low but they are unable to front for interviews with other employers because they are engaged full time in their own projects which are not yet returning significant incomes? How will the funds be recovered in those circumstances?

I think that there are going to be some difficulties in that regard. Having said that, in principle, I support the idea of a loan scheme. I think it has potential to give people the opportunity to start a new career.

         While we are dealing with social security issues, I note that a number of matters in this bill deal with family payments. I want to refer briefly to the government's home child-care debacle. That is all it can really be described as—a monumental debacle. The whole scheme started with the government getting involved in a lavish television and newspaper advertising campaign which suggested that, under the home child-care allowance, single income families were about to get another $60 a fortnight. That advertisement was grossly misleading; nonetheless, many families believed the government when it sent them information saying they were going to get an extra $60 a fortnight.

         I am dealing with a constituent at present who, on the basis of that extra $60 payment, went to a bank. This person was granted a home loan on the basis of his improved financial circumstances. This person got only one payment and it was then chopped off. Now the bank is starting to ask this person how he is going to meet his future repayments. This is a classic case of the hurt inflicted by the government's deliberately misleading campaign. The campaign endeavoured to create the impression that the government was doing something for people that, in reality, it was not.

         Single income families are not $60 better off. The only $60 they receive replaces the spouse rebate which they previously received. By comparison, it is interesting to note that two-income families will receive up to $120 a fortnight towards their child-care costs, but this has been quietly promoted through child-care centres instead of on public television. The $120 child-care cash rebate is not subject to an income test, whereas the smaller $60 home child-care allowance for single income families is reduced in value once the recipient's income reaches the handsome figure of $5 a week. Indeed, the whole thing has caused enormous confusion in the community.

This means that a family whose breadwinner earns $100,000 a year—or, for that matter, any amount—but whose child carer earns nothing is eligible to receive the allowance. However, because of the partners allowance which has now been introduced, which effectively splits unemployment benefits between both members of an unemployed couple, the child carer's income will be too high to receive the HCCA.

         It is a strange program where a family with an income of about $14,000 a year is means tested out of getting the child-care allowance while some families earning over $100,000 a year will get it. This is Labor's idea of welfare. It comes from the same stable as child care for the rich, which enables people with massive incomes to get cash subsidies for child care in child-care centres. There is an enormous inconsistency in the way in which the government is dealing with these matters. But that is not all.

The tax office requires accountants to phase their tax returns in favour of those who are going to pay the most tax. In other words, high income taxpayers have their tax returns prepared first and the tax returns of low income earners—the ones that pay no tax—are often not lodged for six or nine months after the end of the financial year.

         The next part of the debacle occurred when the government introduced and made the first payment on 29 September, but the companion tax legislation is not yet through the parliament and is unlikely to be approved in its current form. The home child-care allowance, as I mentioned earlier, is intended to replace the dependent spouse rebate for parents with children, but the legislation amending the dependent spouse rebate is likely to be changed in the Senate. It still has certainly not received passage through this parliament.

         The federal government has now spent a large amount of money advertising and telling employers that they cannot deduct the extra tax from pay packets which will apply after the dependent spouse rebate has been abolished. Many people are currently getting both the home child-care allowance and the dependent spouse rebate, but they will have to pay back the dependent spouse rebate. I am told that as many as 420,000 families will get a delayed tax bill when the legislation eventually goes through this parliament. What an appalling indictment on government administration! The legislation for one of the significant elements of this package is not through the parliament. Payments have started. People are getting money which they will have to repay. When the bills finally come, there will be acute embarrassment in thousands and thousands of families around Australia. Let them place the blame clearly where it belongs—not with the social security department, which is having to face this matter at its counter, not with the tax office or any other government agencies, but with the federal ALP government and its incompetent management of its legislative program.

         Another interesting aspect is the introduction of the partner allowance, which has meant that some people have received a one-off $60 payment which the government never intended them to receive. That has helped lead to the confusion that I referred to earlier. People are getting the money. They naturally assume, following the advertising campaign, that they are entitled to have it. They are spending it, going off and developing new budgets on the basis of their new financial affairs, and they will find out to their sorrow some time in the future—a month's time, two months, maybe six months—that the money given to them is money they are not entitled to receive. I think the government owes it to these people to tell them personally, to front up and present the true situation about the mess that it has created in relation to home child-care payments.

That is part of the reason why the cost of running the social security department is well over a billion dollars a year.

As I stated—and at least I spoke in the Working Nation debate—the government's primary commitment remains the resolution of the unemployment problem.

         We as a government do acknowledge that unemployment is a problem, but we have put into place real solutions. Working Nation always maintained that, as the economy improved and business investment accelerated, jobs would flow. Figures, I am pleased say, released last week by the ANZ Bank indicated that the government's employment activities are almost certain to be exceeded over the next 18 months. There is too much good news on the employment front to take the carping criticism of the opposition seriously. I mean that most sincerely. It is obviously too much for the shadow spokesperson for social security and all the other opposition speakers that we have had today, and I will comment on a few of those speeches later.

         When the member for Berowra, the shadow spokesperson for social security, first got up to speak I thought that he was going to support the government's agenda, the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill and the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill before the House. On rereading his speech, I find that he stated, `We will not oppose but,' and `The measure will not be opposed but,' and of course we always have to wait for the `but'. I would like to return to the substance of the honourable member for Berowra's less than passionate response to this legislation before the House.

         reporters, the member for Berowra mixed the economic outcomes of the close economic, social and political relationship between Australia and New Zealand with the outcomes of the recently negotiated agreement between the two countries regarding pensions. In response to that criticism, I would like to make the following two points. Firstly, the member for Berowra talked about the estimated so-called $500 million shortfall per annum, and it was compounded by other speakers from the coalition in their input to the debate. I know that figure came out in a press release, but at no time was it used by us or by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That so-called suggested shortfall, as implied by those speakers who have used it and certainly as implied by the member for Berowra, is the cost that this government is going to bear. The member for Berowra and members of the coalition know better.

         Secondly, that $500 million represents total outlays for Australians and New Zealanders who have lived and worked in Australia for the majority of their working lives. Some of those New Zealanders may have come here as one-year-olds, babes in arms. Australia could never expect to receive those reimbursements.

The message that the honourable member for Berowra wants to give here is that those men and women from New Zealand who have dedicated their working lives to the economic prosperity of this country, Australia, who have bred and raised their children in this country, Australia, who have set down their roots in this country, Australia, are those same men and women who are now to be told that they are no longer welcome in this country and rendered ineligible for benefits.

         I also dare say that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, have also implied that the taxpayers of Australia are paying for this so-called shortfall. By statements made by the opposition, we are saying to these men and women from New Zealand who have, as I said, lived and reared their children in this country that they are not eligible for any benefits. The agreement achieves a far better deal for both countries than is presently in existence.

         There are a number of other points in the notes that I took while the honourable member for Berowra was talking so many weeks ago. He also commented, as you did, Mr Deputy Speaker, about persons employed or who obtained employment and came off payments. I feel I have to answer him, as I would have to answer you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Any outstanding amount of the advance payment becomes a debt to the Commonwealth and it is recoverable by legal proceedings, garnishee, et cetera. I feel that has to be repeated, even though it is well known.

         Another point I wish to raise—it was raised by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your speech today—is that I can well and truly recollect that the so-called proposed amendment that the opposition wanted to move in relation to the HCCA program was going to allow children to leave the country. At least in the amendment that we have before the House today, if the whole family leaves the country the child has to remain here if they wish to continue to receive that payment.

         The member for Berowra also made reference to the age pension article—he made a great to-do about that in his speech—where it stated that age pensioners can be `assured of continuing support'. I say to the honourable member for Berowra and the opposition: the words mean exactly what we intend them to mean. We make no apologies for that. Those words are there to reassure pensioners that they will not lose, and we will continue to reassure pensioners that they will not lose. That was the intended meaning of those words. We will continue to state that we are proud of what we have put in that statement. But, if the honourable member for Berowra does not understand it and needs a briefing occasionally, we can always provide that for him. We are always very courteous in that respect. That is why I say again that some of the comments that have been made during the debate are quite ludicrous.

I referred you at that time to the honourable member for Berowra's speech. What I was referring to during your speech was the fact that you were rereading what he had already stated in the House as to what was going to happen if a person came off the payment.

         I turn now to the speech made by the honourable member for Maranoa. I was waiting for him with great delight. He came into the House and started to speak on the legislation, and I thought that finally we would get an input from the coalition that would deal with the legislation before the House. But what did we get? We heard about the three mines policy, the uranium policy. We heard about our conference. At least the Labor Party conference is reported in the press, which is more than I can say for the Liberal Party's conference; we have not even heard what happened there. We then heard about drought, about bonuses, about farmers and about farm workers. We heard about relief packages. We heard about the family farming unit. We heard about the white paper. We heard about youth unemployment. We got blamed for everything but the drought. During his 20-minute speech, not once did he mention or touch on one of the items in that legislation.

         We then went on to the speech made by the honourable member for McPherson. He went on about the amendment before the House and spoke of the high rate of unemployment. On the day that this amendment was moved, perhaps the honourable member for Berowra and even the honourable member for Cowan had not been brought up to date with the current unemployment figures, so I suppose we could forgive them. But to have you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the honourable member for McPherson get up and go on about employment and unemployment when the latest figures are here and available is not only rude but absolutely ridiculous.

         Perhaps I had better revise the figures for the honourable member for McPherson in case he too did not understand or appreciate them. The ABS figures in August—and this is even before this amendment was moved—showed the unemployment figures as being 830,500, the lowest level they have been since August 1991. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was very pleased with those figures and he put out a press release. He said:

        He continued:

        Also encouraging is the continued fall in long term unemployment which is now 290,000, down from a peak of 366,000 in March 1993 . . . The number of people on unemployment allowances has fallen by more than 60,000 over the last year.

        If that was not enough information—perhaps the people on the opposition benches did not want to read about it—we then had a question in the House on 11 October, only last week. To compound what I say is outright misinformation, if not lies, after not only a press release put out by the minister, there are the ABS statistics which clearly show where we rate now with our employment and unemployment figures. We then have, in answer to a question on unemployment, the minister stating:

The ABS in its most recently published statistic puts the level of long-term unemployed at 290,000—the lowest in 31 months.  . . .              . . .             . . .

        But then I thought that possibly was not enough because the honourable member for McPherson went on to say that we jiggled the figures—all of a sudden we should forget the ABS and ANZ figures, we had jiggled them. Somehow or other the government had just pulled these rabbits out of a hat. By doing that, he says that we made sure that the figures presented by all of these authorities were not really correct.

         We then found from Social Security that the number of unemployment benefit recipients was cut by 14,363 in September—and they were the figures we released; we found that job seekers, receiving either the jobsearch allowance for people unemployed for less than 12 months or the newstart allowance for those long-term unemployed, fell by 1.7 per cent to 839,161. Our Department of Social Security figures also showed a 422,440 or 2.2 per cent fall—I repeat the word `fall'—in the number of jobsearch recipients in September. Our newstart recipients fell by 4,210 or one per cent to 416,721. Since August last year, as has been repeated again and again, there have been 340,000 new jobs created. I say to the honourable member for McPherson and all of the other coalition members who spoke about employment and unemployment: when you have the facts before you, why ignore them? Why not at least acknowledge them? They are figures that have been provided, are factual and can be backed up and by our Department of Social Security figures as well.

         Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, during your speech you touched on a lot of the things that had been covered by previous speakers. I would like to talk about a couple of things. I would like to bring home to the coalition the fact that we are broadening the range of work related options for our long-term unemployed. In introducing the advance payment option, we are hoping to provide assistance for those people who need it—whether it be to find a job or other activities related to finding employment. We hope that will assist them; we know it will. That is why that has been brought forward in this legislation.

         Quite frankly, I do not believe the government needs any criticism of the bills before the House. I believe that since we came to government in 1983 our record on social security has been second to none. The real value of pensions has increased by some 14 per cent. There has been an enormous expansion in family payments and rent assistance. The maximum rate of assistance to our low income working families with two children under the age of 13 and renting privately has increased by $64 or some 108 per cent in real terms. Measures to improve access have resulted in a tenfold increase in the take-up of additional family payments.

        This bill proposes the repeal of the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. The repeal is part of a package of changes designed to streamline and refocus the Commonwealth's involvement in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory.

         Three main features of the package of reforms, which were implemented by the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Amendment Act 1993, are: the incorporation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency; refined mechanisms for consulting key stakeholders, including the traditional owners and the Northern Land Council; and allowing the Alligator Rivers Research Institute to undertake research on matters outside the region on a commercial basis. The reforms also include the conduct of an independent review of the research now needed to meet the Commonwealth's environment protection objectives in the region.

         The uranium export levy was introduced in 1980 in recognition of the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. However, with diminishing exports from the Alligator Rivers Region due to the closure of the Nabarlek mine and declining exports from the Ranger mine due to the poor state of the market for uranium, levy collections have become uncertain.

         The government has also recognised that there was a general benefit to the community associated with the work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and this portion should not be borne by the uranium industry. Ranger, as the sole producer in the region and the only one contributing to the levy, should therefore not be expected to meet the full costs of these activities.

         The levy was also seen as inequitable to Ranger as there is no similar levy applying to any other mineral commodity. It also hinders Ranger's competitiveness, including against Roxby Downs in South Australia, where the export levy does not apply. As a result, the uranium export levy has come to be seen by the government as an inappropriate mechanism for collecting an industry contribution to the special costs of environmental protection required for the region.

         Consequently, the government has sought a mechanism which more directly relates the industry's contribution to the environmental research needs of the region and provides some certainty in its collection. It has therefore decided to replace the contribution previously collected by the uranium export levy with a contractual arrangement with Energy Resources of Australia Ltd, otherwise known as ERA.

         This arrangement provides for the annual payment of at least $1.5 million to the Commonwealth. The agreement is subject to review after two years or in the event of any significant change in mining circumstances. The environmental research needs of the region have recently been reviewed by a team of independent consultants and will be the subject of ongoing review through the technical committee established by the recent amendments to the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978.

         In return for ERA's financial contribution to research, the Commonwealth has undertaken to repeal the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980.

This bill removes the uranium export levy by repealing its parent legislation.

However, as the export duty is to be repealed on the condition that ERA agree to an annual contribution of at least $1.5 million to research in the Alligator Rivers Region, there is no net financial impact as a result of the measures contained in this bill.

         —I rise this evening to address the issues of Australian manufacturers. I refer specifically this evening to Hardeman and Rolls Packaging Pty Ltd, which manufactures in my electorate Australia Post Express Post bags. It is important to support Australian manufacturers.

         Hardeman and Rolls Packaging Pty Ltd manufactures in my electorate the Australia Post Express Post bag that I am holding. In fact, another Express Post bag, of a somewhat different quality, is manufactured in New Zealand. I find it rather interesting that currently the one manufactured in Australia is produced for 1c per bag less than the one manufactured in New Zealand. But the New Zealand company, whose parent company operates out of the United States, has 95 per cent of the market for these bags that are produced for Australia.

         A tender is coming up for this particular bag in November this year. They talked about this with some of the Australia Post people and they said they were comfortable with purchasing the bag from the New Zealand manufacturer—something my constituent is concerned about. I do not want to make an issue of their being comfortable or otherwise, but if the bag is of as good a quality as—and I am assured that it is—and is cheaper than the one being produced in New Zealand I would have thought there would be a responsibility for Australian organisations, particularly Australia Post, to purchase from Australian manufacturers.

         I find it also interesting that, whilst there is a requirement to display `Made in Australia' on most of our articles, there is nothing to identify the bag as being made in New Zealand. In fact, on the reverse side of this bag three patent numbers are quoted. Rather interestingly, nobody seems to be able to find any reference to the first of those. The second patent number—patent No. 207248—on the back of the bag is actually to do with the treatment of textiles. I would have thought that had very little to do with this particular bag. The other patent number—patent No. 202637—is a patent relating to apparatus for dispensing liquids.

         It amazes me that, when we are talking about quality in so many areas in this country and we demand Australian manufacturers to get it right and have accuracy, we have a bag that is not even manufactured in this country and says nothing about where it comes from. I think most Australians would be horrified to find out that, even though we can produce this bag in this country at a cheaper price, it is not being purchased by Australia Post. Australia Post is purchasing a bag that does not even have the right information when it comes to patents in this country.

         One of the arguments I have heard from a number of manufacturers—and I have to say that this is not one that has been raised by this particular company, but it is one that concerns me—is that we buy from overseas companies rather than Australian companies because of the opportunities to go overseas and check out the products. For an Australian manufacturer who has laid his house on the line to make sure his business survives during a recession, it would leave a bit of a nasty taste. In this case, the particular gentleman involved had to buy out a partner because they could not afford to have the two of them operating the company in the manner they would have liked during the recession, only to find that 95 per cent of those bags are purchased overseas.

         —Last Saturday night in my electorate of Oxley, which includes the city of Ipswich, the local greyhound racing club conducted an auction and a number of other fundraising initiatives to raise much needed funds for the drought relief appeal. It is hoped that these funds will assist those in our area of south-east Queensland. Tonight I would like to offer my congratulations to the club manager of the Ipswich Greyhound Racing Club, Chris Williams. This fundraising event was one of Chris's initiatives. He is a great fellow and a great community minded person. Chris took it upon himself to organise this fundraising activity for the drought relief program. Part of it was in the form of an auction, with prize money and donations from generous people in the community.

         I think this goes to show the generosity of Australians when their fellow Australians are in great need. All of us in this House know how our friends in the rural sector, particularly those in Queensland and New South Wales, are suffering from the drought at the present time. Some $164 million from the Commonwealth government's drought relief program has already gone a long way to assisting these people. I think we should acknowledge in this place the moral support offered by our friends in the rural community and in this case the people in my community.

I acknowledge the efforts of my local community. I am very proud to have been associated with that event. Chris invited my wife and me along on that evening.

A couple of greyhound pups, various items of equipment used in greyhound racing and some pot plants were donated and auctioned on the night. Mr Speaker, I mentioned to you earlier this afternoon that Chris, the club manager, got so enthusiastic with the auction that he ripped off his tie and auctioned it. I thought at the time that if only we could have had one of the Speaker's ties, we would have done well. Chris managed to get $40 for his tie on the night. His wife told me later that she paid only $10 for it. We have to see whether we can buy Chris a new tie. Mr Speaker, if you could donate one of your ties some time, I am sure he would appreciate it for future auctions. It is certainly a great way to raise money.

         —There is a terrible fate awaiting the tobacco industry of Australia, particularly the two-thirds to three-quarters of it that exists in North Queensland. Our cost of production can be roughly considered to be around $6 a kilogram and the international price is around $4 a kilogram. The only reason we have been able to effectively stay in the tobacco industry is that the home content rule says that if producers do not accept 50 per cent Australian tobacco in cigarettes a very punitive tariff would be applied. The net result is that we have had not 50 per cent but pretty close to 57 per cent Australian tobacco in our cigarettes.

         With the onrush of the GATT legislation—and I must say that whoever negotiated on behalf of the tobacco industry did a deplorable job—we now have a situation in which we will be at the tender mercies of the marketplace and the industry will be abolished. I use that term `abolished' because I can see no hope for any part of the industry continuing to exist in the face of international competition. Tobacco is a very labour intensive product. We are competing against $1.60 a day wage rates in the corporate farms in Africa and $2 a day wage rates in the corporate farms in Central America and South America. So we are non-competitive through no fault of our own but through the fault of people who do not choose to pay a decent wage.

         We have only two choices in our industry: to drive our wages down to that level, or to close down the industry. When it closes down, not only the farming side of the industry will close down, taking down 2,000 jobs with it, but also the manufacturing side will close down. There is no logic attached to manufacturing cigarettes in Australia, where we simply cannot work on economies of scale in competition against the United States with its huge market, or China with its huge market. So the manufacturing side of the industry will go as well, and some 6,000 Australian jobs will be lost.

Somebody has to be hellishly wrong here. Since then, some people have argued against me and pointed out that it was GATT illegal and has been knocked on the head. That does not detract from the fact that the legislature in the United States was heading in one direction and the legislature in Australia was heading in the exact opposite direction.

It is a decision of this government that has broken these farmers and delivered them into bankruptcy in a community of 12,000 or 15,000 people.

         We need to divert a bit of water, but we cannot do that diversion unless there is some money coming from somewhere. It most certainly will not be coming from the state coffers; the state government has made that clear and unequivocal. It said, `The federal government has created the problem; it's for the federal government to fix up that problem.' But if we can  deliver a two million tonne sugar mill to the Australian economy, then we are talking about $50 million, $100 million, $150 million, maybe even as much as $200 million in years to come—and all of this for the sake of just a single cent. All of that heartbreak and destruction will be eliminated for the sake of a single cent on cigarettes. That is all we require, and we can deliver back to Australia a very bright future, not only for the people of the area but also for the greater Australian nation.

         —Regrettably, I rise to present a case study of how the government is treating low income families in my electorate in this, the International Year of the Family. Some time ago the government promised to help low income families by introducing a home child-care allowance—I think it was not that long before the 1993 election. As highlighted by my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) many times, the home child-care allowance—or the HCCA—has been nothing but a farce from day one.

         The confusion created by HCCA is typical of much new legislation coming from the government. The Department of Social Security has been ill-informed on HCCA's introduction and is sceptical of the government's publicity about its benefits. Families are confused about its introduction and the abolition of the dependent spouse rebate. Debate is still going on in this place about the final structure of HCCA, with the government recently acknowledging that some people will be worse off when it is introduced.

         I draw an example from my electorate of what HCCA is doing. One of my constituents was advised by my office that, according to the Department of Social Security guidelines, she would not be eligible for HCCA, despite her low income. This was because the government had also introduced the partner allowance—not a new payment, but a new way of paying the jobsearch and newstart allowances to couples. She would be receiving half of her husband's unemployment benefit. Because she was receiving this money under her own name, she would not be able to get the allowance since under HCCA's guidelines she would be earning too much.

         Some weeks later, she called my electorate office to say she had, in fact, received the allowance. She had a letter from the Department of Social Security to advise her that she was entitled to it from now on and that payment would be placed into her personal bank account. She was understandably delighted with the news and advised my staff that she would be using the payment to buy shoes and clothing for her family, which she promptly did.

         The news was surprising to my staff, who had done their homework and could not understand how the constituent had received the payment. My staff telephoned the local DSS to find out what had happened. They were advised that the constituent would receive only one payment. The constituent was temporarily eligible because the date of the introduction of the partner allowance and the home child-care allowance had become confused. The home child-care allowance was to be introduced first, but as soon as the partner allowance was introduced she would not be eligible for the HCCA.

         However, the letter which the DSS sent to my constituent did not make this plain. The letter stated she would be receiving the payment `from now on'. Upon further investigation, my staff are not entirely sure whether constituents such as this will even receive official notification from the DSS that their HCCA has ceased. This is something we are still following up. I am unsure of how many constituents the government will lead astray with the legislation. However, I am certain that it will cause a lot of disappointment,

         As I said, this case study comes from my electorate, the seventh poorest electorate in Australia, according to the last census. What can low income Australians expect, with a government which treats them like this? Despite these facts, the government has relentlessly pursued its publicity campaign on the home child-care allowance, mailing information on this allowance to cities in my electorate, while at the same time the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) heralds its so-called benefits in the House. It is clear that we must view with scepticism any move by this government which promises to improve life for many low income Australians.

As part of the planning undertaken for this, the Combined Force Commander, an ADF brigadier, visited Bougainville and spoke with various Bougainville groups on 20-22 September as a member of the reconnaissance team for the peacekeeping operation. Australian involvement with the peacekeeping force will entail deployment of some ADF personnel to Bougainville to provide communications, medical, and other logistic support to the force.

        (5) On 3 September 1994, the PNG Government signed the `Honiara Commitments to Peace on Bougainville', and entered a ceasefire agreement with Bougainville elements on 8 September 1994. Following the ceasefire agreement, PNG Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan has obtained commitments from Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, New Zealand and Australia to deploy a multi-national South Pacific Peacekeeping Force to Bougainville to secure the venue for a Bougainville Peace Conference. Australia's consistent support for a peaceful resolution of the conflict has continued with Australia providing the training and logistic support for the force.

        (6) Australia has a close and longstanding defence relationship with PNG. The assistance Australia provides, and will continue to provide, to PNG as part of that relationship is to develop the PNG Defence Force's overall capacities to fulfil its security functions involving national sovereignty protection (such as fisheries and surveillance), support for internal security (discipline and professionalism of its forces), and assistance to the civil community (including search and rescue, and disaster relief). Such assistance is in the form of training, personnel assistance, and some project assistance, such as the repair or modification of infrastructure. The Defence Cooperation program with PNG is anticipated to remain at the level of approximately $20m over the next five years.

        (1) I noted in my response to the question without notice on 4 May 1994 that Australia has a commendable record on foreign aid. My observation was that "those nations which have a better performance in percentage GDP terms in foreign aid than Australia have much higher percentages of their GDP in the public sector."

        (2) In the last budget the then Minister for Finance Mr Willis announced the sale of a number of government owned assets. Assets to be sold included the Australian National Line but not Australia Post. In deciding to sell certain businesses the government considers that greater efficiency can be obtained from private ownership as well as considering that the provision of such services by the government is no longer necessary. The government does not consider that Australia Post falls into this category and therefore has no intention of selling that company.
