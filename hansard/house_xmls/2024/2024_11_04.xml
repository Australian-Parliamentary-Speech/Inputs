              <span class="HPS-Small">As future jobs require higher education this highlights the urgent need for enhanced Australia's educational infrastructure to meet present and future demands and address the national higher education labour gap. There is a clear demand for advanced educational opportunities to sustain and enhance the community's intellectual capital. Addressing Educational Gaps: Establishing a university specializing in high-demand sectors like Information Technology, Healthcare, Engineering, and Business will address current and future skill gaps in Australia. This institution will boost Australia's skilled workforce and fill national gaps in these essential sectors, ensuring Australia remains competitive in the global economy.</span>

This gap, which reflects the disparity in access to quality education between metropolitan areas and regional, rural, or remote territories, must be closed to ensure that every student, regardless of their location, has equal opportunities for success. By adopting targeted policies and funding programs, we can promote a more inclusive and equitable higher education system that serves all students, regardless of their geographic location.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Domestic violence (DV) is a critical issue affecting countless individuals. However, there are significant challenges in addressing DV cases fairly and effectively. False accusations of DV can devastate innocent lives, leading to unjust legal and social consequences, including wrongful imprisonment. At the same time, inadequate investigation procedures can result in genuine victims not receiving the protection they need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, there is insufficient accountability for those who make false DV claims, and investigative procedures often lack the thoroughness required to ensure justice. Furthermore, many jurors are not fully educated on the fundamental legal principles of "presumption of innocence" and "beyond a reasonable doubt," which are crucial for fair trials.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to Implement Accountability Measures: Introduce legal measures to hold individuals who knowingly make false DV accusations accountable, including clear consequences to deter misuse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Enhance Investigation Procedures: Improve training for law enforcement and investigative personnel to ensure thorough and sensitive handling of DV cases. This includes better evidence collection and victim support practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Educate Jurors: Establish mandatory educational programs for jurors on the principles of presumption of innocence and the standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt" to ensure fair and just trials.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

While Australia aspires to this ideal, our international promises under human rights instruments actually mandate this. For example, Australia's ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), creates a contract, or promise to comply, and an obligation to create multi-directional equality; to act on complaints to state police as if they are without gender, as if Australia is a place without socially constructed bias in policing.</span>

Indeed, Article 2.2 of the ICCPR mandates this. Courts will enforce these rules over state police, if Australia explicitly does this. Australia has a pressing and urgent need to render the administration of all criminal laws, and some civil laws, completely human friendly, and in that universal human rights sense, free of sex and gender bias introduced by gendered, or sexist policy thought and language</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to the 1970's, access to a university education was largely determined by family wealth, rather than merit. That changed in the 1970's when the Whitlam government abolished university fees. In 1989, the Hawke government reintroduced fees but at a level that ensured most working and middle class people with merit could still access university. In 2021 the Morrison government introduced the Job-ready graduates package, which significantly increases the student contribution amount and once again access to a university education largely depended on family wealth for entry to many courses. This proposal is to cap student contributions for CSP's to 10% of the median Australian annual wage.</span>

Her care plan arrangements have collapsed due to her deteriorating condition. The ultimate end game is the appointment of the Public Trustee and the Public advocate to manage her affairs. This will strip her of her financial independence and ultimately force her from her home. This will be partially subsidised by the Australian taxpayer. In addition there are items missing from her home including electrical items and personal identity papers. A serious incident report has been completed but the electrical items and a number of the personal papers remain unaccounted for. There is the possibility of identity fraud and it appears that someone has attempted to obtain access to her bank accounts. Inaction in this matter has resulted in the elderly ladies front door being smashed off its hinges by the state police force. This left her without security for about 8 weeks. This is an unacceptable risk to her safety and security. The risk of this happening again is now ever-present as she lives on her own as her daughters refuse to speak to her or assist her.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We, the undersigned, urge the Australian Parliament to officially recognise and support the global "Women, Life, Freedom" (Jin, Jiyan, Azadi) movement. This powerful slogan, which gained international attention following the tragic death of the young Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini in September 2022 while in the custody of the Iranian morality police, has become a symbol of resistance against the systemic oppression of women in Iran. The movement demands an end to gender-based violence, forced veiling, and the denial of basic human rights. Women in Iran who advocate for their rights face harsh penalties, including imprisonment, torture, and even execution. As Australians with family and connections in Iran, we feel the impact of these injustices and believe that Australia should stand in solidarity with this important cause</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to annually recognise 16th September as "Women, Life, Freedom" Day, also known as "Jin Jiyan Azadi," and formally acknowledge this day in Parliament, recognising our heartache for our families who are enduring gender-based violence. This recognition would serve as a powerful statement of solidarity with the women and families who suffer under oppressive regimes. By acknowledging this day, Australia would join the global community in condemning gender-based violence and supporting the fight for freedom, dignity, and equal rights. It would also reinforce Australia's commitment to human rights and the values of justice and equality for all.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We, the undersigned, urge the House of Representatives to reform federal legislation on child-on-child sexual abuse. Under current law, children aged 10 to 14 are presumed incapable of understanding the criminality of their actions unless proven otherwise (doli incapax). This legal presumption often prioritises the offender's rehabilitation over the victim's rights and welfare. Such an approach inadequately protects victims and fails to hold offenders accountable, leading to long-term psychological harm. Research shows that survivors of childhood sexual abuse are at a significantly higher risk of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicide.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to amend federal laws concerning the age of criminal responsibility, ensuring they better protect victims and hold offenders accountable. We also urge the implementation of federally mandated psychological and emotional support services for victims, to be provided throughout the legal process. Additionally, a comprehensive review of the current legal framework is needed to identify and address gaps that allow offenders to evade serious consequences. These reforms are essential for protecting vulnerable children, ensuring justice, and restoring public confidence in the justice system.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's youth, nearly 5 million strong, are grappling with pressing challenges like the cost of living, mental health issues, and climate change. Yet, many young people feel disconnected from the decision-makers creating policies that profoundly affect our lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To bridge this gap, I propose a "National Youth Meet and Greet Day"—a day dedicated to bringing young Australians face-to-face with community leaders, like MPs and councillors. This initiative would create a welcoming and inclusive space where youth can share their ideas, perspectives, and concerns directly, without the fear of their ideas not being important or valuable enough.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For many young people, reaching out to leaders independently can be intimidating. By establishing this campaign, we provide an opportunity for them to make that initial connection, fostering the confidence to continue dialogues and contribute meaningfully in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I envision this campaign growing into a nationwide movement, engaging leaders at every level, from local to federal government, and giving youth from all walks of life a platform to influence the decisions that affect their future. This day isn't just about a single event—it's about laying the foundation for a future where young Australians are actively involved in shaping the world we live in.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Let's make sure every young person in Australia is heard. Sign the petition, join the campaign, and together, let's create the future all young Australians deserve.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians who are renting are enduring an escalating housing crisis, with rising costs making it increasingly difficult to save for a home deposit, especially for those without the advantage of family wealth to support their future. This creates a vicious cycle where renters are trapped in paying high rents without the ability to invest in their own homes, despite diligently contributing to their superannuation. Currently, Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs) are permitted to purchase commercial properties that can be leased back to the fund owner, providing a clear pathway to financial growth. However, this option is unjustly restricted when it comes to residential properties, preventing Australians from using their superannuation to secure their housing and build long-term financial stability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to allow SMSFs to purchase residential properties for owner-occupancy. This change would enable Australians to redirect the money they currently pay in rent into their superannuation, directly contributing to their wealth growth while securing stable housing. By leveraging their super funds in this way, Australians could break free from the cycle of perpetual renting, build a more secure financial future, and enjoy the stability of knowing their home won't be sold or their lease unexpectedly ended.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed changes to the 485 visa program, effective from 1 July 2024, will prevent current international students in Australia who are 36 years old or older from applying for the 485 visa. This group represents only 5% of the total international student population, but the impact will be significant, causing severe financial and emotional distress to thousands of students. These students, who are already in Australia, have been relying on the 485 work visa as a crucial part of their post-study plans. For many, the visa is essential for completing skill assessments required for migration, obtaining specific licences through Australian work experience, or gaining valuable work experience to use when they return to their home countries. This policy change is seen as age discrimination against international students aged 36 and above, who have also made significant contributions to the Australian economy. The situation is further exacerbated by the recent exemption of Masters Research and PhD students from these changes. Such law amendments not only shatter the dreams and aspirations of those Australia sought to attract but also risk damaging Australia's reputation, making it appear unreliable in fulfilling promises made to international students.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to implement a TRANSITION PERIOD for these new laws. International students who are over 35 years old, who had already arrived in Australia and commenced their courses before the announcement, should still be permitted to apply for the 485 visa up to the age of 50.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Mental health challenges affect millions of Australians each year, leading to significant personal, social, and economic costs. Yet, access to effective psychotherapy remains limited due to capped Medicare funding to 10 sessions per year. Increasing government funding for mental health is essential for several reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">First, untreated mental health issues often escalate into crises that strain healthcare systems, law enforcement, and social services. By investing in preventive and early intervention services, the government can reduce these burdens, leading to better outcomes for individuals and communities while saving public resources in the long run.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Second, the mental health crisis disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, including low-income individuals, minorities, and those living in rural areas. Increased funding would improve access to therapy for these groups, addressing inequalities and ensuring that all citizens have the opportunity to lead healthy, fulfilling lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Expanding access to these services can improve productivity, reduce disability, and enhance the overall well-being of society.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, mental health is as vital as physical health. By prioritizing funding for psychotherapy, the government can demonstrate its commitment to treating mental health with the seriousness it deserves, ultimately leading to a healthier, more resilient population. Investing in mental health is not just a moral imperative; it is a wise economic decision that will pay dividends for generations to come. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We the petitioners, respectively request that medicinal cannabis be added to the PBS. The reasons being that currently it is not affordable to many who would or do benefit from it, and it places an extra financial burden on those struggling to pay for it. It is stated on the Government website (healthdirect.gov.au), that medicinal cannabis can be used to effectively treat epilepsy, chronic pain, insomnia, nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy. This is backed by ongoing research by such institutions as the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence (ACRE). Whilst there may be risks and side effects to the taking of prescribed medicinal cannabis, the same can be said of most health treatments and therapies, e.g. the prescribed use of opioids, which have undesirable side effects, such as nausea, loss of appetite, constipation, drowsiness (also listed on the healthdirect.gov.au website) and are highly addictive.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 7 November 2022, regarding a petition requesting a ban on the installation of mobile phone base stations on any residential or rural residential lots due to health concerns from the community, and proposed amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Industry Code for Mobile Phone Base Station Deployment C564:2020 </span>(the Industry Code). I apologise for the delay in responding. As you may be aware, this petition was not received by my office until 25 August 2023 due to a technical error which then resulted in the petition being incorrectly archived in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (my department) parliamentary document management system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I understand the timeframe for a response to this petition has lapsed, I acknowledge the petitioners concerns and would like to reassure you and the petitioners the effects of electromagnetic energy (EME) exposure are the subject of extensive and rigorous scientific study around the world. The Australian Government strictly regulates EME emissions to protect the health and safety of all members of the public, while allowing the community to access essential modem telecommunications services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) is an independent Government agency that is not affiliated with, or unduly influenced by, the telecommunications industry and provides advice on radiation protection to the Australian Government, including both the Department of Health and my department.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2021, ARPANSA updated its <span style="font-style:italic;">Radiation Protection Series (RPS) Standard for Limiting Exposure to Radiofrequency Fields</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">100 kHz to 300 GHz </span>(RPS S -1), also known as the 'ARPANSA RF Standard', based on the most up-to-date Australian and international peer- reviewed research into EME. The exposure limits are based on current scientific knowledge, are aligned with international guidelines prepared by the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and are endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">They are underpinned by several reviews of the scientific literature including: the ICNIRP review of RF EME and health, and The Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)'s opinion on 'Potential health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF)'. The RF Standard covers the operating frequencies of 5G infrastructure and devices. ARPANSA consulted publicly in developing its new RF Standard and provided extensive information explaining the changes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the petitioners' concerns about 4G and 5G, there is currently no substantiated scientific evidence that exposure to radio waves from this technology at levels below the exposure limits set in the ARPANSA RF Standard causes any adverse health effects. The ARPANSA RF Standard protects people of all ages and health status against all known adverse health effects from exposure to EME by specifying emission levels that telecommunications services must operate below. The limits are set much lower than the levels where known health effects occur. Because of this requirement, there is no particular advantage in requiring telecommunications infrastructure to be located any particular distance from residential areas or community sensitive locations, such as schools. Further information about the steps taken by ARPANSA in developing its RF Standard are set out on its website at www.arpansa.gov.au/developing-arpansas-radiofrequency-safety-standard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the ACMA) is an independent Commonwealth statutory authority and sets rules for the communications industry to follow based on the ARPANSA RF Standard. These rules maintain EME at safe levels and the ACMA actively monitors compliance with these rules. More information about this regulation is available at www.acma.gov.au/our-rules-eme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petitioners may also be interested to know the ACMA is auditing EME emissions from a selected sample of representative sites across Australia, and have compared results against the safety limit specified in the ARPANSA RF Standard. The ACMA's measurements have, to date, found all sites tested are well below the safety limit specified in the ARPANSA RF Standard. Further information is available at www.acma.gov.au/publications/2022-08/guide/eme-checker.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The following information may be useful for petitioners with concerns relating to consultation requirements for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure in communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government expects carriers to engage with communities in a meaningful and sensitive way about proposed deployments and is responsible for the carriers' powers and immunities {P&amp;I) framework, established under Schedule 3 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications Act 1997</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>(the Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The P&amp;I framework provides that carriers can install 'low-impact facilities' such as antennas and cabling, without the need for planning approvals. This framework has been in place for more than 20 years and has enabled the rollout of mobile networks and the National Broadband Network in an efficient, nationally consistent way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Larger telecommunications infrastructure, such as towers and poles, cannot be deployed by a carrier using the P&amp;I framework, and must be installed in accordance with local State or Territory planning laws. The Commonwealth is not involved in local or state and territory government planning processes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Industry Code sets out processes that mobile carriers should follow when installing low-impact facilities and other infrastructure that does not require development approval. The Industry Code is designed to ensure that stakeholders are advised before a mobile phone base station is constructed, and that council and community views are considered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Information about proposed and current telecommunications facilities is available on the Radio Frequency National Site Archive (RFNSA), which is available for public access at www.rfnsa.com.au. This website is managed by the telecommunications industry. Interested parties can subscribe to receive information about future installations of telecommunications equipment at a particular site or area.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any complaints about a carrier's compliance with its obligations under the Act can be made to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) on 1300 850 115 or by email to info@acma.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note my department provides information on its website about the P&amp;I framework and deployment of telecommunications equipment, and the research, regulation and safety of EME from telecommunications. The information is available at www.infrastructure.1wv.au/powers-and-immunities and www.eme.srov.au respectively.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to Senator the Hon Penny Wong, Minister for Foreign Affairs, regarding Petition EN4321 requesting the Government to address issues of Uyghur forced labour by passing the Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced By Uyghur Forced Labour) Bill 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced By Uyghur Forced Labour) Bill 2020 proposed to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Act 1901 </span>to prohibit the importation into Australia of goods from Xinjiang province in the People's Republic of China as well as goods from other parts of China that are produced by using forced labour. The Bill was introduced to the Australian Parliament on 8 December 2020 and was discharged from the Notice Paper on 24 June 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government considers forced labour and other forms of modem slavery, no matter where they occur, to be abhorrent crimes that have no place in our society.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Modem slavery is a serious issue and the Government is delivering on its commitment to strengthen its already comprehensive response to modem slavery at home and abroad.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to have grave concerns about severe human rights violations in Xinjiang, including forced labour. The Prime Minister raised these concerns directly with China's Premier Li Qiang on 17 June 2024. The Government will continue to work with partners to urge China to adhere to its human rights obligations through multilateral forums. Australia made a number of strong recommendations to China during its Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review in January 2024, including to cease coercive labour practices which discriminate against Uyghurs on the basis of race or religion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also committed to strengthening our domestic framework to ensure the supply chains Australians use do not promote, condone or financially support forced labour, including by strengthening the <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Slavery Act 2018 </span>(the Act). On 28 May 2024, the Australian Parliament passed legislation to establish Australia's inaugural federal Anti-Slavery Commissioner (Commissioner) with critical core functions. The Government has committed $8 million over four years, and $2 million each year thereafter to establish the role of the Commissioner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner will work across Government, industry and civil society to exercise their functions, including to:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">help fight modern slavery in Australia and abroad.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner will be a new, independent pillar of Australia's response to modem slavery and will complement Australia's existing efforts across Government, industry and civil society to combat this crime.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act has increased business and government awareness of modem slavery risks, including forced labour. The Act requires certain large entities to report annually and describe the risks of modem slavery in their global operations and supply chains, and any actions taken to address these risks. The Government provides support and guidance to businesses to help them report in accordance with the Act. The Government will soon respond to the statutory review of the Act in 2024 following careful consideration of the recommendations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also conducts outreach to businesses on supply chain risks, including forced labour, and the importance of due diligence in relation to addressing modem slavery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of the work underway internationally to prevent goods produced using forced labour from entering markets. Cross-border mechanisms entail significant practical, administration and enforcement challenges that need careful and thorough consideration. The Government may consider ways to further strengthen Australia's response to forced labour in supply chains in line with its response to the review of the Act and in consultation with the Commissioner, once appointed.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your referral of 25 July 2023 of a petition regarding geoengineering (EN4343). I regret the time it has taken to respond.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of geoengineering concerns, their association with 'chemtrails' and their prevalence on internet websites. These theories often suggest that the trails seen behind high level aircraft are the result of the deliberate spraying of chemical or biological agents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The observed phenomenon is actually caused by condensation trails or 'contrails' produced by high level aircraft. These contrails, or long streams of cloud, are formed when hot engine exhaust containing water vapor, carbon dioxide, and small amounts of particles, mixes with cold surrounding air. Under the right conditions contrails can last for hours while growing to several kilometres in width and 200 to 400 metres in height. There is no evidence that contrails are harmful to human health or the environment, although they can lead to increased cloud formation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additional information about contrails and other emissions from an aircraft and their impact on the environment and climate is available from the US Environmental Protection Agency website at epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-10/documents/afd-051013-001.pdf and the Air Services Australia website at www.airservicesaustralia.com/about-us/about-our-operations/condensation-trails.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, the Government has also recently passed legislation to establish Writing Australia as a new part of Creative Australia to provide direct support to the literature sector, including for writers and publishers. With $26 million funding over three years, Writing Australia will grow local and international audiences for Australian books and will establish a National Poet Laureate. This funding is in addition to the existing support for the literature sector provided by Creative Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 August 2024, on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning Petition EN5342, regarding the protection of genetic information and the regulation of commercial DNA and ancestry testing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the concerns around the use of genetic information provided for DNA testing. It is vital that Australia's privacy laws properly protect our personal information, and that they keep pace with technological developments and global standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>(Privacy Act) protects the privacy of Australians by regulating the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information. It contains the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which apply to Australian Government agencies and private sector organisations with an annual turnover of over $3 million. In 2006, the Privacy Act was amended to safeguard the handling of genetic information by changing the definition of 'health information' and 'sensitive information' to expressly include genetic information. The Privacy Act applies to businesses incorporated in Australia, and businesses outside Australia where they carry on a business in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the APPs, an entity can only use or disclose personal information (which includes health information and sensitive information) for a purpose for which it was collected (known as the 'primary purpose'), or for a secondary purpose if an exception applies (APP 6). Entities must take reasonable steps to protect personal information that they hold from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure (APP 11), and, before disclosing personal information to an overseas recipient, must take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the APPs in relation to the information (APP 8). More information on individuals' privacy rights, as well as information on how to make a privacy compliant, is available on the website of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), Australia's privacy regulator, at: https://www.oaic.gov.au/.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to strengthening existing privacy protections. The Attorney-General's Department's comprehensive review of the Privacy Act was released in February 2023. The report, available online at www.ag.gov.au/rights-and- protections/publications/privacy-act-review-report, made a number of reform proposals, including to require entities to handle personal information fairly and reasonably, to enhance notice and consent requirements, and to provide a right for individuals to request that their personal information be erased.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This review included a proposal to amend the Privacy Act to require entities to handle personal information fairly and reasonably, entities would be required to handle personal information in a way in which Australians reasonably expect. This test would apply regardless of whether an individual has indicated their consent, meaning entities would not be able to use consent as a shield for inappropriate privacy practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This test would set a baseline of protections to give Australians confidence should they choose to provide their data to commercial DNA and ancestry testing entities.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's Response to the review, published in September 2023 and available online at www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/government-response-privacy- act-review-report. agreed or agreed in-principle to progress the vast majority of proposals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 12 September 2024, I introduced the Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024 into Parliament. The Bill would legislate a first tranche of proposals agreed to in the Government Response to the review, as well as introduce a statutory t01t for serious invasions of privacy, and criminal offences for the malicious release of an individual's personal data online, also known as doxxing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring the Privacy Act works for all Australians and is fit for purpose in the digital age. This legislation is just the first stage of the Government's commitment to provide individuals with greater control over their personal information. The Government will continue to advance proposals that it agreed in principle to progress in its Response to the review, through targeted consultation with stakeholders on draft provisions. This targeted consultation will inform the Government's decisions on next steps and a future package of reforms.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your petition of 12 February 2024 requesting truth in political advertising legislation be implemented for elections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to strengthening the transparency of our electoral system and maintaining voter confidence in elections. Electoral reform is complex and requires consultation across the Parliament. As such, the parliament's multi-partisan Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) is the appropriate forum for proposed electoral changes to be investigated and considered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">After JSCEM was constituted for this parliament, I requested its consideration of matters relating to the 2022 federal election. One of the issues I specifically asked for inquiry into was the potential for 'truth in political advertising' laws to enhance the integrity and transparency of the electoral system. In its interim report, JSCEM recommended the Government legislate to govern truth in political advertising.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is carefully considering these recommendations and is pursuing multi- partisan support for legislative reform to strengthen our electoral system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention. Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5967 on businesses and banks becoming cashless.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands the important role cash still plays in our payments system and supports Australians having continued access to cash.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The use of cash as a method of payment has been declining for many years due to changing consumer preferences and advances in technology. This long-nm trend has been reinforced by changes in payment behaviour arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Nonetheless, cash is an important payment method for certain groups and plays a vital role in their inclusion in the wider economy. Cash is still widely accepted as a means of payment by merchants, used as a store of value, and provides resilience to the payments system during outages where digital forms of money cannot be used.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 June 2023, the Government released its Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System (the Plan), which details the policy priorities and objectives of the Government in relation to payments. One of the initiatives in the Plan was 'Maintaining adequate access to cash'. As part of this, the Government will work with relevant agencies across the public sector and with industry to ensure that Australia has a sustainable cash distribution network that maintains adequate access to cash. The Plan is available online at www.treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-06/p2023-404960.pdf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Cash, however, is not always the best means of payment for a business to accept and can add to their costs. This is a commercial decision for businesses who are able to specify what forms of payment they will accept prior to entering into a transaction. While these are commercial decisions, the Government is monitoring the situation to ensure vulnerable Australians are able to access the essential goods and services they need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your referral of 14 May 2024 regarding the House of Representatives Petition EN5997—Ban Elbit Systems from Australian Government Contracts. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia remains gravely concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. We continue to press for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians and for hostages to be released immediately. The Government has committed more than $72 million for humanitarian assistance to the Middle East since 7 October 2023 and continues to call for safe, unimpeded and sustained access for humanitarian workers. We have made clear that international law must be observed in all contexts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, I addressed the House on 6 June 2024, and advised there is significant misinformation concerning the contracting arrangements for the LAND 400 Phase 3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle program. Hanwha Defence Australia (Hanwha) was selected by the Australian Government to build and deliver the Redback Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Australian Defence Force (ADF). This program will deliver critical capability to the ADF and support local Australian jobs, and manufacturing in our defence industry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Hanwha has made a commercial decision to sub-contract work associated with the turret system to Elbit Systems. The Australian Government has no direct relationship with Elbit Systems with respect to this contract. Moreover, the components manufactured under this contract are solely for Australian needs, not for export elsewhere.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has not supplied weapons to Israel since the conflict began, and for at least the past five years. Australia has a stringent export control framework, which is designed to ensure our military and dual-use items are used responsibly outside Australia. Defence undertakes a rigorous assessment of each application against a range of legislated criteria, including with respect to Australia's human rights and international obligations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Like more than 160 countries, Australia continues to maintain a bilateral relationship with Israel. This involves maintaining our bilateral economic, trade and investment ties.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for your referral of the petition, and I trust this information is of assistance. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 June 2024 regarding a petition (reference EN6118) to increase penalties for child sex offenders and consider legalising the death penalty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands that for those who have lived experience of child sexual abuse, speaking out takes bravery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, the petition calls for increased severity of sentencing for child sexual abuse offences. For child sexual abuse offences that are held by the states and territories, the federal government is unable to prescribe the severity of penalties for these offences. Where child sexual abuse offences are considered Commonwealth-level offences, the Australian Government continues to work with the criminal justice system to ensure it is equipped to independently deliver the most appropriate penalties in these cases. On 13 March 2024, the High Court handed down judgment that confirmed that mandatory minimum sentencing provisions under sections 16AAA, 16AAB, and 16AAC of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Crimes Act 1914 </span>will apply for Commonwealth child sexual abuse offences, and will operate as yardsticks for the appropriate te1m of imprisonment for the offence in the least serious circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, the petition calls for a national debate to legalise the death penalty and apply it to these offence types. The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that serious crimes are met with appropriate penalties, but has a long-standing policy of opposition to capital punishment. As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Second Optional Protocol, Australia has an obligation not only to abolish the death penalty in its jurisdiction, but also to ensure that our laws and policies are consistent with this obligation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In March 2010, the Commonwealth Parliament passed laws to extend the application of the prohibition on the death penalty to the States and Territories. This ensures that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government, however, is committed to ensuring that victims and survivors of child sexual abuse are supported and empowered. The Government has a commitment to measures that reduce, and ultimately end, the prevalence of child sexual abuse offences in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Child Sexual Abuse 2021-2030, </span>a number of initiatives are underway across a variety of areas, including under the themes of 'offender prevention and intervention' and 'supporting and empowering victims and survivors' amongst others.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this info1mation is of assistance. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 3 June 2024 regarding petition number EN6121 regarding removing net zero targets and reconsidering approaches to environmental sustainability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Governments and communities around the world recognise the challenge and risks of climate change and are acting to transform their economic activities and reduce emissions. These actions are formalised in the Paris Agreement, to which Australia is a party. The only United Nations members not yet a party to the Paris Agreement are Iran, Libya and Yemen (each of which has signed, but not yet ratified). More than 160 countries, including the world's largest economies—China, the United States, India and the European Union—have net-zero targets, covering about 89 per cent of global emissions and 94 per cent of global GDP.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2022, the Parliament legislated Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, to reach net zero by 2050 and to reduce emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Building on that momentum, the Government has committed to developing a Net Zero Plan and six sectoral decarbonisation plans which will articulate how Australia will transition to a net zero economy, consistent with our international and domestic commitments. Investors, industry, unions and other stakeholders have called for a clear and credible net zero plan with sectoral detail and welcomed the Government's sectoral planning approach. Government has a key role to set clear direction and provide a stable policy framework for Australia's transition to net zero.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By setting and working to achieve targets, Australia is participating in the most significant structural change in the world economy since the industrial revolution. If we are to continue to participate in the global economy and remain relevant and competitive, Australia must continue to take strong and credible action to reduce our emissions. The Government's Future Made in Australia policy framework will help us become a renewable energy superpower and an indispensable part of the global economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's net zero targets, enabling legislation and supporting policies introduced by this Government are already achieving real emissions reductions. The most recent National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Quarterly Update shows emissions in the year to March 2024 were 28.2 per cent below emissions in 2005. And our emissions projections indicate committed policies put us on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 42 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030—well within reach of our legislative target.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decarbonising the transport sector is a critical step in reducing whole of economy emissions. The Australian Government recognises the importance of public electric vehicle charging infrastructure in our transition to decarbonise the transport sector. At the end of 2023, there were around 800 ultra-DC fast charging locations operating nationwide, supporting 2,000 fast and ultra-fast charging plugs-an increase of over 70 per cent in a year. Over the next 12-36 months, an additional 1,000 new fast charging locations are expected to be opened across the country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this investment, the National Electric Vehicle Fast Charging Network is being delivered by the National Roads and Motorists' Association (NRMA) with a $39.3 million grant from the Government to deliver 117 public fast charging stations along key highway routes across Australia, at an average interval of 150 km.</span>
            </p>

This framework reaffirms the UNSC's strong concern about the security situation in Afghanistan, in particular the potential for Afghanistan to be used as a base for cross-border tenorist activities.

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Amateur Radio Licences</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 1 July 2024 on behalf of 1342 signatories regarding Petition EN6254, which requests that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is directed to restore the practice of issuing an appropriate and acceptable validation document to authorised Australian amateur radio operators.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise the importance of amateur radio operators being able to appropriately demonstrate that they can operate an amateur radio station and call sign both in Australia and overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACMA is the statutory authority with responsibility for regulating radiocommunications services in Australia. This includes responsibility for regulating and licensing use of the radiofrequency spectrum by amateur radio operators. On 19 February 2024, the new <span style="font-style:italic;">Radiocommunications (Amateur Stations) Class Licence </span>2023 (class licence) commenced to replace the previous non-assigned apparatus licensing arrangement for amateur radio operators (amateurs). The class licence was introduced after extensive consultation with the amateur radio community to reduce the cost, complexity and regulatory burden of the previous non-assigned apparatus licence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The previous non-assigned apparatus licensing arrangements required the ACMA to issue a licence document to individual amateurs for a fee. The new class licence no longer requires the issue or renewal of a licence or payment of a licence fee. After the implementation of the class licence, amateurs previously holding an apparatus licence could continue to operate under the class licence if they had a recognised qualification and a call sign.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To manage the transition between the two licensing arrangements, the ACMA issued a 'Letter of Confirmation' to all non-assigned amateur apparatus licensees prior to the introduction of the class licence. This letter provided details on the transition, implications for licensing, as well as the highest qualification level and any 2, 3 or 4-letter call signs assigned to the individual amateur.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACMA obtained agreement from the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), and its member states, that the Letter of Confirmation could be used as proof that amateurs can continue to operate under the class licence, with reciprocal licensing arrangements updated accordingly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When the ACMA assigns a call sign after 19 February 2024 under the class licensing framework, the ACMA provides a call sign ce1tificate to the amateur. The Petitioners raise a concern about the ACMA declining to issue a call sign certificate to amateurs who formerly held an apparatus licence, which the Petitioners consider would be a suitable replacement for the now withdrawn apparatus licence document. The Petition suggests that the Letter of Confirmation has been shown to be inadequate in both content and appearance for validation purposes, and does not adequately confirm that a valid licence or call sign is currently held by the amateur.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACMA has advised that the Letter of Confirmation, which is also recognised by the CEPT and its member states under reciprocal licencing arrangements, is sufficient for amateurs to appropriately demonstrate that they can continue to operate under the class licence. Further, the issue of an additional call sign certificate is likely to introduce confusion about how amateurs can demonstrate that they can operate under the class licence, and would be contrary to the purpose of the class licence to reduce regulatory burden and simplify the regulatory framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While it is acknowledged that the new class licence arrangement has resulted in a change of practice for some amateurs and stakeholders, the ACMA continues to engage individually with amateurs, other regulators, and organisations that provide services to amateurs, to answer any questions about the new class licence arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to write to me on this matter. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 August 2024 which referred the petition to introduce Castle Law in Australia under Standing Orders 209(a) and (b).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring the safety of all Australians. Under Australia's federal system, the Commonwealth, states and territories have different responsibilities with respect to criminal law. The proposal in the petition for expanded self-defence laws is most likely to engage state or territory laws such as crimes against the person (e.g. assault, aggravated assault or murder) or property (e.g. robbery, theft, trespass). These are appropriately a matter for the states and territories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 10.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code provides for the defence of self-defence as it applies in relation to Commonwealth criminal offences. Section 10.4 balances a person's right to defend themselves with force, where required, in the circumstances set out under subsection 10.4(2), whilst requiring that any response is reasonable in the circumstances. Self-defence does not apply where force is used to intentionally inflict death or really serious injury to protect property, prevent criminal trespass or remove a person who was committing criminal trespass.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is not proposing to extend the self-defence provisions in the Criminal Code.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 12 August 2024, concerning Petition EN6309—ban or heavily restrict the use of Metaldehyde in snail and slug pellets for sale in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The approval of agricultural chemical products for sale in Australia is regulated by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). The APVMA undertakes risk assessments based on the scientific analysis of information and data relating to an agricultural chemical, such as metaldehyde, to determine how toxic a chemical or product is to humans, plants and animals in the environment, and the extent to which people, plants or animals are likely to be exposed to the chemical when it is used according to the label. When a product is approved, label instructions which set out how the product must be used to be safe are also approved.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">APVMA approved labels for metaldehyde snail and slug baits include a statement to keep the product away from domestic pets, specifically dogs, and require that the product be scattered, not heaped. Scattering of baits is required to reduce the attractiveness to animals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Off-label use (where a chemical is not used according to the approved product label) is an offence and should be referred to the state and territory control-of-use authorities. A list of the relevant control-of-use authorities is available on the APVMA website at https:/ /www.apvma.gov.au/about/use-agvet-chemicals-australia</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where new information indicates that the use according to label directions is not safe, the APVMA can reconsider the ongoing approval. Anyone can nominate an active constituent, registered product or approved label for reconsideration and provide evidence to support their claim. Nominations are considered on a scientific basis. More information on this process can be found at: https:/Jwww.apvma.gov.au/regulation/chemical-review/chemical-review-process/reconsideration-process</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Once again, thank you for taking the time to write to me. I hope the information provided is of assistance to you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 August 2024 about petition EN6350 concerning per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water supplies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to considering the best available scientific evidence when setting policy and standards. Whilst drinking water monitoring is the statutory responsibility of the various water supply utilities in the states and territories, the Government works closely with states and territories to ensure Australians have clean and safe drinking water. At the national level, the health-based guideline values for PFAS in the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, set by the National Health and _Medical Research Council (NHMRC), are based on the best available scientific evidence for the Australian context and are considered protective of public health. In addition, Food Standards Australia New Zealand has undertaken comprehensive monitoring of PFAS in the general food supply, including tap and packaged water as part of the Australian Total Diet Study, and found no concerns for consumers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Health and Aged Care is currently working with the NHMRC to progress an independent review of the Australian health-based guideline values for PFAS in the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. The review includes examining recent international PFAS guidance and reviews, such as the recommendations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, to determine if the current Australian advice remains appropriate. The review will include public consultation on the draft guidelines, expected to commence in October this year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A Senate Select Committee on PFAS has also been established to inquire into the extent, regulation and management of PFAS in Australia. The work of the committee includes investigating areas for reform, including legislative, regulatory, public health and other policy measures. The committee is due to report on or before 5 August 2025.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 August 2024 regarding Petition EN6353, which calls for the continuation of the exemption for cruise vessels under Section 11 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012 </span>(the Act) for at least five more years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to continuing to support and enhance our maritime sector, including the cruise industry, and I recently announced the commencement of a review of the Act. The review will consider a range of issues, including whether the treatment of passenger movements and vessels support Australian tourism and the domestic cruise industry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In order to support and provide certainty to the cruise tourism industry in Australia, I have continued the current exemption for cruise vessels until 31 December 2026, while the review of the Act is undertaken. The exemption will continue to apply to vessels in excess of 5,000 gross tonnes which are capable of a speed of at least 15 knots and carrying at least 100 passengers (utilised wholly or primarily for the carriage of passengers between any ports in the Commonwealth or in the Territories, except between Victoria and Tasmania).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the Petition requests an extension of the Exemption for five years. However, I considered an extension for a further two years will allow sufficient time for the review of the Act to be completed, and the implementation of any recommendations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Therapeutic Goods Administration</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 August 2024 regarding petition number EN6367 relating to the legislative change to remove medicines containing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) from the pharmacist compounding exemption. I understand that the petition requests compounded GLP-1 RA products to be supplied to patients through a special accreditation pathway, facilitated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration {TGA), as part of the Department of Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has secured new regulation amendments to remove GLP-1 RAs from the pharmacy compounding exemption from 1 October 2024. The concern regarding the compounding of GLP-1 RAs is that of public safety, primarily due to the potential impact of commercial-scale manufacturing of unregulated products. The practice of large-scale manufacturing is beyond the current exemptions applied to compounded medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pharmacy compounding is intended only for small quantities, for an individual patient who has a prescription, where a commercially manufactured medicine is either not suitable or not clinically appropriate. Compounded medicines are not listed or registered, and no assessment of quality, stability or efficacy of the final medicinal product is required prior to the supply to the patient. That is, compounded medicines are not regulated in the same way that large-scale manufactured prescription medicines are. The large-scale manufacturing of medicines through compounding means that these products are being provided in large quantities, without the regulation and evaluation that such volumes should undergo. The TGA has a role to evaluate and facilitate access to appropriate treatments. However, when the risks outweigh the benefit of access, it recommends the appropriate regulatory actions to be taken.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has concerns that the proposed accreditation system outlined in the petition will not address the risks and concerns relating to public safety in the large-scale manufacturing and dispensing of compounded GLPl-RAs. Specifically, the proposed accreditation scheme is not in line with the current legislative exemptions for compounding medicines (i.e. small volumes of drug specifically compounded for an individual patient need) and does not align with the TGA's current Good Manufacturing Practice licensing processes for manufacturers of registered products, including both new medicines and generic branded medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While it is recognised that shortages cause significant anxiety for patients, alternative treatments accessed during these situations must still be safe and of good quality. The TGA is working hard to improve the shortage situation of Ozempic (semaglutide) and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) as quickly and effectively as possible. As part of this, the TGA has been regularly liaising with the sponsors of Ozempic and Mounjaro, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly respectively. Recently, the TGA has been advised by Novo Nordisk that new semaglutide product, Wegovy has now become available in the Australian market. While Wegovy and Ozempic contain the same active ingredient, the approved indications (circumstances for use) are different. Further information is available at <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">www.tga.gov.au/safety/shortages/medicine-shortage-alerts/new-semaglutide-product-becomes-available</span>. The TGA will continue to monitor the supply of GLP-1 RAs in coming months and update the advice on their webpages as required.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that compounded GLP-1 RA products supplied through compounding pharmacies are not identical to the TGA-approved products Ozempic or Mounjaro. For a medicine, such as Ozempic®, to be registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, the sponsor must lodge an application to the TGA supported by the necessary evidence to establish the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine for the requested use. This information, submitted to the TGA by the sponsor, would typically include data from well-conducted clinical trials in addition to other information such as information on manufacturing processes, toxicology and chemistry data. Once registered, medicines are also subject to rigorous post-market monitoring, including for adverse events experienced by patients. These regulatory controls are crucial to provide the community and health professionals with confidence of the safety of medicines they access or prescribe. This process provides the public with assurances that their medicines meet the expected standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The legislative change to commence from 1 October 2024 is intended to provide assurance to the public that there are measures in place to ensure medicines containing GLP-1 RA products prescribed to Australian patients are of appropriate quality, safety and efficacy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 15 August 2024 regarding Petition EN6369, which calls for legislation mandating rotating beacons and side lighting on rolling stock to improve level crossing safety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All Australian governments are working towards the goal of zero harm at level crossings. In June 2023, infrastructure and transport ministers asked the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR) to develop a Train Visibility Code of Practice (the Code). The Code is the first of its kind and is expected to improve level crossing safety across the country, particularly in regional Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Infrastructure and transport ministers made the unprecedented decision to introduce a voluntary Code to fast-track level crossing safety benefits for the community. This approach received support from governments, industry and the ONRSR. Mandating the Code at this point in time would result in long delays before we see any industry-wide train visibility improvements. However, infrastructure and transport ministers will be closely monitoring the Code's effectiveness and have not discounted taking further action in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the current Code is voluntary, section 250 of <span style="font-style:italic;">the Rail Safety National Law 2012 </span>(RSNL), enables a code of practice to be used as evidence in proceedings by rail operators and managers to discharge their safety obligations under the RSNL. A code of practice carries more weight with courts when considering whether an operator has fulfilled their general safety duties. This will provide a substantial incentive for rail operators to apply the Code in line with their particular risk profile.</span>

We are exploring opportunities to provide more information to the Australian community, including thinking about how this information can best be reported on our website on a regular basis without disclosing information that falls within the definition of "confidential commercial information" (CCI) under section 3 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Ad 1994 </span>(Agvet Code).</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  As usual, the petitions being presented today cover a wide range of topics, and this reflects the variety of issues that concern citizens and residents of Australia. Some of the subjects in today's petitions are keeping a post office open, rural health care, the AUKUS agreement and federal laws relating to the age of criminal responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaker, as you're aware, the Petitions Committee assesses each petition to ensure it complies with the standing orders. There are a number of requirements for petitions, but today I'd like to highlight two that I have spoken about previously. Firstly, a petition must refer to a matter on which the House can act. This usually means something for which the federal government is responsible. Petitions requesting action on matters that are dealt with by state or territory governments or local councils should be directed to those jurisdictions. In many cases, when a petition to the House is ruled out of order on this basis, the committee advises the petitioner of where they could redirect their petition. However, it's a shame to see requests for action delayed for this reason.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I remind petitioners that language used in a petition must be moderate. I acknowledge that many petitions relate to grievances and that the experience of writing a petition may be challenging or stressful. Even so, the language used needs to be considered moderate by the committee. The committee does not accept petitions that contain derogatory, offensive or abusive language. In line with the requirements of the House, petitions may not contain insults to members of parliament, the judiciary or the Governor-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, petitions should not use language that discloses personal information about a private individual. The committee usually rules out of order petitions that are about someone who is not the principal petitioner or not already a public figure. Language evolves over time, and the Petitions Committee also has some discretion over how it applies the requirement for moderate language in petitions. In essence, though, the terms of a petition should be respectful and based on reasoned argument. I thank the House.</span>

Given that the current Parliamentary Budget Officer, Dr Stein Helgeby, will not be seeking another term, the President of the Senate and I, in consultation with the Australian Public Service Commissioner, commenced a merit based recruitment process to fill the vacancy. I'm pleased to inform the House that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has approved the appointment of Ms Sam Reinhardt as the Parliamentary Budget Officer. Her term will begin on 18 November 2024. On behalf of all members, I congratulate Sam on her appointment, and I'm sure members will join me in thanking Dr Helgeby for his service.</span>

She is incredibly appropriate and has all the prerequisites required for the position. We went through a process to make sure that the appointment was done appropriately. Of course the Parliamentary Budget Officer is a very important role. In many ways it's an apolitical role to make sure the commitments of the government, the opposition and other parties make in relation to elections is looked at impartially, and I'm sure the new Parliamentary Budget Officer will do that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I present the following reports: Report 505: <span style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry </span><span style="font-style:italic;">into </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Policy </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Program Design and Implementation</span>; and Report 506: <span style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry </span><span style="font-style:italic;">into Commonwealth </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Statements </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2022</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">23</span>. Policy and program design and implementation is an area that requires continuous improvement. The delivery great policy model introduced in 2019 by government states that policy advice should be clear on intent, well-informed, practical to implement and influential. There is an expectation that government entities will adopt these practices but the inquiry found this is not always the case. The reports of the Auditor-General that were examined in this inquiry highlighted inadequate stakeholder engagement, a lack of effective performance measures and deficiencies in the advice to government among their findings. Ineffective decision-making and departure from best practice resulted in common issues being identified by the ANAO even though the audited programs were very different and included the export control legislative framework, telehealth expansion, family migration and the black economy task force. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Delivering Great Policy model outlines the need for policymakers to be well informed and for active stakeholder consultation. Some of the audited agencies only did this at an executive level and thus excluded the views of some of the most impacted parties for consideration. On several occasions throughout this inquiry examples were provided to the committee of poor information management and lack of coordination between agencies and inadequate communication to stakeholders. Further issues included inadequate support resulting in ineffective implementation and the need for additional resources to correct this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also learned of instances where critical deficiencies in the advice to government created additional strain in the delivery of the relevant programs and policies. The telehealth services expansion by Department of Health and Aged Care during COVID-19 yielded some valuable lessons for providing such advice if a global pandemic were to rise again in the future. The committee found that deficient advice by the Department of Home Affairs regarding the Family Migration program and by the Treasury when implementing the Black Economy Taskforce negatively impacted public trust in the effectiveness and transparency of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Performance reporting and impact measurement are also fundamental components of effective policy and program design and implementation. They provide evidence based data that enable adjustments and improvements by policymakers that can ultimately determine whether the intended outcome has been achieved. A lack of importance placed on these activities was found, in three audit reports, to cause avoidable delays and inefficiencies. Crucial information to assist with decision-making and future planning was also, therefore, lacking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to note that the Commonwealth entities involved in this inquiry provided substantial responses to their audit findings and that they assisted the committee's investigation on the core practices that required future improvement. The committee has noted that there was still work to be done in relation to several of the programs resulting from the findings of the Auditor-General's report. We have made 11 recommendations to this report, which include requests for progress updates from Home Affairs on its stakeholder engagement and planning, from agriculture on it's transformation and action plan, from health on legislative changes to allow digital assignment of benefits for the MBS, from Treasury on strengthening its information management processes and from the Department of Education on its performance and stakeholder engagement plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also recommended that the Australian government prioritise legislation to align the Health Insurance Act with the modern technological requirements of telehealth and makes further reforms to make the partner and child family visa program truly demand driven. This inquiry has highlighted that Commonwealth entities must remain vigilant in ensuring that they continue to meet best practice requirements when designing and implementing policies and programs for the benefit of the Australian public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now move to <span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport 506</span>. The second of the reports I am presenting today concerns JCPAA's inquiry into the Commonwealth financial statements audit 2022-23. The annual auditing of the financial accounting and reporting by Commonwealth entities by the ANAO provides assurance to the parliament on the financial position of the Australian government and the expenditure of taxpayers' money. The financial statements audit of 243 separate entities in 2022-23 also provided a crucial assessment of the risk, governance arrangements and internal control frameworks that exist across the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the significant and moderate findings in these audits were in the categories of governance of legal and other matters impacting entity financial statements; IT governance including security, change management and user access; and accounting and control of non-financial assets. The ANAO report also noted that there were increased weaknesses compared to last year in change management policies and control of IT systems and in the process used by entities for accounting for computer software.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a number of areas of concern for the committee that arose during the inquiry. One was the 14 legislative breaches identified by the audits, three of which were significant and involved two instances of payments and one where no legally required system of risk oversight was in place. Seven of the non-significant legislative breaches involved incorrect executive remuneration and noncompliance with the Remuneration Tribunal. The committee agrees with the acting Auditor-General, in relation to this issue, that executive remuneration issues have important implications both for the prevailing culture of an agency and for public expectations regarding pay and entitlements of public servants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first two recommendations of this report require the three entities with the significant legislative breaches to update the committee on their progress in addressing them. The committee has also recommended that the Department of Finance amend its guidelines to require immediate notification of any remuneration breaches and subsequent engagements with the entity in question to discuss remediation steps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Problems with the timeliness of financial statements preparation by some entities were also of concern to the committee during the inquiry. While there was an increase over the previous year in these statements being finalised and the Auditor's report being issued within three months of the financial year end, the number of entities tabling their annual report in time to be scrutinised at subsequent Senate estimates hearings declined over the previous year. The committee's view is that the parliament must have this information in time to readily and properly scrutinise the expenditure of taxpayers' funds. A third recommendation from this inquiry was that entities that have failed to table their annual reports on time for three consecutive years must provide an explanation to the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee was also interested in the role that internal auditors play in assisting Commonwealth entities with the timeliness and robustness of their financial reporting. An internal audit function is currently not mandatory, and the committee concurs with the view of the ANAO that this is puzzling, given the well-established benefits for risk management, fraud control and legislative compliance. It was concerning to us, therefore, that approximately 20 per cent of entities have reduced their internal audit budgets over the past years. The committee notes and appreciates that the Department of Finance has commenced a consultation process to update and enhance its guidance of internal auditing. The fourth recommendation of the committee in this report is that a mandatory framework with detailed guidelines for internal auditing be developed as part of this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As in previous years, problems with the IT governance were prominent among the significant and moderate findings by the ANAO in the 2022-23 financial audits. Unauthorised user access to IT systems across the Commonwealth has continued to be an issue over many years, and the fifth recommendation of the committee in this inquiry— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than this lack of action, it's the practices of the Labor party in opposition in the lead up to the 2022 election, and since then in government, that show just how necessary and overdue these reforms are.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Parliamentary Library research, during the 2022 election campaign the Australia Labor Party made 435 commitments to fund certain projects.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor candidates and members promised local councils, community organisations, health services, museums, yacht clubs, cricket clubs, netball clubs, footy clubs that, if their party got elected to government, they would fund showgrounds, sporting precincts, change rooms, car parks—you know how it goes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know of course what happened next—the Labor Party won enough seats in the 2022 election to form government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is less known is what happened after that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once in government, Labor directed the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to set up two grant programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two programs are called the Investing in Our Communities Program and the Priority Community Infrastructure Program. Almost $1.35 billion was allocated to these programs in Labor's first budget in October 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, I'm not saying the government can't direct the department to set up grant programs and budget to fund them. This is absolutely a power held by the executive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But how these programs are designed and implemented absolutely warrants further scrutiny. We are talking about $1.35 billion worth of taxpayer money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recipients of funding under these two grant programs are spread across 104 electorates, of which 66 are electorates that the Australian Labor Party held or gained in the 2022 election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That means 86.8 per cent of Labor-won seats received a grant, compared to 51.7 per cent of non-Labor seats receiving a grant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This means if you live in a Labor held electorate, you are much more likely to have received funding under these programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact some seats, like Boothby in South Australia and Tangney in Western Australia, received funding for 17 and 14 projects respectively. Compare this to dozens of electorates that received zero dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said many times in this place, the spending of taxpayer money should be done fairly and transparently, with proper guidelines and selection criteria and awarded to recipients who objectively demonstrate merit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So was there a merit based, competitive application process?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the application forms for these election commitment programs, these programs are, and I quote, 'one-off, closed, non-competitive programs'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the program guidelines, to be eligible to apply you must, and again I quote, be 'invited to deliver a project identified by the Australian government'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have $1.35 billion of taxpayer money in a grant program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is no competitive process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, how did the department assess these applications?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, freedom of information requests reveal that the list of projects was developed in discussion with the minister's office and the Department of Finance, and the minister asked her department to undertake a desktop review for project merits as it was being budgeted for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at all this information together—who received a grant, the application process, and the assessment process—we must ask: does the process for determining recipients under these programs seem rigorous? Objective? Fair? Equitable? Was taxpayer money spent responsibly?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Or is this just another example of pork barrelling?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government about my concerns. I have also referred these programs to the Australian National Audit Office—the ANAO—to investigate these programs. The ANAO is the auditor for public spending. It makes sure that, when the government spends taxpayer money, it stacks up. And I want to know if these election commitment programs stack up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to introduce this private member's bill, the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Tougher Penalties for Supermarket and Hardware Businesses) Bill 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, the price of almost everything has gone up. The Prime Minister promised life would be cheaper under Labor, but that could not be further from the truth. After two years of Labor, inflation is still too high, interest rates have increased 12 times, families' real disposable income has collapsed and we are in a household recession, a per capita recession—and have been, indeed, for six quarters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we've seen interest rates going down in the United States, in Canada, in the UK, in New Zealand, in South Korea and, indeed, in Japan, there is no relief in sight here in Australia. At the same time, as mortgage payments have increased, families are paying more on their energy bills and they are paying substantially more at the check-out. For many families, the weekly shop is a huge financial stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every local member will have spoken to constituents who talk about what they see when they go to the check-out and what they get for a bag of groceries compared with what they did just a couple of short years ago. All those years seem like dog years—they seem like they are long, hard years—at the moment, I have to say. At the same time as mortgage payments have increased, we've also seen the price of everything else going up, such as insurance and everything we buy every single day. We are seeing this right across the board. Families are struggling with the cost of essential items, so it's more important than ever that they can have faith that businesses, including supermarkets, do the right thing by their customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen in recent weeks concerning findings from the ACCC in regard to supermarkets. Indeed, the ACCC is taking action. The allegations relate to practices around discounting and, if they are true, they are a damning indictment on a sector that families across Australia—and suppliers, farmers and many others as well—rely on every single day for their livelihood. This is not what we have reason to expect. It's not what families expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has been too slow to act on competition policy not just in our supermarket sector but across the economy. We've seen that with the news bargaining code, consumer data rights and the serious cartel allegations against the CFMEU. The coalition has led the way on this since the start of the term, and this package of bills is the outcome of that work, led by me and the member for Maranoa, who is here today. Our approach is all about getting the balance right—strengthening the food and grocery code and introducing a targeted divestiture penalty to put businesses and the sector on notice. The coalition's approach has been carefully designed with appropriate safeguards. It is subject to a clear public interest test, including the impact on services, jobs and shareholder value in relation to requirements to add benefits from competition. It's limiting its application to specific sectors with established structural competition challenges. It's ensuring latitude to the ACCC and affected parties to reach enforceable undertakings as an alternative. It's providing clear statutory timeframes for courts and regulators to adhere to. It's limiting the standing for a divestiture order to be brought by the regulator in relation to a section 46 abuse-of-market-power action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where a court determines there's been a breach of section 46 by a body corporate or group operating in the supermarket or hardware sector, it's open to a party to that action or to the ACCC to apply to the court for a divestiture order. The ACCC or party to that action must seek a divestiture order within 18 months of finding the breach of section 46. A court may order the group to divest its assets or shares where it's satisfied that the divestment will lead to a substantial improvement in competition—a really important safeguard—but also, as I said earlier, is in the public interest with respect to impacts on unemployment, access to goods and services, and shareholder value. A divestiture order must be completed within five years of being issued. The court can accept enforceable undertakings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is a last resort for egregious behaviour. There are many other penalties that can be proposed along the way, but this is an appropriate last resort, we believe, providing a structural solution to a structural problem. The ACCC has been explicit that Australia's supermarket sector is an oligopoly. The Woolworths and Coles market share accounts for just over two-thirds of national supermarket sales. The e61 Institute has found that Australia's supermarkets are highly concentrated in local markets, particularly in regional areas. There are high levels of customer inertia between the brands. Indeed, according to e61, 33 per cent of Woolworths customers' most likely alternative shopping destination is another Woolworths store. So these competition issues are very real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other research has shown the impact of new market entrants in the retail sector is positively correlated with innovation, increased customer choice, decreased prices and lower inflation, saving consumers $3,500 a year since 2019, including $678 on groceries. The ACCC, the Productivity Commission and the Harper review have all recognised the practice of creeping acquisition as an anti-competitive practice of the supermarket sector, and they have been doing that since 2008. So there's universal recognition that a merger regime is ineffective right now in preventing the practice of creeping acquisitions and the addition of a divestiture penalty to this sector is warranted by this ongoing structural competition issue. This will be a substantial tool in the ACCC's armoury to address anticompetitive behaviour and ensure consumers, suppliers and small businesses are treated appropriately. Indeed, the ACCC chair has noted, in response to the ACCC's action on misleading pricing against the supermarkets, 'It is essential, when pursuing competition policy enforcement, that penalties need to exceed the cost of doing business in that anticompetitive way.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some who are arguing this is out of line with what we see elsewhere in the world, and nothing could be further from the truth. But I don't expect the Prime Minister and others on the other side of the House to understand any of this. They clearly don't, and we've seen that in the sluggish way they've sought to implement competition policies in this country. The truth of the matter is that regimes along these lines exist in many of our peer countries around the world, including the United States and the UK. I was privileged enough to write my masters thesis on exactly that provision in the UK legislation, which has evolved over time and, indeed, is now reasonably close to what we are proposing here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significant divestiture orders were enacted by the Regan administration. Many will remember the 1982 AT&amp;T breakup of their telecommunications companies. And the Thatcher administration in the UK had the Beer Orders of 1989. Both the Clinton and the Bush administrations pursued significant divestiture actions against monopolies, including Microsoft. And divestiture, while rarely invoked, has been found to lead to better competition and consumer outcomes and is inherently compatible with free market economics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sort of focus we believe in is where the best regulator of any market is competition, and most importantly the consumers have that competition. If a consumer has competition, they regulate the market and they regulate it via the choices they make every single day. That's far better than any agency sitting here in Canberra, let me tell you. Competition is far better than anything any regulator can do here in this city, because the consumer knows what they want. They know what their family needs. They know what they're prepared to pay, what their household budget is and how they can allocate their scarce resources in the best possible way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite would do well to understand that rather than the heavy-handed approaches they take, it would be better if they made way for an approach where we seek more competition and, most importantly, understanding from the corporate sector that if they act in a competitive way and they give customers good choices and they avoid anticompetitive behaviour, then all of us in Australia will be better off.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me great pleasure to introduce this bill, in conjunction with the bill the member for Hume has just introduced around divestiture powers—divestiture powers that this country already has. In fact, they were voted for in this parliament in 2019. Both sides of parliament saw the need in the energy sector to make sure that consumers were protected. We kept the lights on, but tonight there will be Australians who will not be able to put food on their table. The cost-of-living crisis that's been created in this place is one where we will see—we produce enough food and fibre for 80 million people in a country as rich as this nation of ours—Australians going without dinner tonight. Why wouldn't we do everything we can in this place, with the privilege that we have been given, to make sure that we put the regulatory frameworks around the most important commodity that we need to underpin all life—our food.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a missed opportunity by this government not just to face up to divestiture powers. They were prepared to stand up to the big CEOs of the energy companies in 2019, but, today, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, they've gone missing and are not prepared to stand up to Woolworths and Coles to simply say that there needs to be a deterrent to protect both farmers, as suppliers, and consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about fairness and transparency. This isn't about fixing prices. This is simply saying that if there is a rise in the farmgate price then you should see a commensurate rise at the check-out. If there is a reduction at the farm gate in price, you should see a commensurate reduction at the check-out. It is clear that the supermarkets have played on the ignorance of many Australians who don't understand why those farm price reductions or increases happen at the time in which they happen. They've taken advantage of the farmer and the consumer, so it's important that when there is market concentration to the extent that we see here in our grocery sector that governments reach in and put in deterrents. That big deterrent, as the member for Hume has just articulated, is one that has safeguards but sends a strong message. But we don't ever want to have to use divestiture powers. That's the whole idea of it. It's about setting that standard and setting a deterrent that makes sure that those supermarkets respect their actual market power. What we need to do is increase the scale of penalties leading up to that big penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we did in a trajectory as a coalition in the last term was introduce a perishable goods inquiry from the ACCC. The ACCC at that point did not ask us to change anything in the grocery code nor in terms of divestiture powers. Subsequent to that, the evidence that we have seen and the fact that the ACCC are now in court with the two supermarkets demonstrates there is growing evidence of their behaviour and abuse of their market power and that we should do something.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We wrote to the then government after the last election, building on that work that we'd done through the perishable goods inquiry and seeing the mounting evidence that we should do more. In fact, in December 2022 I wrote to competition minister in a bipartisan way, knowing the cost-of-living pressures that were out there, to say that he should bring forward the statutory review of the grocery code of conduct from October last year to straightaway and that we would give bipartisan support for increasing penalties and making it mandatory. We make that offer to this government and they ignored it. It wasn't until we got closer to the October date and the government had done nothing, and the cost-of-living crisis was continuing to hit, that they realised that this was hurting them politically because they'd done nothing. They didn't get this up and going until January.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is they have implemented changes in legislation that will not come into effect until April 2025. The penalty increases and the mandatory nature of the code that this government moved in this House only a matter of months ago do not come into effect until April 2025. There is a cost-of-living crisis today. There are Australians tonight who will not eat, yet this government does not want to put a regulatory framework around supermarkets who control nearly 70 per cent of our grocery sector. How out of touch can you be to not understand the pain and the hurt of proud families who are struggling to pay their mortgage and who cannot look their kids in the eye and tell them they can put dinner on the table tonight, in a country as rich as this, in the privilege that we've been given to stand in this place and do something about it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mandatory code and the legislation that we bring in today would be enacted today if they took our hand and we put it through the other place. We'd get royal assent, and it would start today—not in six months time—because those families deserve support today. What we've said is: let's look at this in a sensible way of changing culture because while divestiture power is the big stick at the end of it, you actually have to have scaling penalties that change the culture of these organisations. There need to be infringement notices that are speeding tickets the ACCC can hand out to the supermarkets when they're in breach of the codes. They can simply say, 'You have breached the code, and it is a flat $2 million.' That's about change in culture. Every time the ACCC, as the tough top cop on the beat and has the powers to implement it, undertakes it immediately, hands over that $2 million fine. That changes culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, those opposite, whose bill does not come into effect until April 2025, have, to their credit, put in infringement notices. But they scale up to a maximum of $187,800. They would go to one of their tills here in Canberra and pull that out as petty cash as the cost of doing business. This is not something that scares supermarkets in any way, shape or form. For $187,800, they'd probably pay the maximum and not worry about it. Why wouldn't we give the ACCC the tools they want?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Hume just articulated, the ACCC chair said that the penalty should be greater than just the cost of doing business—$187,800 is the cost of doing business; $2 million starts to change culture. That $2 million starts to change the culture, from the CEO right through to those buying the produce from the farmer all the way through. We've said that we'll scale it up to $10 million, or 3 per cent of the financial gain of these companies, but that would be determined by a court. The ACCC would only go to court if they knew they had the ability to achieve a penalty greater than $1 million, which, if you look at the government's legislation, is where most of the infringements would land. So why would the ACCC spend millions of dollars to go to court only to get an outcome of a $1 million fine? And only in rarer cases, they get $10 million in fines. We've said that, and then there's more scaling through to divestiture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another significant piece we are bringing in that will complement this bill. It's called a supermarket commissioner. We have heard inquiry after inquiry of farmers coming forward about the mistreatment of these two supermarkets that control the market. They are the market. They have abused that power to destroy lives. I have seen that personally as an agribusiness banker in western Queensland. I'm not a top-end banker. I sat down around kitchen tables and saw the egregious conduct of these supermarkets and how they treat family farms, how they abuse that power and then destroy that farm. These farmers have come forward confidentially on numerous occasions to try to give evidence about what these supermarkets do, but many farmers are not game because they fear retribution. They fear their supply contracts being taken away, so they say nothing, and nothing gets done in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have created a supermarket commissioner so that they can bring their complaint forward in a confidential manner. The supermarket commissioner can triage it and understand whether they have a case. If the commissioner believes they have a case, the commissioner will take one of two actions. It will say to the complainant, 'We can conciliate this with the supermarkets, but if you feel there is retribution, we will escalate it to the ACCC.' Under the ACCC's powers, they will open up broader investigatory undertakings, not just of the individual but of broader individuals, so that the confidentiality of those individuals is maintained and that the ACCC can then make their decisions and use the infringement notice or take it court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sensible framework that puts sunshine on the behaviour of these supermarkets. They have done to so many consumers what they have done to farmers. If these supermarkets have done nothing wrong and are as pure as the driven snow, as they keep telling us, they have nothing to fear. This is the exact framework that sits at the moment. There are just higher penalties as a deterrent. What do those opposite have to lose? What are they hiding behind? Please—we have a responsibility to get this right. Here is your opportunity. This is your moment. Where are you going to stand?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is designed to improve and streamline the financial planning process. We have seen over the past 16 years a massive increase in red tape and regulation in this sector resulting in advice being too expensive, too hard to access and strangled by red tape. We have seen the unmet advice need continue to grow across our economy because people simply cannot afford financial advice. We have seen advisers close their books because they are flat out managing their existing client base because of the regulatory impost and are no longer able to take new clients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill is to streamline the engagement process between the financial adviser and client and it does this in two ways. First, it creates the requirement to provide a clear and concise letter of engagement which will be provided to a client prior to receiving any financial advice. This letter confirms the clear and transparent agreement between the adviser and the client that clearly outlines the scope of advice to be provided. Secondly, this bill removes the requirement for the provision of a statement of advice. The reason this is important is these are currently 100-page documents that nobody reads—that nobody reads. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important bit in all of this is: what is the advice that is being provided and how does that relate to the scope of advice being sought? That is why in this bill we replace the statement of advice with what is called a record of advice. The term 'record of advice' and use is already well understood across the industry and is an existing provision within the Corporations Act. These changes are meant to ensure the client will be provided with the advice they seek in a way that is clear, concise and easy to understand. More importantly, in simplifying this process, it is expected to reduce the cost and time taken to produce statements of advice, in that they are being replaced by these records of advice. This new process differs from the existing obligations to provide the statement of advice for some clients but not all. In this process it will be required for all clients for any scope of advice sought. In part, the recommendations of the Levy review touched on this and this was, in part, the basis for these changes. Also, the government has failed to do anything in a space over the last two years despite talking a good game.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In her review, Michelle Levy referred to getting rid of statements of advice altogether. I am not of the view the statement of advice should be removed altogether because I think the agreement between the adviser and the client should be in written form. I don't believe that having a verbal understanding or agreement in this space, given the complexity of some of the work that is done for clients, is a good outcome for either the client or adviser. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes also ensure that the advice provided to the client is directly relevant to the scope of advice sought. This provides a clear link to demonstrate that the adviser has listened to the client's needs and concerns with regard to the advice being sought, and then that can be clearly demonstrated as being delivered by the record of advice. The adviser will still need to retain in their files all the relevant working papers and notes et cetera. That is a given. But it is the importance of the documentation that is provided to the client that is simple, concise and clear and demonstrates that the advice being provided is relevant to what is sought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give this simple example: a 23-year-old tradie who's coming in and wants an income protection policy. Why should they have to go through a whole process that results in a 100-page document that is going to cost several thousand dollars in costs because of the complexity when all they need is some straightforward advice on an income protection policy that is suitable to their situation at that point in time? Why can that not be provided through a letter of engagement which clearly states the scope and then a record of advice which clearly shows why that policy that is being recommended is suitable to their needs? It shouldn't be any more difficult than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is the whole intention of this bill. Yes, he might become a longer term client, where you talk about superannuation and a whole range of other issues, but at that point in time that is the piece of advice that he needs, and that is exactly what this bill is trying to achieve—simplify the process, reduce the paperwork and ensure there is something that is relevant to the client that they're going to read and understand. But, at the same time, it makes clear the adviser's obligations to ensure that the advice that they provide is directly relevant to the scope of advice agreed to in the letter of engagement. That is what we are trying to get to with this bill. I am going to hand my remaining time to the shadow assistant minister for financial services.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I second the motion and rise to speak on the member for Forde's private member's bill, the Corporations Amendment (Streamlining Advice Process) Bill 2024. I commend the member for Forde, who's got a lot of experience in this industry, for this bill, which is an important step towards reducing red tape for financial advisers and Australians that need the advice. The Albanese Labor government's inaction on financial advice reforms is leaving Australians underadvised and underinsured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been 689 days since Michelle Levy handed down to the Albanese government her quality-of-advice review's final report—689 days! The government has failed advisers by leaving the implementation of the review's most important red-tape-reducing recommendations to the very last minute, including the recommendation to remove statements of advice. Action on reforming the burdensome statement of advice process is long overdue, and these reforms will significantly reduce the time and cost of providing advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Levy review found on average that it can take up to 14 hours to produce a statement of advice. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis under the Albanese government, where 12 interest rate rises have sent rents through the roof and people's mortgages through the roof at the same time that immigration has ramped up and homelessness is on the rise, people can't get advice, because the statement of advice—the red tape and regulation that's been put in place in this House—takes up to 14 hours to do. For a financial adviser that has a firm with a secretary and staff and everything else—rent, wages, super and all the rest of it—you can be paying $200 to $300 an hour. At $250 an hour times 14, you're up for $3,500 just to get a statement of advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forde was spot on when he spoke about the tradie that needs some financial advice. The bill that the member for Forde has put forward can cut that advice by perhaps up to 12 hours. So all of a sudden, you have a bill that goes down from $3½ thousand to $500. That's smart work from the member for Forde. That's what we should be doing in this House. Every minister in this government should be thinking daily: 'How do we reduce regulation? How do we reduce red tape?' Right now Australians and small businesses are heaving under the weight of the regulation in this place, and the Albanese government needs to cut red tape. We know the FAAA and other associations, such as the Financial Services Council, are behind reducing red tape.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken many times in this House about the importance of education to my late mother. While in refugee camps in Hong Kong, my mother chose to be resettled in Australia because she believed that Australia had the best education system in the world. It had. Ever since my election in 2022 I have spent the last few years engaging with youth and my community in Fowler through doorknocking, and I know that the increase in cost of living has impacted their everyday life profoundly. For the young people living in my area, travelling to and from university costs them time as our public transport system is not connected. It costs them money as they have to pay for the increased fares, tolls, petrol, food, costs and materials for their courses. That's not to mention the HECS debt, which I started to call for the reduction of when I first set foot in the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the challenges of growing up in a low-income household and having to balance work life with continuing tertiary education. I was working full time as a reporter while studying my Bachelor of Arts degree. I chose a simple arts degree, majoring in international relations and infused with philosophy and political science. I chose an arts degree because it allowed me to explore a broad range of subjects, and I wanted to increase my knowledge about what was happening in many parts of the world, while at the same time I wanted to understand the views and perspectives of the world of philosophers like Socrates, Plato, Adam Smith, Thomas Aquinas and Hannah Arendt during their existence. I believe the arts degree broadened my thinking and knowledge, contributing to my life's journey which led me to be elected as the first Independent member of my wonderful federal electorate in Fowler—a very multicultural and very diverse community. I can't emphasise enough how humbling the opportunity is, and will be, for me for a long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I did not have to face during the time of studying my arts degree was the enormous spiralling debt that would confront me as soon as I entered the workforce. What the Higher Education Support Amendment (Fair Study and Opportunity) Bill 2024 does is begin to address the completely unfair and unreasonable course costs that have been imposed on arts students since the commencement of the Job-ready Graduates Scheme, or the JRG, which was introduced by the Morrison government. This policy, which the Albanese government seems to drag their feet on, has seen students charged over three times as much per unit for studying subjects related to history, archaeology, anthropology and political science, just to name a few, compared to maths, education and agriculture. Indeed, the subjects listed under the 'society and culture' cluster now attract the maximum fee chargeable to students, alongside law, banking, finance, business and management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that many members on all sides of the House believe that this is wrong. I'm sure there would be many Young Labor and Young Liberal members who would very much appreciate their members supporting this bill. The JRG package was introduced, in theory, to incentivise students to choose STEM subjects at university, but the JRG package was premised on the incorrect assumption that students would respond to price signalling that disincentivised enrolling in arts courses. So unsuccessful has the JRG package been that students have continued to register in arts courses despite the enormous cost involved. All this has achieved is to unfairly burden arts students financially before they have had a chance to begin their careers. This has led to unintended consequences of systematic inequity within the education system simply because certain students chose their passions in arts and culture. How is this an equitable education system? Even, if JRG had been successful in pushing Australia's students into STEM fields, this would still be a flawed approach. Australia needs to have men and women educated in the fields of history, geography, politics and archaeology. While STEM is important in seeking solutions to questions as to what can be done with the earth's precious resources, arts degrees look at the deeper questions of how technology impacts us and assesses the moral questions raised by these advances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a great concern for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and is seeking to understand the cultures that existed before colonisation and how they continue to share a common life. Anthropology has arguably never been as important to Australian life as it is today as we seek to find our identity as Australians in the 21st century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students from my electorate of Fowler are disproportionately affected by the JRG policy. Professor Michelle Arrow of Macquarie University, who is president of the Australian Historical Association, has told me that the JRG legislation has:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… brought inequity to so many students, especially poor, Indigenous, and women students seeking to make a better life for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fowler is one of the poorest areas of our nation and has the largest community of non-English-speaking families. The fact that many of our young people get to enter university is testament to their hard work and the efforts of our wonderful schools and community groups. Punishing them with hiked up fees is a real kick in the teeth to their aspirations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as lawmakers in this House can do better than this. We entered this House to make a difference to our communities. Sometimes there are unfortunate results, despite our best intentions. This bill seeks to begin to put right a policy that was all downside. There was no benefit for the community. Many art students have been left worse off, especially those struggling in Western Sydney. Do not forget them.</span>

I rise to support the Higher Education Support Amendment (Fair Study and Opportunity) Bill 2024, and I commend the member for Fowler for introducing it.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Society and culture subjects at our universities aren't just mere subjects to tack onto a degree; they're a critical source of learning which equips students to gain a greater depth of understanding about the communities and world in which we live. These subjects shape and develop students' understandings of a wide range of topics from history, philosophy, archaeology and sociology to Indigenous issues and the impacts of rapidly changing technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When students undertake these courses of study, they're not just about theory. Students are engaging in meaningful and relevant courses of study which lay the foundation for careers in a wide variety of fields for the benefit of our country. These subjects develop skills in critical thinking, analytics, problem-solving and an understanding of how our societies work—skills that are essential to building stronger communities, including country communities. In May this year, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> published an article on its analysis of the educational background of the 226 federal politicians in Australia. Out of the 151 members of parliament and 75 senators currently in office, 77 per cent have a bachelor's degree or higher, and, when it came to the type of degree, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> found about 40 per cent of federal politicians studied arts at university, which was, by a long shot, the most popular degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The unkind may well say, 'If politicians are studying it, maybe we shouldn't support it.' While I myself don't have an arts degree, my point is that politics is just one of a wide array of pathways opened up by an arts and humanities education. There are many others. Look at our historians. How can we as a nation chart a course for the future if we don't have an understanding of where we've been? The list goes on and on. Many of our distinguished educators, jurists and businesspeople have studied arts and humanities. While I certainly don't begrudge students studying STEM with lower course fees, we really do need to question whether the Jobs-ready Graduates Package has been effective or successful. The Australian Universities Accord report certainly doesn't think so. The accord found that only 1.5 per cent of students changed their courses as a result of the scheme. It's also resulted in an inequitable and unfair student loans scheme, where students in the humanities, arts and communications get slugged more. It is fundamentally unjust and unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm with the accord on this. We need to overhaul the whole ineffective Jobs-ready Graduates Package, which has turned out to be a fail. This bill is a positive step in that direction. I commend it to the House, and I commend the hard-working member for Fowler for bringing this important legislation before us today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The planning and development of critical infrastructure is one of the core responsibilities of government. This infrastructure enables our cities and regions to thrive, and it underpins Australia's way of life. Under the National Partnership Agreement, the federal government has committed $120 billion towards infrastructure projects over the next 10 years through the infrastructure investment pipeline. Infrastructure is a sizeable portfolio. It's the seventh biggest expenditure item, only after things like health, defence and social security. Given its size and importance, Australians reasonably expect that infrastructure funding is allocated diligently and methodically to manage the trade-offs and maximise benefits to the country. But they would be wrong in assuming so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year two separate and independent reports handed down scathing indictments of the federal government's handling of the national infrastructure investment pipeline. In August last year the independent strategic review found, 'There are projects in the infrastructure investment pipeline that do not demonstrate merit, lack any national strategic rationale and do not meet the Australian government's national investment priorities.' Similarly in November, the mandatory review of the National Partnership Agreement on Land Transport Infrastructure Projects, the Halton review, found that the lack of information gathering and due diligence 'undermines the Commonwealth's capacity to be an informed investor in land transport infrastructure'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes much deeper than one project being approved ahead of another. The suboptimal allocation of infrastructure funding is contributing to capacity constraints in an already stretched construction sector. This is forcing projects to come in well over budget and compete against other national priorities, most importantly housing. As a result, the infrastructure investment pipeline identified $33 billion in additional known cost pressures as a result of 'a clogged infrastructure pipeline that does not reflect current market capacity'. Let that sink in for a moment. Cost blowouts now represent 30 per cent of the total initial budget allocation of the IIP at a time when inflation is rife and we need the construction sector to urgently deliver more homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem has been brewing under governments of both stripes. Just last week, the COVID review indicated that the coalition's excessive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus provided throughout 2021 and 2022, especially in the construction sector, had contributed to inflationary pressures coming out of the pandemic. It's therefore commendable that the government initiated the review of the IIP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the response from the government has been disappointing. The review of the IIP recommended 82 projects not yet under construction be immediately ceased and 36 projects not yet under construction be immediately re-evaluated. But the government's response was limited to a list of 50 projects where funding has been withdrawn. We have no way of telling whether the government's projects—their 50—overlay with the 80 projects that the review recommended be ceased or re-evaluated, because the government still have not released the IIP review in full. Instead, they've only released the executive summary. The response included no strategies for how the government would seek to address cost pressures now or into the future, and the government still has not responded to the Halton review, despite the report's release almost a year ago. This tells me that the government's commitment to improving the process is superficial at best. Both major parties have, earlier this term, resisted calls that I and others have made for better spending integrity and accountability in government infrastructure spending. Flashy announcements and lack of transparency have been and continue to be key election strategies, it seems, for the incumbent, with the government even rejecting amendments based mainly on Albanese's own amendments that he put forward when he was the shadow infrastructure minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enough is enough. In the coming months I'll be introducing a private member's bill aimed at improving spending integrity in transport infrastructure, and I'm calling on the government to immediately publish detailed responses to the reviews of both the IIP and the National Partnership Agreement, including releasing the IIP review in full; committing to implementing long-term investment strategies and the publishing of detailed business cases for all large-scale structure projects; and immediately acting on the recommendations of these reviews and pausing non-essential infrastructure spending until capacity has been restored. The government will try and say that the information is commercial-in-confidence, but this excuse is simply not good enough. The sector needs greater transparency and greater accountability, and it needs it now.</span>

                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  From new surf clubs to improvements to local showgrounds and playgrounds and major roadworks, community projects are boosting livability, improving roads and supporting local jobs in my electorate of Gilmore. Almost five years on from the Black Summer bushfires, and with several floods, storms and a global pandemic thrown in, the shell-shocked communities of the New South Wales South Coast are yet to fully recover. By investing in community infrastructure in these regions, the Albanese government is boosting morale, giving local communities the confidence to rebuild and, importantly, providing devastated villages with things to enhance the lifestyle of residents and visitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The township of Lake Conjola was absolutely devastated by the 2019-20 New Year's Eve bushfire. While homes are slowly being rebuilt, there remains a feeling of sadness as residents go about their lives still surrounded by the charred reminders of that horrible day. Providing the Conjola Park community with funding for a new regional boat ramp, a new jetty and floating fishing pontoon and a new playground for local children who lived through the trauma of that day has been life changing. Local families can launch their boats and kayaks, dip a line in and connect with their neighbours at the new barbecue and playground. It's just fantastic. I'm also pleased to see work underway on the $1.56 million improvements to the Lake Conjola fire station and the brand new $3.48 million purpose-built fire shed soon to be built at neighbouring Manyana. It's so wonderful that this government is providing infrastructure in the regions where it is needed and where it really is making a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the southern end of my electorate, I'm thrilled that the new $2.9 million Mogo Local Aboriginal Land Council building will open its doors, marking another milestone in the town's social and economic recovery and providing a space for community and cultural connection. I have to say that seeing the huge smiles on the faces of the local children the day I cut the ribbon to open their amazing new playground at the Malua Bay Beach Reserve was absolutely priceless. Families took refuge on this beach during the fires, so to see such a wonderful, inclusive facility rise from the ashes was just delightful. Watching young kids using the climbing gym and flying fox and shooting some hoops with the local teenagers made me feel so proud that I played a part in making this community dream a reality. We've just opened a new canteen and amenities block at the Moruya Showground, and hundreds of mountain bike enthusiasts from around the country are flocking to the South Coast to enjoy the Wild Wombat and Cosmic Thunder at the new Mogo Trails.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really great to see work almost complete on the Gerringong Surf Club's new clubhouse, a $5.5 million election commitment I made and delivered to 300-plus members. I'm proud to have secured $800,000 in federal funding for the Ulladulla Milton Lions Club's Jindelara respite cottage, which will provide respite care and independent living opportunities for people with a disability. In September there were smiles aplenty when the Yumaro Nursery and Garden Centre's Sanctuary of Support was opened in Ulladulla, an important employment and learning hub that is changing the lives of people with a disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Jervis Bay, the jewel in Shoalhaven's crown, the sensational $2.5 million mangrove boardwalk, meandering over crystal-clear waters, is proving a big hit at Huskisson. I'm really thrilled when I look at the projects this government has helped get off the ground and I've delivered and how many community groups have benefited. I understand the needs of my communities and I am committed to achieving them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government continues to help local councils with cost pressures on existing projects to ensure they can be delivered. The Far North Collector Road is one such project. Fully funded by the federal government and built by Shoalhaven City Council, the $35 million road could not have been completed without an additional $2.4 million provided in the 2024 budget. Like in all regional areas, roads are at the top of the agenda, and I'm so proud to have delivered more than $1 billion in funding for roads in the Shoalhaven, including an additional $25.1 million to ensure the completion of the new Nowra Bridge and $100 million for the Jervis Bay intersection flyover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The wheels are turning on the Nowra bypass, with $97 million I've delivered, and after four decades $752 million is finally getting the Milton Ulladulla bypass moving. I'm proud to have delivered billions of dollars in infrastructure projects in my electorate of Gilmore throughout the local government areas of Kiama, Shoalhaven and the Eurobodalla.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to tackling the cost-of-living pressures facing Australians. We won't stand by as supermarkets and retailers take advantage of the people that they are meant to serve. This motion recognises the critical role that our government is playing in building stronger, more competitive markets that put downward pressure on prices for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that people in our community have been doing it very tough. The supermarket check-out is one of the sharpest reminders of the pressures on household budgets. Just a couple of months ago, the ACCC announced legal action against major supermarkets for allegedly engaging in deceptive pricing practices. The ACCC claimed that both Coles and Woolworths were temporarily inflating their prices so they could later mark them as discounts. That, in reality, offered no real savings—sometimes even charging more than the original price for the same products. This kind of behaviour is more than just deceptive; it shows utter contempt for Australian shoppers trying to stretch their budgets just that little bit further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is determined to take decisive action to prevent this type of manipulation and ensure that consumers get fairer prices at the supermarkets, in stores and online. Australians deserve transparency, fairness and honesty in pricing, and we're committed to delivering real, impactful solutions. That's why we've announced $30 million in additional funding to boost the ACCC's ability to monitor, investigate and enforce against pricing practices that raise such concerns. This funding will empower the ACCC to actively pursue cases where supermarkets and retailers may be unjustifiably inflating prices—all while hiding behind vague or misleading practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are not stopping there. The Treasurer is also working closely with state and territory leaders with the Council on Federal Financial Relations to reform planning and zoning regulations. These outdated frameworks, which include restrictive zoning laws and planning restrictions, currently stand as obstacles to genuine competition. They allow land banking, keeping prime retail space off the market, driving up costs for consumers and limiting choices in our communities. We're dismantling these barriers to ensure that more stores can open and consumers can get real choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is fully aware of the challenges Australian households are facing. For many, the rising cost of groceries is not just inconvenient; it's a source of real financial strain. That's why we are backing up our commitments with action and resources. The ACCC has reported that it is facing numerous issues in the sector that it would like to investigate, but the resources simply haven't been there—until now. The additional $30 million in funding over the next 3½ years will allow the ACCC to pursue its vital work. It will help ensure that supermarkets play fair and Australians can see genuine relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes come in addition to the Albanese Labor government's recently announced overhaul of Australian merger laws. That legislation currently before the House focuses particularly on supermarket mergers and is critical to protecting fair competition in a sector that impacts on every Australian household. By ensuring the ACCC is notified of all proposed mergers in the supermarket industry, we are making it clear that consolidation in this sector will not go unchecked. Supermarket mergers have the potential to reduce competition and drive up prices, directly affecting families, pensioners and everyday Australia trying to stretch their budgets. By keeping the supermarket sector as competitive as possible, we are working to deliver fairer prices at the checkout and prevent the formulation of monopolies that would hurt consumers in the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion and the measures the Albanese Labor government is putting forward are about delivering genuine relief to Australians feeling the weight of cost-of-living pressures. We know that Australians are being stretched thin, and we are committed to using every lever available to promote fair competition, reduce unnecessary price hikes and ensure that grocery bills reflect real value for our communities. By equipping the ACCC with the resources it needs, strengthening our competition policy and implementing reforms to scrutinise supermarket mergers, we are protecting Australians from inflated prices and helping to keep more money in their pockets.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  Since the last election, food prices have risen by 12 per cent. In 2½ years, they've risen 12 per cent. Health costs are up 10.5 per cent. Housing is up 13 per cent. Gas is up 33 per cent. Insurance is up 17 per cent. I could go on. We are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, and nowhere is this being felt more than when it comes to food prices. Everyone has seen it on a daily basis because, when they go to the supermarket, there before them they are seeing that prices continue to go up and up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the government has no answer to this cost-of-living crisis. That is why the coalition is putting forward policies to fix the mess that the Labor government have made. What we are doing today is making sure we are standing up for working families and our farmers. The coalition is standing up for those working families and for our farmers by introducing the Food and Grocery (Mandatory) Code of Conduct Bill 2024. This private member's bill will restore fairness for consumers, families, suppliers and farmers. What will this plan do? It will make the food and grocery code of conduct mandatory for supermarkets with an annual turnover of at least $5 billion. It will have higher penalties for breaches of the code—the greater of $10 million, three times the value of the benefit obtained from a contravention or, where the court can't determine the benefit from a contravention, 10 per cent of annual turnover. This will enable infringement penalties of $2 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission powers to undertake audits of supermarkets to ensure that supermarkets are compliant with the code; create a supermarket commissioner to act as a confidential avenue for farmers and suppliers to address the fear of retribution; and also introduce the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Tougher Penalties for Supermarket and Hardware Businesses) Bill 2024 to establish sector-specific divestiture powers in the hands of the ACCC and the courts, not members of parliament, as a last resort to address the behaviour of supermarkets and to put an end to instances of price gouging. Divestiture powers will come with appropriate public interest safeguards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is committed to delivering competition policy which supports consumers and smaller businesses, not the big corporations and lobbyists. Competitive markets benefit everyone by ensuring lower prices, creating more employment opportunities and fostering innovation. Labor have completely failed on competition policy, and that is why we are seeing people paying so much more at the supermarket. Labor have failed to address inflation and to be able to drive interest rates down, and that is what is really hurting Australians. When it comes to rural and regional Australia and to my electorate of Wannon, it is exactly the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What people want to see is a government that is focused on getting cost-of-living pressures down. What people want to see is a government that is going to address inflation and make sure it deals with inflation. I'm sorry to have to report this, but right now the Australian people are looking at this government and the Prime Minister and saying: 'He looks weak. He looks like he can't do anything to address these issues. He looks incompetent.' They are calling out for action, and that is why we are introducing this private member's bill today to make sure that we're stepping up where the government is failing. We understand, and have seen for 2½ years, that the cost-of-living pressure is hurting. We are now providing the solutions that the government should have been adopting for a long, long time. So I say to everyone listening today: rest assured the opposition understands your difficulties, and that's why we're putting solutions forward.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Hawke for bringing this important motion to the House. Our government has been very squarely focused on repairing a set of economic circumstances which we inherited from the previous government and which was not in good nick, and we've been very squarely focused on relieving pressure on households. Despite the politicking we just heard from the previous speaker, we have been putting some really substantial bills before the House and passing legislation. Despite the revisionist history from those opposite, we have been taking active steps and taking very seriously the circumstances that everyday households find themselves living in in this country, largely as a result of the terrible mismanagement of the economy by the previous government. I really wish that this work were above politics for those opposite and that they had supported many of the measures that we've put forward in our term of government to relieve pressure on households, such as energy bill relief, increasing wages and the measures before us today in terms of our action in relation to supermarket pricing, because we don't want to see ordinary Australians, families and pensioners being taken for a ride by the supermarkets. In my electorate of Chisholm, we undertook a survey of the community in relation to their views on supermarket pricing, and I used the information that I garnered from that process to make a submission to the ACCC inquiry on my community's behalf. I will always be prepared to speak up for my community and for fairness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, we inherited a terrible set of circumstances from the previous government but we are squarely focused on fixing the economy, on making sure inflation gets under control and on making life easier for households right across Australia. It would be really nice if, for once, the opposition could work with us to do this rather than use this moment as a political football and to be tacticians rather than leaders. Our government is taking decisive action to help consumers get fairer prices at the supermarket check-out in stores and online. As we know, the Prime Minister and Treasurer have announced funding of around $30 million to help the ACCC conduct more investigations and enforcement in the supermarket and retail sectors. This will enhance the regulator's ability to monitor behaviour and to investigate pricing practices where there are concerns about supermarkets and retailers falsely justifying higher prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the Treasurer will work closely with states and territories through the Council on Federal Financial Relations to reform planning and zoning regulations, which will help boost competition supermarket sector by opening up more sites for new stores. Current planning and zoning frameworks including land-use restrictions, zoning laws and planning regulations are unfortunately acting as a barrier to competition. By inhibiting businesses entering expansion, they potentially allow for things like land banking, which prevents competition and pushes up prices in our local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House we understand people are under pressure and at the check-out is one of the places they feel it the sharpest. This extra funding provided to the ACCC will ensure a fair go for Australians from the supermarkets. The ACCC has told the government there are issues it is seeing an economy it would like to investigate but it needs more resources to do so. The additional $30 million in resourcing over 3½ years will give the ACCC what it needs to pursue the type of process it announced in its allegations against the supermarkets, which is a step that our government decided to take after years of inaction by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the coalition and the Greens, our government has policies on supermarket and grocery prices that can be implemented now, will work and make economic sense. The Emerson review of the Food and Grocery Code looked at divestiture and it didn't recommend it. The review pointed out it could actually make things worse. Our government is really focused on making things better for households across Australia, making supermarket prices fairer, and I would really urge those opposite to stop using this moment just to engage in political tactics and do the right thing by Australian households and back our government's plan in.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I want to start by saying that generally over time the supermarkets have done a pretty good job. We do need the supermarkets. They provide a service, they provide a way for farmers to sell their produce and they provide a service for Australian people buy food. We do need them. We need them to be profitable but we need them to be fair and we need them to provide sustainability for their suppliers. We also need competition amongst supermarkets to make sure we get that balance we are looking for in this policy. The balance is we want the lowest possible and fair prices for consumers but we don't want to threaten the businesses of the suppliers who supply the supermarkets. That is the critical balance we have to get in this policy. There have been instances where the supermarkets have abused their market power and those have been highlighted in the recent inquiries in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people will know that my electorate of Nicholls is the food bowl—there are a lot of food bowls including in Toowoomba—of Australia and it grows 90 per cent of Australia's pears, nearly 50 per cent of Australia's apples, peaches, a huge amount of Australia's dairy exports and processed dairy products, so I and my constituents do have some experience in dealing with supermarkets. What the farm businesses have told me is, yes, there can be a good relationship with supermarkets but there have been times when the supermarkets have taken advantage of the fact that these people have a perishable product and that is not fair. They've also said that there's nothing more soul-destroying than going into a supermarket and seeing the goods that you've produced being sold for less than the cost of production. So I think the private member's bill that was brought in by the member for Maranoa and the member for Hume this morning is a great step forward in the way we look at supermarkets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a lot said about the divestiture powers that our policy entails, and there's been some serious misreporting on this issue. I've read articles by lazy journalists, if I can call them that, saying, 'Oh, the Nationals want to break up the big supermarkets.' That's ridiculous. All we're doing, with the coalition, is putting a deterrent in so that the supermarkets are less likely to abuse their market power. To say, 'The Nationals want to break up the supermarkets,' is like saying, every time you pass a law that's got a jail term, that you want to put everyone in jail. It's nonsense. I hope those divestiture powers are never used, but I also hope, and I believe, that the supermarkets will look at those enhanced powers, the higher fines and the divestiture powers, and say, 'We'd better not test this out, because we don't want to fall foul of what that might mean for us.' That will lead to better behaviour; to better outcomes for the suppliers of products to the supermarkets, the farmers around Australia; and to better outcomes for consumers, who will pay prices that are fair and as low as possible within the bounds of sustainability for farm businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that the private member's bill and the coalition policy will do is appoint a supermarket commissioner, and that supermarket commissioner will act as an impartial, confidential avenue for farmers and suppliers to have their grievances heard. We certainly need that, so I think that's a really important part of the coalition's policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I've got left, I note that the most important thing for Australian people is to have cheap, reliable and sustainably produced food, and I include business sustainability along with environmental sustainability in that. Policies that attack agriculture do not provide a sustainable supply chain for food in this country. Taking more irrigation water away from irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin, forcing farmers to pay a biosecurity tax and making industrial relations laws so difficult that small businesses—and, let's face it, most farms are small businesses—can't navigate when they're trying to employ people are just some of the many policies that are an attack on agriculture and, therefore, an attack on the economy in my region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policies that the coalition presented this morning are very good and should be supported.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  In my electorate of Gilmore, we have the second-highest number of age pensioners of any electorate in the country, and the average household weekly income is $1,293, putting Gilmore in the bottom 16 electorates in Australia. Our pensioners are struggling with the cost of living, as are families across Gilmore and, indeed, all over the country. That's why we're putting in place measures to help them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is working hard across many levels to provide real cost-of-living relief, and, for many families and pensioners, saving on their weekly grocery bill is top of the agenda. With grocery prices on the rise, the supermarket check-out is one place where people are tightening their belts, so we want to make sure their dollar is going further with every shop. We don't want to see ordinary Australians, including families and pensioners, being taken for a ride by the supermarkets. That's why we're taking decisive action to help consumers get fairer prices at the check-out, both in stores and online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have announced $30 million in funding to help the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission conduct more investigations and enforcement in the supermarket and retail sectors. This extra funding over 3½ years will enhance the ACCC's ability to monitor supermarkets and retailers and to investigate consumer concerns about falsely justified higher prices. This government is giving the ACCC what it needs to pursue the type of process that it announced in its allegations against the supermarkets. We're cracking down on supermarkets, and we're doing this to ensure that people who are doing it tough all around Australia are getting a fair go. We all know how fired up shoppers become when they feel they're getting ripped off at the check-out. I know I get frustrated by hard-to-read supermarket labels and confusing pricing on the shelves, so I understand how difficult it must be for Gilmore's thousands of age pensioners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By providing CHOICE with $1.1 million to conduct quarterly price-monitoring reports for three years, the Albanese government is giving all Australians the information they need to get the best deal on their weekly shop. The CHOICE 'basket of goods' report presents data based on the purchase of 14 common grocery items at major supermarkets to help consumers make informed decisions about what they're buying. This initiative is an important part of the government's broader efforts to boost competition and put downward pressure on the price of essentials. It's another way we are making our supermarkets as competitive as they can be so Australians get the best prices possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also clamping down on unfair and excessive card surcharges, because every extra cent and every extra dollar at the check-out is another hit in the back pocket of ordinary Australians. People shouldn't be slugged with excessive surcharges when they tap their card or phone at their corner store, coffee shop, petrol station or supermarket. We're getting tough so consumers get a better deal and to reduce costs for small businesses by creating a more competitive payment system across the retail sector. Consumers shouldn't be punished for using cards or digital payments, but at the same time we must ensure that small businesses aren't paying hefty fees just to get paid themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has announced $2.1 million for the ACCC to tackle excessive surcharges. This funding will enable the consumer watchdog to crack down on illegal and unfair surcharging practices and increase education and compliance activities. We're prepared to ban debit card surcharging from 1 January 2026, subject to further work by the Reserve Bank and safeguards to ensure small businesses and consumers can both benefit from lower costs. The Reserve Bank of Australia is responsible for regulating the payment system and is undertaking a review of merchant card payment costs and surcharging. The RBA's review is an important step to reduce the costs small businesses face when processing payments. At the end of the day, we want to ease costs for consumers without added costs for small businesses or unintended consequences for the broader economy. Reducing excessive surcharges will help people and small business owners keep more of their hard-earned money in their wallets and bank accounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's inquiry into pricing and competition in the supermarket sector run by the ACCC, the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct review, the Competition Taskforce's focus on cost-of-living initiatives and the CHOICE quarterly reports will help consumers get a better deal at the check-out and reduce cost-of-living pressures for all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I welcomed the government's direction to the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into the Australian supermarket sector. At a time when so many businesses, primary producers and families are experiencing economic pain, we need to ensure that fairness prevails in a sector dominated by just two companies. Given the ACCC's consumer survey received more than 21,400 responses, more than any other survey previously conducted, the question of fairness was very much on notice. The survey highlighted what I am hearing on a regular basis, with families buying less food, skipping meals and experiencing emotional distress when grocery shopping. Of respondents in the lowest household income bracket of less than $499 per week after tax, 76 per cent reported spending at least 20 per cent of their post-tax income on groceries, and 28 per cent reported spending at least 40 per cent of their post-tax income on groceries. This is a national disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amid this tragedy, we have the Reserve Bank governor on a salary of $1 million warning some Australians that they may have to sell their home in order to cope with high inflation and interest rates. We have Australians that can't feed themselves, let alone house themselves. Such advice from overpaid bureaucrats is not only insulting but demonstrates the abject disconnect between the haves and the have-nots. As grocery prices have soared 23 per cent between the March 2019 quarter and the June 2024 quarter, Australians have been forced to put fewer grocery items in the trolley, and many of those items have also shrunk. We've even coined a term for it, calling it shrinkflation. This isn't the only deception. The ACCC has commenced separate proceedings in the Federal Court against Woolworths and Coles for allegedly breaching the Australian Consumer Law by misleading consumers through discount pricing, suggesting that the Woolworths 'Prices Dropped' and Coles 'Down Down' promotion prices were higher than or the same as those of other products or the same as their previous regular prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This behaviour has been allowed to flourish as a consequence of the duopoly that we have. The two companies account for 67 per cent of all grocery sales, which is, with the exception of New Zealand and Norway, the highest level of supermarket and grocery concentration across 15 countries selected in the report using comparable population sizes and geography. Without drastic intervention, I don't see this dominance waning. Land banking, a practice used by the majors to create barriers to entry, remains a significant problem. Woolworths currently maintains interest in 110 sites and Coles in 42 sites. By comparison, Aldi has a mere 13 sites held for future development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The influence of the supermarket duopoly affects consumers, producers and every touchpoint along the supply chain. Last week I met with a producer who shared abhorrent stories of unscrupulous exploitation and the deliberate and systematic abuse of the supermarkets' position as the price maker. One recent example consisted of producers seeking 40c more per unit—this is for a perishable item—than what was offered, when, incidentally, the 40c was the only profit component. Rather than negotiate, the supermarket put signs up on their shelves across many stores, advising customers that the product was not available due to weather conditions. Rather than negotiate a fair price with the farmer, they denied both the farmer and the consumer. Another example is contractors requiring suppliers to pay for the artwork on store branded products, charging each of them as much as $750 for the same artwork, which was designed in house by the supermarket for a fraction of the cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the ACCC plans further examination of the buying power of Coles and Woolworths, but these examples identify the market power imbalance, and the need for an in-depth examination is urgent. But we also need to make sure that we carry a big stick with this, because at the moment we're not. It's quite obvious to me that Coles and Woolworths are laughing at us and are laughing at farmers every step of the way. If that very recent example does not demonstrate that, I don't know what will. I thank the member for this motion, but we absolutely need to do more in this place so we're fairer on farmers and we're fairer on consumers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(f) APRA will not proceed with changes to a phase-out of the bank debt securities, pending a holistic review of the MLH regime in 2025, ensuring smaller ADIs can continue to compete;</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(c) unnecessary Government regulation will further erode competition in the banking sector and hinder efforts to bolster Australia's economic dynamism, particularly at a time when banks are managing 130 new regulatory changes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In brief, overregulation is a cost, and I'm calling APRA out for this. Their proposed changes, made in November 2023, would have done exactly that. We have good regulation. We have a strong, secure and stable banking sector. When we go down the pathway of overregulating that sector, we reduce competition and we pass on costs to mums and dads and consumers out there. We must call that out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the House Standing Committee on Economics for its strong work in getting to the bottom of this, pointing out exactly what APRA was trying to do and pointing out that this was an issue we needed to act on. I commend the government's attention on this detail as well. We cannot allow a regulator to make provisions that will hurt Australians, particularly in a cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very last point I want to make here is that small banks matter. APRA, you need to take care with the regulation you bring through to try and make small banks compete on liquidity with big banks; you will not get an even playing field.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—This report follows the committee's first interim report that was tabled in the House on 15 August. The Joint Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society was appointed to inquire into and report on the influence and impacts of social media on Australian society, the decision of Meta to abandon deals under the news media bargaining code and the important role of Australian journalism, news and public interest media in countering mis- and disinformation on digital platforms. The second interim report focuses specifically on Meta's decision, what this means for access to news in Australia, and the rise in mis- and disinformation on our democracy and society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date the committee has received 219 submissions plus additional information and answers to many questions on notice. We've held 10 public hearings and heard from a wide range of witnesses including from Meta, Snap, Google and TikTok, large and small news media providers—including digital only publishers—news media peak bodies, academics, organisations and individuals, and young people who provided the unique insights and experiences as digital natives. We've heard how social media has become an increasingly important source of access to news and public interest journalism for many Australians. For some, it is their only source. We have heard almost universally that access to accurate and timely news media is essential in maintaining a healthy democracy and in combating the rise of mis- and disinformation online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The news media bargaining code was established by the former coalition government. It was designed to be a mandatory code of conduct to govern commercial relationships between Australian news businesses and digital platforms. The code was designed to make big social media companies such as Meta, who owns both Facebook and Instagram—two of the world's most popular social media platforms—pay local news companies to carry their news. It was designed to help support the sustainability of public interest journalism in Australia, to provide Australians with access to quality online journalism and to address the significant bargaining power imbalance between digital platforms and Australian news businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard that funding from these deals, while sometimes inequitable between the small and large news organisations, nevertheless supported important news media jobs around Australia, including in regional and remote Australia's areas, where it is expensive to have local journalists employed. For some media organisations, deals made through this code have been a lifeline. But in February 2024 Meta announced that it will not be renewing commercial deals with Australian news media companies, deals worth millions of dollars, claiming that people don't come to their platforms for news anymore. This is despite evidence to the committee which was quite contrary to Meta's claims. We heard from multiple sources, including, most notably, the University of Canberra's 2024 <span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">igital news report</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: Australia</span>, which indicated that 49 per cent of Australians reported using social media as a source of news, and a remarkable 25 per cent reported it as their only source of news. When you look at gen Z audiences as a discrete cohort, 60 per cent of the gen Z respondents said that they relied on social media as their main source of news.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see there's a very different story from those with lived experience in the way they're getting news from the digital platforms and the stories that big tech companies might want to tell Australian people. Under the code, one option, to take action against Meta, would be to designate—that is, to subject it to obligations under the code—but some participants to the inquiry were very concerned that this would cause Meta to sidestep the code completely and refuse to carry news at all, as it has done in Canada. This has illustrated a fundamental flaw and problem with the code. Many participants, particularly those that represented small or social-media-only news organisations, expressed concern that designation and a decision to carry no news would see their businesses decimated, leaving a huge void for both mis- and disinformation to flourish. Despite this, the committee found that the News Media Bargaining Code has still been effective in encouraging financial arrangements, so this report does not advocate for the code to be abolished, at least not for now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, evidence clearly showed that further mechanisms are needed to secure the future of public interest journalism as social media companies evolve, and the government is already acting on this. The Albanese Labor government has recently announced a $15 million News Media Relief Program, which will provide grants to eligible regional, independent, suburban, multicultural and First Nations news providers creating news content. We know local and community news outlets play a vital role in keeping Australians up to date and informed. This News Media Relief Program is needed to support public interest journalism and safeguard media diversity in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go now to some of those recommendations in the report. The second interim report has made 11 considered recommendations aimed to address concerns raised during the inquiry about the News Media Bargaining Code and the sustainability of public interest journalism and digital media. These include exploring alternative revenue mechanisms to supplement the code as well as mechanisms and protocols to guide the fair and transparent distribution of any such revenue. There was a recommendation around establishing a short-term transition fund to help news media businesses to diversify and strengthen alternative income streams and news product offerings. There was a recommendation too around developing appropriate mechanisms and protocols to guide the fair and transparent distribution of revenue arising from any of those new revenue mechanisms which we referred to above.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another around establishing a digital media competency fund to enhance digital media literacy, not just of young Australians—although that was well noted throughout the report—but of many other vulnerable at-risk groups in our community, people who are at risk of mis- and disinformation. So increasing and enhancing digital media competency of all Australians is an ambition of this committee. In order to support legislation to combat mis- and disinformation, there was agreement that there was a need to, in fact, have a legislative response to what we see as one of the greatest threats to social harm and to our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another recommendation was about improving transparency around the digital platform systems and processes. We heard from many researchers about the need to be able to look under the hood, as they put it, to see what was really happening and to have access to that data, and to be able to make independent critical analysis of that work was not only important to the role of researchers in Australia but also important to informing government and all of us in this place and, indeed, our communities so that we're making informed decisions based on evidence about ways in which we might improve our regulatory frameworks and ways in which, let's face it, big tech companies might start improving their engagements with our community too. There was a recommendation to examine options to respond to the use of algorithms and the recommender systems to deprecate news by digital platforms with significant power. We've asked the government to look at what those options might be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're some of the main features of the recommendations from the committee, and, while the committee worked harmoniously throughout this inquiry, I am disappointed that the coalition's chosen to table a dissenting report. The news media bargaining code was an initiative of the former government—credit where credit's due. That was an important piece of legislation. It, in fact, had the support of all this parliament when it was carried. I need to be clear that this committee is not proposing to abolish that code, but the coalition's refusal to acknowledge the need for improvement alongside the need for tighter government regulation to combat serious harmful mis- and disinformation online is contrary to the evidence that we have received from the committee. We know that big tech is constantly evolving and that this means governments must also evolve and adapt. That's why this report recommends some changes to our regulatory frameworks, and the News Media Bargaining Code is just one of the measures at our disposal to hold big tech companies to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing that the coalition seems wedded to a set-and-forget approach to the code. That is never going to work, and I really hope that we're able to arrive at some sensible position in our next level of reporting to the parliament on our work. It's regretful that the committee therefore wasn't able to arrive at a consensus in this report as was the case when the News Media Bargaining Code came through the parliament and we were able to join together to support that. That was passed by the parliament back in 2021, as I said, with the support of the now government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are concerned about the impact that social media is having across many areas of the community, including access to accurate and reliable news content. This report highlights the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks to protect Australians from the harmful effects of social media. We, of course, want to make sure that all Australians are safe online, with a particular focus on ensuring that children are safe. Australians have the right to access high-quality news content on social media, which is what the 11 recommendations of this report reflect. Throughout the remainder of the inquiry, the committee will maintain its strong view that we need to hold big tech to account, that we need to have a solid legislative response to combat mis- and disinformation and that we need to better protect Australians and especially young Australians from social media harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry's final report is due to be tabled on or before 18 November. We will consider issues relating to online safety, algorithms and recommender systems, as well as impacts on the mental health of users, the lack of accountability of social media platforms and age assurance. These are important issues that the committee is taking very seriously.  Australians enjoy using social media, and we know it's not going anywhere, but we want to know that we are all safe online and that what we are reading and seeing in the news is accurate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay special thanks to the secretariat who continues to work hard to look to table the final report in just a few weeks. Thanks to the committee secretary, Gerry McInally, Aysha Osborne, Michael Perks, Aisha Bottrill and Jamison Eddington in particular. I thank all members of the committee. I can see that I'm joined in the House by the member for Goldstein, who is a very active participant, and I thank her for her insights and camaraderie in work before the committee. I want to give a shout-out to the deputy chair from the other house, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, for her collaborative approach to working on some of the most significant problems facing the Australian people today. I look forward to the committee working constructively together in this final stage of our inquiry and reporting back to this House in the very near future.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  by leave—In addition to the chair's comments, the Joint Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society's second interim report represents how Australia's approach to regulating digital platforms is outdated and begins to show where it's headed. 'Online safety' as a term is often used to describe the scope of the policy space this committee was charged with examining, but many don't have an appreciation for how broad the risk of harm online can be. Some of these risks are immediately obvious; many are less perceptible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Online safety encompasses mental health, democratic division, online scams, gendered violence and data privacy. But there are adjacent harms that receive less media and popular attention: loneliness and social atomization, internet addiction and choosing to spend increasing amounts of time at home 'doomscrolling' instead of socialising and making friendships in the 'real world'. The transformation of social norms and behaviour is at an unprecedented pace due to the sheer speed at which information travels online. The breadth of these risks warrants a governmental response which is correspondingly broad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 1 of the committee's second interim report calls for the government to establish a digital affairs ministry, which would have overarching responsibility for the challenges and risks relating to digital platforms. Currently, each of the risks I mentioned earlier is segmented across multiple ministerial portfolios. We need coordination across these portfolios—a ministry empowered to make decisions that can encompass the full breadth of risks represented by online safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendations 2 and 3 of the interim report propose alternative revenue mechanisms, often referred to as a 'digital platform levy' or a 'big tax'. Revenue could be allocated to support the long-term sustainability of Australian public interest journalism by using a levy of this kind. Considering the issues related to the News Media Bargaining Code, which this report is directed at, this is worthwhile. I also suggest that some of this funding go towards the establishment of an independent body to oversee how big tech systems and processes are operating in Australia. Such a body could be used to accredit researchers and to mediate between them and the digital platforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is precedent for these ideas. Models of how this could work were floated during the design of the European Union's Digital Services Act, which in many ways is the trailblazer in this space. It's critical to note, though, that a tax alone is not enough to achieve meaningful accountability of the digital platforms. Such a mechanism would raise revenue, but it would not compel big tech to change the way algorithms, systems and processes function in any way, which is why recommendation 9 is so important. Here, the committee calls for transparency requirements, like those in the EU Digital Services Act. The DSA, enacted in 2022, represents a step change in best practice digital platform regulation and eclipses the scope of our content focused Online Safety Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Europe, digital platforms under article 40 must open their algorithms to accredited public interest researchers to conduct research. And last week Europe announced how article 40 will work under regulation. Australia's lack of legal protections has resulted in a researcher brain drain to Europe. Experts are deterred from conducting research into algorithms here due to the threat of legal liability. Just look to the United States, for example. Elon Musk has described bodies like the Centre for Countering Digital Hate as criminal organisations and has updated X's terms of service to reflect that sentiment. Transparency measures such as these do not have to be partisan. Indeed, the coalition's dissenting response to the second interim report demonstrates the multipartisan nature of algorithmic transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw the House's attention to recommendation 11, which, in a way, lies at the heart of the Australian government's approach to regulation of digital platforms to date. Australia's model of industry coregulation has been described as the 'best and quickest form of regulation'. Quick it may be, but that is meaningless if the regulation it produces has no teeth. Boiled down, coregulation amounts to 'you must show up to the negotiating table' but what you negotiate is your business. I encourage the government to adopt this recommendation and review whether this regulatory approach will serve us in the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Bondi stabbings and Wakeley church attack have taught us one thing, it's that Australia's existing regime is not working. It's time to up our ambition and align our Online Safety Act to international best practice. I would add that discourse around age prohibition is not a meaningful or long-term solution. It's time that we reigned in the algorithms and stood up to big tech, and the second interim report's recommendations are a start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I agree with the comments of the chair, the member for Newcastle, that it's unfortunate the coalition elected to table a dissenting report in this instance. It would be far better if we could agree in a multipartisan fashion on what is a very important area of public policy in this country. It is very front much of mind for a lot of Australians. We have a couple of weeks before we'll deliver the final report, and I would hope that we can negotiate a unanimous position on that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  'Public ownership': two simple words but they mean so much, particularly for those of us on this side of the chamber. The NBN is one of Labor's greatest achievements, so it's only right that Labor introduces this bill to ensure it remains in public ownership. Indeed, on one level, it is lamentable that this bill even needs to be introduced in the first place. Given the importance of the NBN to all Australians, keeping it in public ownership really should be non-controversial, but we know only too well the form those opposite have on matters such as these. They have a long and sorry history of being the enemy of public ownership. Given half a chance, they would sell the NBN off in a jiffy to a foreign interest or the highest bidder, placing the interest of everyday Australians a poor second to corporate greed. Worse still, such a move could potentially compromise our national sovereignty and security, so it's timely this matter comes before us to ensure the public ownership of the NBN into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of the availability to all Australians of the NBN was evident during COVID. Families in Werriwa were struggling with accessibility and availability when everyone was suddenly working and being educated at home. Public ownership will ensure that the government can make the NBN available to all Australians. The Albanese government is 100 per cent committed to keeping the NBN in public ownership. This government is ensuring that modern, accessible and affordable communication services are available for all Australians without the ongoing threat of privatisation. Further, public ownership will ensure ongoing regulatory oversight of the NBN wholesale pricing, keeping broadband affordable for all Australians. When cost-of-living pressures are front and centre, the last thing Australians need to face is monopoly powers forcing up the price of broadband services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 to ensure as an explicit requirement that the NBN will be preserved in public ownership. It will do this by removing the current conditions for terminating government ownership of the NBN by repealing most of part 3 of the NBN act. Labor's commitment to this end should come as no surprise given our commitment through the statement of expectations issued in 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN is without doubt one of Australia's most important pieces of infrastructure, especially in an age with cybersecurity and national security imperatives. Australians are taking up fibre upgrades in record numbers, and the fibre and fixed wireless upgrades we took to the 2022 election are being delivered on time and on budget—a first. Coupled with exciting innovations in satellite technology, we really are at the cusp of transforming connectivity for everyone. This is great news for all Australians, particularly those in regional communities. It's therefore crucial to ensure that the NBN has strong government oversight, and that's best achieved through the ongoing government ownership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the House in recent times. It is important for all the right reasons. It is important because it demonstrates this government's commitment to the public ownership of one of our nation's most important pieces of infrastructure. It is important because it will ensure all Australians, especially those in regional Australia, will have first-class connectivity at an affordable price. It is important as it will protect Australia's national interest from foreign ownership and monopolies. It is important because it puts the interest of Australians unashamedly first. I commend the bill to the House and thank the minister for bringing the matter forward.</span>

I was so excited because so many constituents in my electorate have challenges with the National Broadband Network, and I thought that having a bill dealing with the National Broadband Network would be a great opportunity to address some of those challenges that people have—the Australians who have been left behind who have an inability to connect to the NBN. I thought that was what this bill would be all about. That is certainly the urgent issue with relation to the NBN in my community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then I read the bill. I looked at it closely, and I saw that actually it didn't do any of those things. This bill, rather than addressing those things, is a political stunt. It's a symptom of a government that has run out of ideas and run out of puff. There's no agenda in this bill to reform the NBN and no agenda here to help Australians who have been left behind. This bill is a bill to save the Labor Party from the Labor Party. It's a bill to stop the privatisation of the NBN, the sale of which was contemplated by the Labor Party at the time they were in government in the Gillard years. It was Minister Conroy who said in his press release of 22 November 2010, 'The Gillard government remains firmly committed to selling its stake in the NBN Co after the network was fully built and operational, subject to market conditions and security considerations.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The now Prime Minister was the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport at the time the bill was presented, and it's interesting reading his speech on the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010, where he said that the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… also sets out arrangements for the eventual sale of the Commonwealth's stake in the company once the NBN rollout is complete, including provisions for independent and parliamentary reviews prior to any privatisation, and for the parliament to have the final say on the sale. The bill also creates a power for the Governor-General to make regulations concerning future private ownership and control of NBN Co. Ltd, and establishes other relevant reporting, governance and enforcement mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Albanese, as he then was, goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no longer a requirement that NBN Co. Ltd must be sold within five years of it being declared built and fully operational. Rather the time frame for any sale is left to the judgment of the government and parliament of the day, enabling due regard to the role the NBN is playing, market conditions and any other relevant factors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of selling the NBN was very much a Labor idea at the time that the NBN bills were first enacted. So the idea that this is being put forward is quite strange to me. You have to remember the genesis of the NBN was very much a slapdash effort on behalf of the then government. Minister Conroy, as he then was, had to fly around on the prime ministerial plane to get the Prime Minister's attention, and he put the idea of the NBN on the back of a napkin, famously. That's how this all started. So it is unsurprising that, yet again, another idea developed on the back of a napkin, which is this bill, is being presented to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a political scare from the Labor Party, who has run out of ideas and sought to play politics. We've seen them run these sorts of scares before. We saw it in the 2016 election with 'Mediscare'. This bill is 'telescare'. It's an idea that somehow there are people who want to privatise the NBN and it must be stopped. But it's rubbish. This bill is a complete scare and a complete scam. It's like the scams you get when you're texted or called by people from around the world, except what makes this so tragic is that this is legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's next from this government? Are we going to get a bill for an act to prevent the privatisation of His Majesty the King? That would be 'monarch scare'. Are we going to get a bill for an act to prevent the privatisation of this parliament? That would be 'parliscare'. Or are we going to get a bill for an act to prevent the privatisation of the ADF? That would be 'digger scare'. This is symptomatic of a government that has run out of ideas and run out of puff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that people are deserting the NBN in droves. People in my community, particularly, are deserting the NBN in droves. We know this because of the satellite figures. NBN satellite figures show it is down to 85,000 customers. Starlink, its major competitor—a heroic company to many people in my community who could not connect to the NBN but have opted to go with Starlink—is now at 270,000 customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't need to believe me when I say this bill does absolutely nothing. You can believe the minister herself in her second reading speech on this bill, where she said, 'This bill would not change the operation of the NBN.' It does nothing to make people's lives better and it does nothing to make people's service better in relation to the NBN. She also said, 'Since the government has no intention to sell the NBN, there's no requirement for a legislative sale scheme.' So, given the government has got no intention to sell the NBN, why are we wasting precious parliamentary time on these things? This is a Seinfeld bill. It's a bill about nothing from a Seinfeld government—a government about nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about some of the real challenges Australians are facing today with the NBN that should be the subject of this bill. They are challenges that I have raised with this minister repeatedly since this government came to office, in 2022. I have to say the minister has been very polite and listened to me and so on, but we haven't got the action. So there are still people in my community who are dealing with inadequate NBN services, which is making their lives very difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the minister as early as 22 August 2022, asking her to look at upgrades and different technology choices for the people who are at Knights Road, Galston, at Fuggles Road and Orana Road, Kenthurst, and at Dural East, all of whom had said that the technology solution that had been proposed for them was inadequate because they were on fixed wireless and they were looking for fixed line. I'll explain why fixed wireless was inadequate. It's particularly because of the topography of those areas in my electorate and because of the tree canopy, which make the fixed wireless service the wrong sort of service. What we were looking for were more place based solutions, which would have been available—had the Morrison government been re-elected—as part of the regional telecommunications report which was led by Luke Hartsuyker and which had a particular focus on peri-urban communications in electorates like mine around Australia. So I met with the minister shortly thereafter, and I went back to her again a year later to describe some of the issues that still remained in relation to the NBN in my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to tell the House about some of the issues that I raised with the minister—issues which are still unresolved today. The lack of consistency and the quality of coverage across various NBN technologies has impacted people's lives in my community in terms of their needs, like doing schoolwork, and accessing medical services and technology. My electorate has all three NBN technologies: fixed line, fixed wireless and satellite. Consumers largely don't have a say in which technology is delivered, but the quality of service they get is radically different. The peri-urban areas of the electorate experience the worst communication issues, and many of them have reported being unable to complete schooling, to run local businesses or to access medical services and being cut off from communications. Key issues with the NBN that contribute are constant slow speeds and performance, inability to connect, planned and unplanned dropouts, degrading infrastructure and unreliable communications with telcos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a Third World country. This isn't some remote location in Australia; this is metropolitan Sydney. I talked about Knights Road, Galston. In that area, the residents are served by fixed wireless. As I said, the topography and the tree coverage makes that technology an inappropriate choice for the NBN. Residents who couldn't connect through fixed wireless were told to use satellite but couldn't connect. The lack of telecommunications infrastructure was exemplified by the resident with the tower for the fixed wireless service on her property being unable to connect to the NBN. At my urgings, NBN then organised their top technician to visit the property and examine the situation. The resulting examination confirmed that they couldn't connect to the NBN at their own property. This is what people in my community are dealing with, and this is why we need an NBN bill that actually deals with some of these issues—not these political stunts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to tell the House the story of Northholm Grammar, one of the great schools of my electorate. Northholm Grammar at Arcadia is heavily impacted by poor telecommunications. Presently—and we're talking 2024 now—there is no NBN technology available to them that would allow them to operate effectively, as the fixed wireless that's available to them would not meet the school's needs. Many areas of the school, including primary school classrooms, have zero mobile coverage. This presents significant challenges for staff and students and, additionally, is a major safety issue. Teaching and administrative work are heavily impacted by poor internet connection, and this is currently the primary focus of the school board and the wider school community, as it heavily hinders the standard of education that the children are receiving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent service providers have advised Northholm Grammar that the school needs a 1,000 megabits up/1,000 megabits down link in order to operate effectively and that this should be delivered over a reliable technology, such as fibre. But, currently, the fastest plan available on the NBN is 75 megabits per second up and 10 megabits per second down. The school has outsourced and connected via a private ISP but is only getting 200 up/200 down as a connection. The minister knows these problems because I raised them with her more than a year ago, but we've seen no action, and those problems continue today. They continue in other areas as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government is spending more time trying to create a distraction around the NBN rather than addressing the issues my constituents are facing, this government's politicking has taken precedence over delivery of fixing issues, and I hear about them almost every day. Take Chris from Castle Hill, for example. Chris has experienced nine interruptions over a one-month period from 6 November to 5 December last year. His wife also had her business disrupted when her office internet and phone were cut off. My office raised the issue with Telstra, who advised it was an NBN issue and recommended that we contact the NBN. The NBN then recommended that Chris contact Telstra and go through them. It's the classic bureaucratic runaround that so many Australians get with the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Ron from Berowra Heights, who had his house disconnected from the NBN last year to allow for building works. Ron was then unable to have it reconnected. He inquired with Telstra and the NBN multiple times to ask that he be connected, only to be told he was connected. This wasn't the case. A technician was meant to attend his house on 28 February but never attended. This government committed to customer service, yet what have we seen? A real lack of it, despite us raising these issues with the minister and with NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alfons lives in Galston. He contacted Telstra to have the NBN connected to his property. When they arrived, NBN were unable to install the service. They were unable to decide how and where to install the service. One side of the property had too many trees and the other was too close to the solar panels. After they checked everywhere on the property, all services to the local tower were declared poor services. This is not an issue his neighbours, all of whom have more trees on their properties and already have fixed wireless installed, have faced. NBN has now listed the property as satellite only, and Telstra is unable to assist due to this. Alfons wants NBN to check the other towers in the area but is unable to contact NBN, and Telstra is unable to assist due to the 'satellite only' label.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are real problems that real Australians are facing while we're debating this <span style="font-style:italic;">Seinfeld</span> bill. This government is spending time putting together a bill for a political fight instead of fixing the problems in my community and trying to help people like Barbara from Arcadia. Barbara's family home is stuck on dial-up internet that drops out multiple times a day. They have four mobile phones in their house, and all need internet to get mobile connection. Barbara is unable to access 4G in her own home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the minister might spend some time working to solve the issues of Alan in Cherrybrook. Alan has internet disruptions, so he contacted his internet provider, who advised the issue was with NBN. When my office reached out to the NBN, they were advised that it wasn't an NBN issue and that, if it was, Alan should go through his provider, who would then contact NBN. Rabbit holes are the only way that NBN seems to deal with these issues, and ultimately the government, as owner of NBN, is responsible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's lack of commitment to delivering the NBN is slowing down people's education. For instance, David had his NBN cut and was unable to get an alternative service through his provider, who scheduled NBN to install a connection. Due to David's location at Berowra Waters, the NBN refused to attend and cited a lack of commercial access and site safety concerns. David was himself willing to hire a barge or a water taxi to resolve the problem. David has had to purchase Starlink services to gain access to the internet but is struggling with access due to the cliff in his back yard blocking access. He is now attempting to lift the antenna higher in order to gain internet access. David relies on the internet to do his university course, as Australians who are studying all over this country do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When my constituents next get in touch with me about the issues they're having with the NBN, I'll remind them this government is committed to political bills like this one and wasting this parliament's time rather than fixing their issues. There are real challenges that our community faces with the NBN, particularly in my community of Berowra and throughout the peri-urban areas where the NBN connection is inadequate and where the quality of service that NBN is providing to those people who want to upgrade their connection is completely absent. We need a government that is serious about ensuring that all Australians have access to the NBN and is focusing this parliament's time, as it should be focused, on improving the access of Australians rather than on political stunts like this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on the National Broadband Network Companies Amendment (Commitment to Public Ownership) Bill 2024. When I listen to the member for Berowra, it's almost as if those nine terrible years of the coalition government never happened. Their policy was to demolish the NBN. In 2010, they actually put out a policy that poured scorn on the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ross Pratt, a local businessman up in Esk, saw me at the Toogoolawah State High School awards night and raised an issue concerning the future of the NBN under the coalition. He said: 'The NBN was a transformative initiative for Australia's IT sector. Unfortunately, under the previous communications minister Malcolm Turnbull, later Prime Minister, the project was mismanaged, resulting in a far inferior product. The decision to rely on outdated copper cabling already beyond its life span was shortsighted. This choice burdened taxpayers with unnecessary costs and delivered a network that is struggling to meet the country's needs.' I say amen to that, Ross. You absolutely got it in a country area like that. Esk, of course, would have had fibre to the premises, being a country town, but those opposite refused to go ahead with fibre to the premises. I'm going to give a bit of a history lesson because the member for Berowra needs a history lesson after that sort of speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rudd government announced it would bypass the existing copper network. Do you remember that word 'copper'? The coalition put their faith in copper. We said we would bypass the copper network and construct a new national network combining fibre-to-the-premises, fixed-wireless and satellite technologies. The fibre-to-the-premises rollout planned to reach approximately 93 per cent of premises in Australia by June 2021. Unfortunately, we lost the 2013 election. Fibre to the premises was to replace the copper network but the coalition, of course, never agreed to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010, the coalition took their communications policy to that election and it was described as ‘undercooked’. They pledged just $6 billion and were going to wind up the NBN and sell it off. That was their policy in 2010. I remember Andrew Robb, the finance minister at the time, saying that the Labor government was betting the house on a single technology. They backed it up in 2013 with then opposition leader, Tony Abbott, and then opposition spokesperson for communications, Malcolm Turnbull. Malcolm Turnbull was given the responsibility 'to demolish the NBN'. Those opposite argued that the demand for telecommunication services would not be very significant. They poured scorn on the idea, ran a few videos, and that was basically what they thought. That was the degree of digital understanding and literacy of those opposite had during their time in opposition. Then, when they got into government, they announced the same thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, the coalition announced that the NBN would deliver a mix of old and new technologies, a multitechnology mix, and Malcolm Turnbull was talking about this all the time. They completely botched it up. It blew out. We ended up with an inferior product, as Ross Pratt, the local businessman who works in this area of computing in Esk said, and we on this side had to fix it up. Just before the last election, those opposite realised they had failed, so they announced a bit more money to start rolling out fibre to the premises. So I won't cop any lectures and sermons from those opposite on the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is about making sure the NBN is owned by the Australian people. We want to make sure they have fast, reliable and affordable internet now and into the future. Whether you are in Esk, where Ross is working, or in Ipswich in my electorate, we want to make sure students have the capacity to access the information they need for their assignments and exams, we want businesses to run productively and we want videoconferencing for patients to receive telehealth services. That is critical for regional and rural areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always been bemused and befuddled by the LNP members in Queensland, who know very well telecommunications are so critical to rural Queensland. Yet when they got in, they kowtowed to the far right of the Liberal Party and decided they were not going to go and do it. But what got me was that the bloke who claimed he invented the internet, Malcolm Turnbull, was also the bloke who tried to destroy the NBN. We on this side are not going to let any of that happen. We are not. We want to make sure the NBN is owned by those people to whom it belongs—the Australian public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have done a number of things. First, we have invested $2.4 billion to expand the full-fibre NBN access to 1.5 million additional premises, including 660,000 in rural and regional communities. Those opposite did not do any of that when they were in, none of it, yet they purport to adequately represent those communities. Second, from September next year, we are boosting download speeds by up to five times the current speeds at no extra wholesale cost. Thirdly, we are rolling out more fibre in the fixed-line network, upgrading the fixed-wireless network and planning for the future needs of regional communities like mine. We are keeping NBN in public hands and we are going to lock in an affordable and accessible high speed. It is critical infrastructure. It was at the time the biggest infrastructure program any Australian government had done. The NBN is so important, reaching over 12.4 million premises across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New figures out clearly show more than nine million homes and businesses are now able to access the fastest broadband speeds on the NBN. This is an important milestone. It's important because faster speeds provide a world-class experience for consumers, whether they're connected for work, study or entertainment. We know the average data usage in Australia has increased 10 times over the past 10 years, with the average home now hosting 22 internet-connected or smart devices. That's why it's possible to do this; it's critical to do it. Research shows the NBN has delivered $122 billion in economic uplift since 2022 and supported the creation of 169,000 jobs, the equivalent of a 1.3 per cent increase in our labour force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, communities like mine told us that the job of upgrading the NBN was not complete, and I got that just last week when I was at the Somerset Regional Council meeting with the mayor and the councillors up there. Australians simply don't trust the coalition not to flog off the NBN as was their policy previously in opposition, as they did with Telstra. They just don't. This bill will ensure the NBN continues to deliver to all Australians, providing digital inclusion and price certainty for industry and consumers. We're delivering on our election commitments, including in my electorate. As Australia's connectivity needs continue to grow, we're going to need faster and better NBN. We're keeping the NBN in public hands because we want to make sure that we look after consumers. A monopoly power and private hands is not the way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to give a quick overview of the bill. The bill will amend the National Broadband Network Companies Act to ensure that ongoing public ownership is required. The bill incorporates that because we're wanting to make it clear that the NBN preserved in public ownership is an explicit requirement, and it will remove the current conditions for terminating government ownership by repealing part 3 of the act. The Albanese government's committed to keeping NBN in public ownership already through an updated statement of expectations issued in December 2022, confirming the government's commitment and policy position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes a commitment in terms of a legislative framework. The bill removes existing legislative conditions which would allow the privatisation of the company. Ongoing government ownership of the NBN will keep wholesale broadband prices more affordable for consumers than if the company was in private ownership. The government will support a strong regulatory oversight of the NBN and a special access undertaking with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to cap wholesale prices. What's more, we're delivering the fibre and fixed wireless upgrades we took to the 2024 election on time and on budget, which is effectively a first for any government in this area. This is very important for my electorate in Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland is the most decentralised mainland state, with about half our population living outside the capital of Brisbane and south-east corner with a lot of regional and remote communities including in my electorate. My electorate is both outer suburban and regional and takes in the majority of Ipswich, one of the fastest-growing regions in the country, the Karana Downs region and the rural Somerset region including rural Ipswich as well. For my constituents, having access to fast, reliable quality internet is not a luxury; it's a 21st-century critical capacity and necessity. This is precisely why, before the election, we committed to investing $2.4 billion to expand that fibre access I referred to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to that commitment, large parts of Ipswich, the Karana Downs area and the Somerset region as well as surrounding areas like the South Burnett and the Lockyer Valley are now able to join the 21st century and upgrade to full-fibre broadband connection. Indeed, more than 34,000 families and small businesses in Blair can now access superfast internet thanks to our strong investment in the network. These long-suffering families and small businesses have had to settle for the coalition's dodgy copper network until now. In contrast, world-class fibre broadband means faster upload and download speeds and a more reliable connection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just make this point: if you were to go from Karana Downs to the north all the way down towards Ripley and right through the middle of Ipswich, which is one of the most densely concentrated parts of Queensland with a population of 260,000 people, under the coalition, you wouldn't get fibre to the premises; you would get fibre to the node. It's just slightly better than ADSL 2, all through the middle of Ipswich. It goes to show the contempt the coalition had for my community. In contrast, we are getting fibre to the premises in these areas. We're committing to making sure that so many parts of my electorate that didn't get access to it are upgraded. Areas that can't access full fibre network upgrades will get satellite and will transition from satellite to fixed wireless for the first time, thanks to a $480 million investment to improve broadband connectivity in the bush. As part of this, 14 locations in rural Ipswich and surrounding areas, like the Lockyer Valley and Scenic Rim, and 13 locations in the Somerset region—more than 20 per cent of the total 120,000 premises that are eligible—will be able to move to a fixed wireless connection by December this year. This means fast and more consistent speeds for families and small businesses in these rural areas, as well as access to high-speed plans. We've also installed a backup NBN Sky Muster satellite service in Kilcoy in the upper Somerset region in the northern end of my electorate to boost internet quality in the area. This vital infrastructure will help build this community and help them stay connected during a natural disaster, which is so critical because all these country towns get cut off during floods. It could be the difference between life and death, and it certainly is the difference in terms of the viability of businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is working across the NBN network to move from fixed line to fixed wireless and satellite technologies to deliver quality communications infrastructure in my community and in the various country towns across my electorate. We're delivering on our plan for a better NBN. It's essential for the positive vision my constituents voted for at the last election. As I said, last week, I met with the Somerset Regional Council, who were very interested to know how telecommunications upgrades were progressing. We wanted to put fibre to the premises in all these country towns, and we aspire to doing that. They were part of the thousand rural communities and country towns that had fibre to the premises taken away by those opposite when they won the election in 2013. So what we're doing here is a game changer for our regions, and we're supporting it. We know small businesses start up in these areas. After that meeting with the council that I referred to, I went to the Brisbane Valley Roasters in Esk where I grabbed a takeaway coffee and talked to a few people there, including one of the local police officers. We've seen people for the first time being able to access internet speeds that allow them to study online. That's why Ross Pratt in Esk is so correct with his computer knowledge and his business in that community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a nation-building investment, ensuring that more people in Ipswich and the Somerset region and the Karana Downs area get access to the full opportunities the digital economy has to offer. So, in terms of hearing speeches from the member for Berowra and others, I say that they should have a look at history and at the failures of Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, during their nine years, to get it right. They should look at the blowouts, their addiction to anything other than fibre to the premises and their obsession with copper. They may as well have been committed to a Model T Ford, in terms of digital technology. That's what those opposite were addicted to. They really failed monumentally. There's a massive divide between us and them in this area. They completely and utterly failed during their nine years, so for them to give us lectures and sermons on our perceived or alleged failing is a complete waste of time and a denial of the fact and the reality and, certainly, the experience of history.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  In the time I had before the debate on the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024 was interrupted on 10 October, I was making the point that the coalition values, as it should, the role that early childhood educators and childcare workers play in the education of our youngest students. That is why the coalition certainly doesn't stand in the way of a wage rise for early childhood educators and teachers. But of course we do have some very real concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those concerns, from my electorate's perspective, deal with issues around accessibility of child care, but I'll speak to those issues a little later. What I want to do is highlight some of the headline concerns. I spoke to the first issue before debate was interrupted, which is that this increase, whilst welcomed, is slated to cease on 30 November 2026. So it does beg the question that I asked previously: what happens after 2026? What happens beyond that date? It's a very important question and it's one that hasn't been resolved by those opposite. In fairness, it ought to be. I don't think we should regard this as anything other than a pre-election sugar hit unless that question is resolved by giving the detail around it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second principal concern I have with this is I don't understand why, in a situation where we're looking to provide early childhood educators and childcare workers a wage increase, this has to be effected, if you like, via a workplace instrument. We live in the real world and the reality is the reason why it's being effected by a workplace instrument and why a workplace instrument needs to be in place for a service to access this grant funding is this is in an effort to appease unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a sense the Albanese Labor government is covertly attempting, by stealth, to unionise the early childhood sector. That is completely unnecessary and feeds to this suggestion that, again, this is not only a pre-election sugar hit but it's also about growing the size of the unionised workforce in the country—a workforce which, left to its own devices, is becoming a small fraction of the working population in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next concern I've got with this approach is the troubling habit we're now seeing from those opposite. I've made the point that all educators do incredibly valuable work and of course we want them to be better paid for the work they do. And we in the coalition want to see higher real wages, but that's the point. It's real wages that we're focused on; higher real wages for hardworking childhood educators and, in fact, higher real wages for all Australians. But the key to meaningful wage increases isn't sugar hits like the one contained in this bill. It's about doing the hard work to bring down inflation and to boost labour productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear those opposite have given up the fight to bring downward pressure on inflation and boost labour productivity.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PASIN:</span>
                    </a>  My friend opposite scoffs, but every day they come into this place and almost every measure is effectively targeted towards driving up the cost of everything, whether it is energy policy or industrial relations policy. Perhaps those opposite—the member interjecting in particular—might want to reflect on the real cost to Australian families of 12 consecutive interest rate increases. I would have thought the Queensland election not 10 days ago might have been an opportunity for those opposite to get real-world feedback, but of course they haven't. That's fine. Let's proceed through to March, because I think in March there will be some more real-world feedback for those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about childcare deserts. In my electorate there are many places where, it doesn't matter how much you are prepared to pay for child care, there is no child care. There are other places where child care is provided one half-day a fortnight and it's delivered out of the boot of a car. It's completely unacceptable. Those opposite have spent two years tinkering with the arrangements for child care, increasing subsidies for those who can put their children in child care and now increasing notional wages. Of course, that's not in real terms but in notional terms. It has done nothing—not one additional place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I've had the pleasure and the privilege of being the member for Barker, this has become a real issue. It's increasingly an issue in regional communities. And so what have I done? We've always tried to find solutions. In the community of Southern Mallee, in Lameroo and Pinnaroo, there was no childcare service. In the course of the last term, the coalition government, together with the Southern Mallee District Council, with my advocacy, were able to build not one but two childcare facilities in the communities of Lameroo and Pinnaroo. How did we do it? We took drought funding. As a community they decided that the No. 1 priority in their community in the midst of a drought was to build childcare facilities. You might think for a moment think: is there an obvious connection between drought funding and child care? But if you live in a rural community you'll understand it. One of the best ways to drought-proof your farming enterprise is to create off-farm income. In many of these communities, one or other of the parents was required to stay at home on duty because there was no opportunity for child care. Not in all cases but in a lot of these cases professional women were at home caring for children in circumstances where the broader community was screaming for people to join or re-enter the workforce—as nurses at local hospitals, teachers at local schools, farm contractors, you name it. That's what we've seen at those facilities. We've seen those facilities built. They are run by the Southern Mallee District Council. As a result, many people have been able to re-enter the workforce. It was not just those communities. The community of Karoonda did similar, building a childcare facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These communities ought not to have to rely on ad hoc and occasional grant funds to achieve these outcomes, not when the Commonwealth is spending such significant sums in and around child care. What we need to see is a set of policies that not only address affordability and questions around employment and ensuring there are enough childcare workers and early educators. We need policies that are focused on addressing the childcare deserts, because it's not right that people in my electorate don't enjoy the same sort of support that people in rural cities like the one I come from or indeed the capital cities like colleagues sitting opposite come from enjoy. That's what we need. We need a balanced approach to the question of child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am reminded that, where we have the resources, we need to balance them appropriately. I come from the great state of South Australia. Not many people know this, but South Australia has the greatest dichotomy in the world—not in Australia, but in the world—between the number of its citizens living in a capital city relative to its next largest city. That's 1.3 or so million people in Adelaide and 25,000 or so people living in my hometown of Mount Gambier. It speaks to the difference for South Australia, in particular, of that disparate population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I come from Mount Gambier, with a population of 25,000 people, I also represent communities and local councils that have as few as a thousand ratepayers. I mentioned two in my contribution: the Southern Mallee District Council and the District Council of Karoonda East Murray. These councils are leaning into child care not because they're appropriately resourced to but because they have to. I call out to those opposite—and I say this on the basis that these councils often have very large road assets in very broad council areas but with a very small population basis—if it's good enough and important enough and high enough a priority for those very small councils, like the government authorities in my electorate, to make accessibility of child care a priority, which isn't a traditional responsibility of local government, then it's got to be good enough for those opposite to take responsibility for governing for all Australians seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite were governing for all Australians, then they wouldn't be doing the bidding of the union movement in this bill. Instead, they would be thinking deeply about what remote, regional and rural Australians need as well. I fear that those opposite increasingly don't have anywhere near the front of their minds, in policy debates or considerations, the concerns, the wants and, in this case, the needs of rural, regional and remote Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  This bill is not only timely, or, arguably, well overdue, but critical for the future of our early childhood education sector and, by extension, the wellbeing of our society as a whole. This bill will provide much-needed wage support for early childhood education and care workers across the country. These professionals, who provide important education services and support to our younger citizens, have been underpaid, underappreciated and overworked for far too long. It's high time we address this injustice and recognise the value of their contribution not only to our children's development but also to our broader economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a truth universally acknowledged and often said in this place that caring for children is the most important job you can do. Early childhood education and care workers are at the forefront of shaping the next generation. Gross motor skills, fine motor skills, cognitive development, emotional regulation, socialisation—research consistently shows that the first five years of a child's life are critical to their cognitive, emotional, physical and social development. These early experiences lay the foundation for success in school and in life. When children are nurtured, cared for and educated by qualified professionals during this formative period, they are more likely to grow up to be productive, confident and engaged members of our society. Yet, despite the clear evidence of the importance of early childhood education, we continue to undervalue the work of those who dedicate their lives in this field. Early childhood educators, the majority women, are paid significantly less than other workers with equivalent qualifications, often struggling to make ends meet. It is unacceptable that the people who help raise and educate our children are forced to contend with financial insecurity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early childhood work is challenging but it's a rewarding career, and we want it to be a career of choice. We want graduates to choose to work with young children and to choose to put their skills to use to give these children the best possible start to their education and their future lives. We want them to stay in the sector knowing they have a long, satisfying and financially rewarding career ahead of them, not, as currently happens, to leave the sector because they cannot afford to support themselves and their families on the low wages. This bill seeks to right this wrong by creating a funding mechanism to support better wages for these essential workers. Decent wages are critical to reversing attrition and growing the workforce. But, more than that, this is vital to the sustainability of the sector. Early childhood education services have been delaying expansion plans, closing rooms, limiting enrolments and not expanding because they can't find qualified staff. This is impacting the availability of early childhood education and care for families across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago the Productivity Commission released a report that said that building the workforce is the first step to increasing access to ECEC for families. The wage justice bill will help address significant workforce shortages by supporting the delivery of a wage increase of 15 per cent for eligible workers over two years. A typical early childhood educator will receive an additional $103 a week from December 2024, increasing to at least $155 a week from December 2025. A typical early childhood teacher will receive an additional $166 a week from December 2024, increasing to at least $249 a week from December 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wage justice bill also establishes terms and conditions of the ECEC worker retention payment grant, including a limit on fee increases that can be charged by providers. I know that the possibility of fee rises is a concern to parents and families, so I want to reiterate this point: the bill establishes a limit on fee increases. This will put downward pressure on fees, helping to make child care more affordable for more families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wage justice bill also encourages good faith bargaining and the making of enterprise agreements in the early childhood education and care sector. It will also help support the steps the government has already taken to make ECEC cheaper for Australian families. Paying ECEC workers fairly is a crucial step in charting the course to universal accessibility of early childhood education and care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also significant economic reasons to support this bill. A strong, well-compensated early childhood education workforce contributes to the overall strength of the economy. By ensuring that parents have access to affordable, high-quality childcare, we enable more people to participate in the workforce, particularly women, who are often the primary caregivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we invest in early childhood education, we are investing in workforce participation, productivity and economic growth. But, beyond economic factors, this bill is about fairness. Early childhood educators do not provide babysitting services. They are highly trained professionals who deliver complex, emotionally demanding and intellectually stimulating services. Their work is vital to the wellbeing of children who are, after all, the future of our country. When we here have retired, these children are the people who will be caring for us in the healthcare or aged-care sectors, building infrastructure, managing the banking system, growing our food, making export commodities and much more. It is in all of our interests that these children are well-educated, and it's time we recognised the important role of early childhood educators in the future of our country. You recognise important work through fair compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to note that underpaid workers are more likely to leave the profession, contributing to high turnover rates and staff shortages. This instability undermines the quality of care provided to children and places additional stress on remaining workers. By increasing wages, we can help stabilise the workforce, reduce turnover and improve the overall quality of early childhood education and care services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also speaks to the issue of gender equality. As I mentioned earlier, the early childhood education workforce is overwhelmingly female, with women making up over 95 per cent of the sector. The low wages in this field are a reflection of the broader issue of gender based pay inequality, where work traditionally associated with women is undervalued and underpaid. Supporting wage increases in early childhood education is a crucial step forward to addressing gender pay disparities and recognising the true value of work in female dominated professions. As one worker said to me, 'It's not pin money; it's my career.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we often talk about closing the gender pay gap, and here is a concrete opportunity to do so. This government has managed to achieve the lowest ever gender pay gap, of just 11.5 per cent, and that hasn't happened by accident; it has happened because of targeted, deliberate policies such as this one—policies targeted at increasing wages in low paid, female dominated sectors—along with other strategies such as tax cuts being for all Australians, not just those on high wages; paid domestic violence leave; and an extension of paid parental leave, along with sharing arrangements. Now this bill will raise the wages of all workers in the predominantly female workforce of early childhood education. If we are serious about equality, about providing opportunities for women and about a fair wage for a fair day's work, we must address the chronic underpayment of early childhood educators, and this bill provides us with the tools to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us also consider the broader societal impacts of supporting early childhood education workers. When early childhood educators are fairly compensated, we not only ensure that our children are receiving high-quality care and education but also send a clear message about what we value as a society. Are we a society that values the wellbeing and development of our youngest members? Are we a society that values fairness and gender equity? Are we a society that values qualified workers being paid fairly for their skilled work? This bill is an opportunity for us to say yes to all of those questions. It is an opportunity for us to make a meaningful investment in our future, in our children and in the people who support them in their early learning journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill is about more than just increasing wages, important as that is. It's about recognising the value of early childhood education and care workers, addressing gender pay inequity, stabilising a vital workforce and ensuring that our children have access to the high-quality care that they deserve. Early childhood education workers are some of the most important workers in the country and for our economy, and they deserve to be paid fairly. By supporting this bill we are not only doing what is right for early childhood educators but also investing in the future of our children and the future of our nation. I urge all members of this House to support this important piece of legislation. Let us stand together for wage justice, for gender equity and for the future of early childhood education in this country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I rise to support the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024, which creates grants for early childhood education and care providers to support a wage increase for their workers. I want to talk about why accessible, quality childcare is important for kids and families, why it's important that we pay childcare workers better, the structure of the bill and some concerns with it, and further reform that is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care is important for both kids and families. For kids, quality early childhood education is linked to improved academic achievement, reduced delinquency, increased school completion, higher earners in adulthood and improved social and emotional wellbeing. Children from lower socioeconomic groups experience greater and more enduring benefits from early childhood education than children from higher socioeconomic groups. For families, greater access to quality early childhood education and care increases female participation in paid work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard a range of views about the modelling done by the Productivity Commission in relation to the impact of greater access to care on female workforce participation. From personal experience, I wouldn't be surprised if this impact was understated in the PC modelling. Anecdotally, mums I know make decisions about returning to work based on the care that's available and it's cost. Having had kids in every combination of childcare options when they were small while I worked part time, I remember being asked to come into work for a meeting on a day when I was scheduled to be at home. If I was lucky enough to be able to add a casual daycare day, it cost me more than $100 per kid. I wasn't paid anything extra to come in on that day, so it cost me a lot to be flexible. Even in a well paid job, it was sometimes only marginally financially beneficial to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know how much my kids gained from the stimulation of being in centre based care and how important the workers there were to their development. Educators at my kids' childcare centres taught them things that kept surprising me as a parent. They came home with new knowledge, new ways of resolving conflict and the inevitable new viruses to build up their immune systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Childcare workers are underpaid. About 221,000 people are employed in the early childhood education and care sector. Like other professions traditionally considered women's work, we've systematically undervalued child care. The Productivity Commission has found that early childhood educators are just above the lowest paid decile when measured against other occupations. Early childhood education and care workers are paid less than people in other sectors with similar qualifications and are paid significantly less than primary and secondary school teachers, even though the years before a child turns five are a crucial time for learning. All you need to do is spend a few hours in a childcare centre, and you realise how underpaid educators are. They need to have patience, compassion, curiosity and good immune systems to do those jobs. We need to attract people to work in child care. It's such an important time for our kids' learning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud that my son, George, who's studying astrophysics at ANU, is also working part time in child care. He loves it. He loves helping kids learn how to solve problems and sharing the wonder that he finds in the world with them. Child care needs more people like George, and paying them a decent wage is a good start to attracting a vibrant and diverse workforce. I recognise that there's an inherent tension between improving access to early childhood education, and care for more people, and paying childcare workers more. Centre based day care in Australia is relatively less affordable for Australian households than in most other OECD countries. Obviously paying people more makes child care more expensive indirectly, but a pay increase recognises the inherent value of this type of work, attracts more people and contributes to the quality of care. It's worth noting that the proposed wage increases fall short of the union's calls for a 25 per cent wage increase but are a significant step up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The structure of this bill is a bit clunky. It creates a special account to fund grants to early childhood education and care providers to support a wage increase for their workers. To be eligible, providers will need to increase workers' wages by 10 per cent above the current award in the year of payment and 15 per cent above the current award in the second. Providers will need to limit fee increases a maximum of 4.4 per cent in the first year and meet other conditions. I understand it's been set up like this to ensure funding allocated goes directly to workers and not to providers' bottom lines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four issues with the bill that I want to comment on: it's inflationary impact, the lack of allocated funding, its short-term nature and the discretionary powers that it creates. Firstly, will this bill have an inflationary impact? Based on modelling, it could, effectively, be an injection of $3.6 billion over the next few years. Some providers may not take it up if they're already paying above the award, if they don't want to agree to the cap on fees, if they don't have an appropriate workplace instrument or if theirs covers more than the specific types of workers eligible for the grant. Of course, the extent to which it's taken up is correlated to its inflationary effect. I am concerned about any injection of funds that could be inflationary at this time, when inflation is having such a huge impact on cost of living.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise today to thank Opposition Leader Peter Dutton for visiting Collie and honouring his commitment to discuss in person the coalition's proposal for a small nuclear reactor to succeed the existing coal-fired Muja Power Station and underpin a balanced energy mix for Western Australia's clean energy future. Mr Dutton had a warm and productive meeting with the Shire of Collie council, answering questions raised on behalf of their community. The night prior, Nuclear for Australia hosted a Collie community information session with over 150 attendees. Nuclear experts Dr Adi Paterson, Associate Professor Tony Irwin and Lieutenant Colonel Jasmin Diab answered over 45 questions and shared their extensive experience in the commissioning and operations of nuclear facilities, addressing the safety record of nuclear and the capacity for Collie's existing workforce to pivot to high-paid jobs in the nuclear industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Concurrently, I've been conducting an online and hard-copy survey gauging community sentiment in Collie. Of the 560 responses so far, 67.5 per cent strongly support the coalition's plan to build a zero-emissions nuclear power plant at Collie using the existing site and transmission infrastructure of the Muja Power Station. Given the current 8.2 per cent unemployment rate in Collie, it was unsurprising that 73 per cent of respondents expressed concerns about job prospects post coal. Many recognise that well-paid jobs in a safe, zero-emissions nuclear power plant will provide economic security for their community over its 80- to 100-year lifespan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  In August, I had the pleasure of attending the Illawarra Live Steamers' annual luncheon. This year's event was particularly special as we celebrated their 60th anniversary, marking the significant milestone in March. The invitation to attend came from their president, my good friend Rob Robertson. The Illawarra Live Steamers is a model engineering club based in Wollongong which brings enthusiasts together to build and operate live steam powered miniature trains. With multiple tracks and monthly public running days, the club offers a fun, memorable experience for families and showcases the skill and dedication of its members. One of the Illawarra Live Steamers' youngest members, Jenson, who turned 15 at the end of August, has been successful in obtaining his probationary ticket. He still has to log some hours driving miniature trains before he is fully qualified, and I wish him the very best of luck.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Illawarra Live Steamers have shown great resilience and dedication in the countless hours spent building tracks, maintaining equipment and hosting events. Just two weeks ago, I visited and attended their open day, where I presented the committee with a signed certificate from the Prime Minister for their service to the community. Congratulations again on your 60th anniversary, and thanks to President Rob Robertson, Secretary Greg Coleman and all of the executive for providing such a great space for enthusiasts and for the general public to enjoy.</span>

We announced the program a couple of weeks ago. It will unlock 500,000 new homes in Australia through a $5 billion fund. Right now, hundreds of prime housing sites across our country are sitting idle because they don't have the basic infrastructure needed to get the homes built—the shovel-ready elements of infrastructure like water, power, sewerage, telecommunications and access roads. There's just no money at the moment to get that infrastructure built, which means no homes can be built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's $5 billion housing infrastructure program has been developed closely with councils throughout our country, large landholders and those who deliver the homes that Australians live in. We are very pleased to have the unwavering support of the Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association, who represent tens of thousands of the people who actually build the homes that Australians live in. They agree the biggest impediment to more homes being built in this country is that infrastructure. Sadly, under Labor, we see fewer homes being built. Most economists and housing specialists think they will fall 400,000 homes short of their target. Only the coalition will get the homes that Australians need to live in built.</span>

Local Copacabana Public School teacher Sandra Way is celebrating 40 years of teaching in public education in 2024—a mighty milestone which underscores Sandra's incredible dedication to our state's public education system. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sandra is a proud teacher, having started her career teaching between classes at Condell Park Public School and Tower Street Public School in 1980. In 1981, Sandra secured a full-time position at Cabramatta Public School, where she taught Australians from Vietnam with refugee backgrounds. Sandra gained significant insight into the ongoing impacts of war and hardship during these years. Shortly after, in 1983, Sandra was transferred to Gosford East Public School, where she taught a composite class of students with learning difficulties in year 1 and year 2. Sandra loved this class and learned how rewarding any small improvement was, particularly for a student trying to keep up with their peers. In 1984, Sandra was appointed to Copacabana Public School, where she has remained to the present time. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sandra has seen a lot of changes since the time she first started teaching. Whether it was the transition from chalkboards to smartboards or the transition from projectors to computers, Sandra has seen it all. Forty years of teaching is a remarkable accomplishment, and, on behalf of the people of the Central Coast, I wish to thank you, Sandra, for your service and wish you all the best in the years ahead. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Just when we thought the Tasmanian government couldn't get any worse, they've gone and completely stuffed up one of the most important infrastructure projects in Tasmania's history. With an investment of almost $1 billion, the two new Spirit of Tasmania vessels were due to be operational by now, carrying an additional 400 passengers and 40 per cent more vehicle load. But, seemingly at every turn, the project has been a circus, including construction delays, contract cancellations and an estimated cost blowout of more than $500 million. Now we've learned that the state government and the government owned entities TT-Line and TasPorts have failed to ensure the new Spirits would have somewhere to berth in the Mersey River. It's now estimated that the berths won't be ready until 2027, at an annual cost to the state economy of $350 million. In the meantime, to avoid the icy Finnish weather, the first ship must be relocated from Finland, where it's being constructed, to Scotland, which is where it will stay while the government explores options to lease or charter the vessel or until the new berth is ready. Put simply, this debacle is yet another example of the state government's complete and utter incompetence. The fact that they think they can land a third AFL stadium on time and on budget is simply laughable.</span>

Celebrating its 15th year, the Albanian Cup is a four-day celebration of Albanian culture, community and football. The event brought over 6,500 people over the four days, and 20 teams participated, from as far away as Cairns and Western Australia. They were brought to More Park Pavilion in Ardeer.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Football is a huge part of my electorate, and multiculturalism is a bedrock of football in Australia. The bulk of soccer clubs in my area were started in the mid-20th century by European migrants, who did so to celebrate their culture and bring people together. Tournaments like the Albanian Cup enable communities to celebrate and preserve their culture.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the Albanian Cup, the North Sunshine Eagles are a successful team whose senior men's team will be promoted to VPL1 in 2025. The club was also recently awarded a $75,000 grant, under the Play Our Way program, to continue their commitment to remove barriers for women and girls participating in football. This commitment extends to supporting families from a low-socioeconomic background by covering fees so that kids can continue playing the sport they love.</span>

He dreamed of Australia as a place where he took the degraded wasteland and turned it into a lacework of thin green, where the rivers flowed to irrigate the outback, and where inland towns have work and industry—wealth and prosperity. Now we've got a chance to make that dream a reality with the Bridle Track Tunnel between Mareeba and Cairns. This isn't just fancy infrastructure; it opens the gateway to four of Australia's six biggest rivers, none of which have waters that are being used.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a lifeline for North Queensland. Brisbane has 36 kilometres of tunnels and one million people. North Queensland has one million people but no tunnels. The greater Cairns region recorded the highest death rate on roads per head of population in Australia in the last two months. One tunnel would have overcome those deaths. When the tunnel is built, it will open up access to the giant Chillagoe Mineral Province— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

The $46,000 grant will go towards establishing a women's team that are able to service Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula, as there were no other premier options locally for those on the southern end of the peninsula. I love the club's vision to remove barriers and engage more women in cricket, and the Albanese Labor government is supporting local sporting clubs to do just this with programs like Play Our Way.</span>

Thank you, Mike, Julie, Hayden and others on the committee for all you do for our community and for creating opportunities for women to pursue their cricket aspirations. I am very much looking forward to visiting for another hit soon, but only underarm bowling is allowed!</span>

Of the backup generators that were in place, one was being serviced and the other one shortly after failed, which caused a huge amount of hardship not only to the people of Broken Hill but also the other communities in the far west. That also affected the telecommunications towers. There's been a massive job to get everything back in order, from Telstra putting generators into those towers to Essential Energy and Transgrid getting generators up and going. It has caused hardship. There's a of wastage. Most people in town, including the coffee shops, lost all the contents of their fridges and freezers. Indeed, someone stole the generator from the pharmacy, so the chilled pharmaceuticals were all ruined. It was a major disaster.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge Senator McAllister, who has shown great interest and has been in communication with me about the federal response to this. Just as a comment, though, Broken Hill is surrounded by renewables, including solar and wind, and there's a high level of rooftop solar. But, on this particular occasion, that seemed to work against getting the power back on track, with the surging solar impacting the generators.</span>

The University of Canberra Capitals is one of the first Australian teams, with a longstanding commitment to inclusiveness and equality, and Mrs Lodding has been involved in the sport of basketball locally for over 50 years, as both a player and an administrator. She's been manager of the University of Canberra Capitals since 1993.</span>

This follows a $15 million upgrade to the arena, achieved in partnership with the ACT Labor government. The upgrade effectively doubles crowd capacity, not only allowing more fans to witness the excitement of live basketball but also allowing for the growth being witnessed across women's sport. Congratulations to the Capitals on 40 amazing years and to Mrs Lodding for her outstanding service to the Capitals and to basketball locally.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I'd like to pay tribute to Crescent Head legend and sporting identity Geoff Kennett, who passed away just last month. He was a member of a very special group of people—just one of 20 runners to compete in 50 consecutive City2Surf races. Geoff was educated at Trinity Grammar and excelled in sport, and he caught the eye of New South Wales selectors while playing first-grade cricket as a talented left arm quick. But, lured by the waves, Geoff set cricket aside as he fell in love with surfing, joining his mates to represent North Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club. It was with these mates that he ran his first City2Surf. Another of Geoff's accomplishments was competing in the world championships in Spain as captain of the Australian water skiing team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Geoff moved to his beloved Crescent Head in the early eighties and involved himself with community sport, generously sharing his time, knowledge and passion for training with many of the local athletes. Over the years, Geoff competed in numerous events, from fun runs to marathons, short-course triathlons and ironman races. Those who knew him referred to him as Superman. Geoff's footsteps will be missed on the road to Bondi and the beaches of Crescent Head and by his loving wife, Bobbie, son, Matt, family and many, many friends. Vale, Geoff Kennett.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Last Thursday, I welcomed Assistant Minister for Immigration Matt Thistlethwaite to Holt for a meeting with leaders from our Tamil and Afghan communities. Holt is home to one of Australia's largest refugee populations, many of whom have enjoyed long years of uncertainty under the Liberals' failed policies. Some have been here for over 15 years now with Australian families yet remain on short-term visas, consistently fearing deportation. Our government has taken significant steps to address these issues. Since coming to office, we've granted 19,000 refugees permanent residencies and abolished the flawed fast-track system, creating a stable future for those seeking refuge. It is disappointing that Peter Dutton wants to take us backwards and cut our humanitarian program to only 13,750 places per year, keeping more families separated. As a migrant, I am proud to be part of a government that takes our voices seriously. This meeting with Minister Thistlethwaite allowed community leaders to voice their feedback on remaining gaps in the system. Their input is essential in shaping policies that uphold Australia's values of fairness and compassion.</span>

The popular facility has become a central hub for our community, and, over the past 25 years, there has been a steady growth in membership to 22,500 members, who regularly use the clubhouse for sporting and community use. The resident clubs are the Joondalup Bowling Club, the Joondalup City Football Club and the Joondalup Districts Cricket Club, formerly known as the North Perth Cricket Club, with a rich history dating back to 1898. Committee members Craig Gerrans and Brett Raponi recently visited my office to seek assistance with much-needed capital improvements. The cricket club has been successful in securing funding for the lighting of the practice nets; however, an electrical transformer upgrade is required at the cost of $200,000. Due to increasing female participation in sports such as cricket and soccer, a refurbishment of the change rooms and toilet facilities is essential. Finally, a refrigerated air-conditioning upgrade to the well-patronised clubhouse is warranted. On behalf of the Beaumaris Sports Association, I make the strong case in support of contributions from all three levels of government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  The electorate of Spence is a hub of innovation. Each and every day in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, some of the most impressive technology work in the country happens in our backyard. Perhaps more importantly, that work in our community serves as an unlocked door of opportunity for people in the north, giving our future innovators a chance to gain valuable skills in advanced manufacturing and beyond and to make their mark in the present. BAE Systems Australia at the Edinburgh Parks facility is a prime example of a manufacturer doing exactly that. I was fortunate enough to pay them a visit alongside the Special Envoy for Defence, Veterans' Affairs and Northern Australia, the member for Solomon, last week. We were honoured to meet advanced manufacturing apprentices on the ground, like Hayley, Damon and Dhanush. Hayley spoke of the warm family-like environment that's being fostered for young apprentices like herself at BAE. Damon loves the ability to apply mathematical skills to deliver innovative engineering solutions. Dhanush appreciated the fact that everything is a learning opportunity, with apprentices encouraged to be the best versions of themselves. The experiences of these fine young apprentices are just the tip of the iceberg at BAE, where members of our community are making an invaluable contribution to our national security through their own rewarding innovation in a welcoming environment. I say to all of you: keep up the great work down there at Edinburgh Parks.</span>

He promised that life would be cheaper under him: there would be cheaper power bills, cheaper mortgages and much else. But, 2½ years later, the reality is very different from his promise. Power bills were supposed to go down, but they've gone up and up—in some cases, by $1,000 per household. Mortgage rates were supposed to go down. In fact, they have gone up and up and up. The cash rate is up by 12 times under this government, and a typical household with a mortgage is now paying up to $30,000 extra a year. We are seeing prices going up, across the board. Education is up 11.2 per cent, since the election. Food is up 12.3 per cent, housing is up 13.1 per cent and gas is up 33.8 per cent. Core inflation, in the year to the September quarter, is at 3.5 per cent, well above the Reserve Bank's target range, and homegrown inflation is running at seven times imported inflation. </span>

It's time to stop the excuses, Prime Minister and Treasurer, and get the cost of living down, like you promised. </span>

After their drumming in Queensland and the ACT, and in council elections across New South Wales and Victoria, the Greens, in a rare moment of clarity, have admitted that they need to do some soul-searching. Their extremism, militancy and sheer bloody-mindedness has cost them votes. But the cost to Australians wanting to rent or buy is even higher. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best time to pass Labor's housing bills, particularly our shared equity scheme, would have been 339 days ago, but the next best time is now. This scheme replaces the bank of mum and dad with the government, who stumps up 30 to 40 per cent of the price of a home, enabling Aussies on modest incomes to get a foot in the housing market. At 40,000 spots, it's not going to fix the housing crisis—and we never claimed it would—because there is no silver bullet. We know that. This is why we need multifaceted solutions like our build to rent reforms, which will deliver 160,000 homes in the next 10 years. But, again, this has been held up by the Greens and the Libs. </span>

There is hope for the Greens. They could take a swig from the cup of pragmatism and actually pass our bills, and I urge them to do so this week. </span>

The other $10,000 is in a range of things that have increased under this government. Remember the $275 cut to your power bill?

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  Accessible, affordable health care is one of the things I and most Australians value. It underpins our quality of life. It's part of the Australian way of life. Prior to the introduction of Medicare 40 years ago, medical bills were the No. 1 cause of bankruptcy in this country, as they still are in many places around the world. Now it's unheard of here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this government tripled the bulk-billing incentive, we've seen 5.5 million additional bulk-billed visits in the past 12 months, addressing the slide in bulk-billing rates we inherited from those opposite. We know that over a million Australians were going without their medication prior to the minister introducing cheaper medicines, cutting the co-payment, freezing PBS prices and introducing 60-day prescriptions—two months medication for the price of one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've open 75 bulk-billing urgent care clinics across the country, and soon they will have seen a million patients. The Marion urgent care clinic in Boothby opened almost exactly a year ago today and has seen over 11,000 patients through its doors. It is fully bulk-billed. That's 11,000 fewer people in emergency departments or waiting for care. This government is committed to protecting Medicare from the Leader of the Opposition, who was voted by doctors as the worst-ever health minister, and the shadow Treasurer, who has threatened to cut, cut, cut.</span>

What we have done in government is halve inflation. When we came to government, it had a six in front of it, and today it has a two in front of it. We've done that while we've created on our watch one million jobs—the first time that has ever happened by any government in any term since Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we've got real wages increasing. They've increased by more since we came to government than what occurred under their previous nine long years. What we have also done is provide cost-of-living relief when it's been necessary and done it in a way that is responsible. But they've never seen any cost-of-living relief they didn't want to bag. They've never supported any of it, so it's not surprising they're not supporting this relief either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this is about is cutting student debt by 20 per cent. The first thing we'll do if we're re-elected is introduce legislation. Three million people will benefit. A typical university graduate will see their debt cut by $5½ thousand. As a direct result of what the former government, the Morrison government, did—by lowering the threshold in which payments have to come back—for some people their interest that they are paying is more than their original debt. That is a direct result. So we're also raising the student debt repayment threshold from $54,000 to $67,000 and lowering the repayment rate. If you're earning $70,000 a year, you'll save $1,300 a year in repayments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in addition to that, we are also making free TAFE permanent. Already, 500,000 Australians have benefitted. There are more tradies to build homes, more apprentices getting a start, more carers to look after our loved ones and more opportunities for Australians. We understand that education is the key to opening those doors of opportunity and we want to widen them. That's what this government is about, and I'm proud of the announcements that we made over the last few days. And, over the coming days and weeks and months, there will be more about what our second-term agenda looks like. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that, if we win the next election, the first legislation that we introduce to parliament will cut all student debts by 20 per cent. That will help three million Australians right across the country, including 27,000 people in the electorate of Macnamara.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're people with a uni degree. They're also people with a TAFE qualification. If they have got the average student debt of, say, 27 grand, that will wipe $5,500 off their bill. If they have a debt of 50 grand, it will wipe about $10,000 off their bill. That's a lot of help for a lot of young Australians just out of uni, just out of TAFE, maybe just moving out of home and just getting started. If we win the next election, we will also make it easier for them to pay off those debts. You won't have to start paying it off until you earn $67,000. In other words, you won't have to start paying it off until going to uni or going to TAFE starts to pay off for you. We'll also reduce the minimum payments that you have to make each year. So, if you are earning about $75,000, we'll reduce the repayments that you have to make next year by about $1,000. That's an extra thousand dollars in your pocket rather than the government's. That's real cost-of-living relief—cutting their debts and reducing their repayments. It's all part of building a better and fairer education system. It's all part of building Australia's future.</span>

                  </a>  The Liberal Party. That's what they said on the weekend. At least three million Australians now know where they stand. That's everyone from chippies and sparkies with a TAFE qualification to teachers and nurses with a uni degree. They now know that, if Labor win the next election, we will cut their debts by 20 per cent and, if the Liberals win, they won't. They know Labor will help them and the Liberals will dud them. That's what they'll be doing—dudding three million Australians, making them pay thousands more in debt and making it harder to pay off, harder to get started and harder to get ahead. That's what's happened. That's what we've got now with the modern Liberal Party on any education or any aspiration. This Prime Minister wants to open the doors of opportunity wider. This opposition leader wants to slam them shut.</span>

But what was going to happen under their plan was that we were all going to get a tax cut but low- and middle-income earners were going to miss out, and they're still justifying their old scheme. We look forward to and we wait for their policy to claw back the tax cuts that they've called 'waste'.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take the interjection from the Leader of the National Party, who said; 'How much did it cost you—the 60-day dispensing?' What he doesn't say, and what he should interject, is: How much did people benefit? How much do pensioners benefit when they go to the pharmacy and get cheaper medicines? That's what we provided. On the one hand, they ask a question about households, and, at the same time, they interject about every single measure that we have put in place. Whether it's cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, energy price relief or tax cuts for all, all of these measures make a difference. Fee-free TAFE is making a difference. The measures that we announced yesterday they've already said they'll oppose. There's not a single cost-of-living measure that those opposite are prepared to support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:17</span>):  Thanks to the member for Moreton for his question. We're going to miss you, mate, when you retire at the first half of next year, but young Leo and young Stan will get a bit more time with the old man, and that's a good thing as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Moreton understands, as we do, that, even with inflation coming off considerably and the progress that we've made in the economy, people are still under pressure. We also know that that pressure is often felt disproportionately by young people, including people who are carrying a lot of student debt. This is part of the intergenerational unfairness in our economy, which we are determined to address in a responsible way. It's why we made the tax cuts fairer for young people. It's why we increased rent assistance twice and are building more homes. It's why we're already legislating to make the indexation of student debt fairer. And it's why I want to pay tribute to this Prime Minister, this education minister and this skills minister for the three important announcements that they made on the weekend: firstly, to make fee-free TAFE a permanent feature of our system; secondly, to lift the amount of money people can earn before they start paying student debt back; and, thirdly, to slash that debt by 20 per cent. This is all about easing cost-of-living pressures and lifting some of the burden on young people. It means more Australians keeping more of what they earn and paying back less debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not everybody in this House thinks we should help students and graduates with the cost of living. Those opposite want Australians to have more student debt, not less. They couldn't care less about the pressures that young people are facing in our country. These are the same characters who say they oppose these changes on economic and fiscal grounds and the same people who left us with much higher inflation and much more debt in the budget. When they were in office, inflation had a 6 in front of it, and now it has a 2 in front of it. It was much higher and rising under them, and now it's lower and falling under us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've more than halved inflation in our time in office, and debt is $150 billion lower under us because our responsible economic management has been cleaning up the mess that those opposite left behind. Our responsible economic management has meant that we can get the budget in better nick and make room for what really matters, for the things that our society really treasurers and values. Easing the cost of living and lifting some of the debt burden on young people is a really important part of that effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite would throw it all away and they would make life harder for young people and for Australians more broadly. That is one of the many real risks and one of the many real costs of the reckless arrogance of this opposition leader. This side of the House wants to make life easier for young people; that side of the House wants to make it harder. That has been made very clear in the last 24 hours.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:21</span>):  My question as to the Prime Minister. In an interview on ABC Perth on 24 September you defended your government's refusal to implement a complete ban on the advertising of sports and online gambling, by saying the problem is overwhelmingly poker machines. Why don't you use the Corporations Act or the Commonwealth's tax powers to implement harm-minimisation measures nationally on poker machines? Or is the reality that the Labor Party is simply in the pockets of the predatory gambling companies?</span>

                  </a>  On a point of order—the last part of that question offends the standing orders in a number of ways, including, obviously, being an imputation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>
                  </a>  The standing orders are pretty clear. I am going to rule that last part of the question out. Standing order 100(d)(iv) is clear that questions must not contain imputations. I take this opportunity to remind all members that this is a warning: other speakers in similar circumstances have ruled out the entire question when this starts creeping into the questions. It's a warning for every member that I will not tolerate imputations. At this instance, I am not prepared to rule the question out of order, but I will rule the last part out. If it continues and this trend emerges, just so everyone is clear, the question will just be ruled out and we'll move to the next question. I give the call to the Prime Minister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:23</span>):  I thank the member for Boothby for her question and I thank her and the other South Australian members for hosting us in the great city of Adelaide yesterday, along with Peter Malinauskas, the premier South Australia. This government does want to help more Australians in both TAFE and university in higher education, but we want do to more than that as well. We want the continuing of education from early childhood education—and the measures we have made there include the 15 per cent pay increase, with 10 per cent this December and another five per cent next December—to the work the minister for education is doing in schools, where we have $16 billion on the table to support the objectives that have been around since the Gonski review, which would lift the resourcing standard up for every student. I note that a range of states and territories have already signed up, and we're hoping to get more in coming weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when it comes to higher ed, it is absolutely vital that we invest because 80 per cent of the students who are currently in primary school will require either a university degree or a TAFE qualification in order to get employment in their post-school years. It's not something that's an add-on; it's something that will be a necessary component.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why yesterday we announced that three million people will benefit from the 20 per cent cut in student debt. A typical university graduate will see their debt cut by $5,500. That's why we're raising the student debt repayment threshold so that if you're earning $70,000 a year, you'll save $1,300 a year in repayments. That's why we're making free TAFE permanent. Just before question time I met with some apprentice mechanics who are working at Toyota here in Canberra. They're up there in the gallery—the fantastic apprentices who are taking the opportunity to better their lives but also to make a contribution to our national economy. That will make an enormous difference. It will help everyone with student debt now and deliver a better deal for students in the year ahead. Permanent structural reform to boost take-home pay for young Australians, putting more money back into pockets. It's good for cost of living, good for intergenerational equity and good for building Australia's future.</span>

                  </a>  I'm very specifically referring to the exact dataset the shadow Treasurer is asking me about. I've pointed out to him that GDP per capita went backwards for consecutive quarters under those opposite. We have acknowledged, in a number of different ways—from this dispatch box and outside this parliament—that growth in the Australian economy has been very soft and households are doing it tough. People are doing a tough.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I made at the start of my answer and that I want to reiterate here is that if you care about per capita living standards in this economy, you have two options. One option is to try and help people where you can; that's our approach. The other option is to oppose wage increases and cost-of-living help, which is the approach of those opposite.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the GDP measure of growth in our economy has been weak under governments of both political persuasions; we acknowledge that. The difference is we are doing something about it. This goes right to the core of the question. On the weekend, when we said that we were going to help students and graduates with student debt, those opposite said they opposed it. The reason they said they opposed it was because it didn't apply to everyone.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, it is directly relevant because it goes to living standards and to helping people who are doing it tough. The point I am making is this: when we tried to give a tax cut to every taxpayer, they said it was too broad. Now that we are helping with student debt, they say it is too narrow. Make up your mind. They need to decide: do they care about per capita living standards or not? If they do, they should support our efforts to help people with the cost of living. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The member for Higgins, like many of the members of the side of the House, has had consultations with young people, has gone out there and spoken to young people in her electorate, and I'm grateful for her bringing the question here to the parliament. Last year we held national consultations with around 5,000 young people right across Australia to talk to them about the issues that matter most to them. They told us that cost of living was their No. 1 issue. The No. 1 issue was cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education and training were among the top five issues that young people most cared about. We heard from young Australians that they were acutely feeling cost-of-living pressures and they were struggling, particularly with the cost of higher and further education. In fact, if I may, one respondent to our national youth survey said: 'I would love to study more and I would love to upskill; however, university is so expensive that I do not feel it is an option for me.' That was a young person saying they don't feel that higher education is an option for them. At a youth roundtable that I held with the member for Perth in Perth recently, participants who were school students told us they were worried about taking on the debt associated with going to university. And another survey respondent said to us, 'Making education cheaper, whether it is university, school or TAFE, would lead to greater success among young people.' That is what we are hearing from young people directly and they are the words of young people telling us what matters to them—the cost of living and the cost of education. That is why this government is taking action. That is why we are announced we would slash student debt by 20 per cent for everyone. That means, for the average university student, around a $5,500 cut from their HECS debt. That is significant for young people who are struggling with the cost of living. We are raising the threshold from which students have to start repaying their debt, meaning people can pay off their debt more easily.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all young people need to go to university, not all young people want to go to university and not all young people should go to university. TAFE and vocational education are really important components of higher education and we want to make sure young people can access TAFE. That's why we have a $1.5 billion investment in fee-free TAFE and VET places, already supporting 500,000 student enrolments since January last year. That's why we're bringing down the cost for young Australians. We're opening doors for them to pursue education and to build a better future for themselves and for Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we saw last week was the inflation rate with a two in front of it and the monthly rate going down to 2.1. I remember the March 2022 quarter where the quarterly figure was 2.1. So, in the last quarter in which those opposite were in office, it was 2.1, the same as an annual figure that was released last week. The four figures last week all came down—every indicator of inflation—and that is because of a range of measures, including the delivery of two budget surpluses, something that would be unrecognisable to those opposite. And bear this in mind. They promised before the 2013 election that they would deliver a surplus the first year and every year thereafter. One of the reasons why inflation was such a problem in Australia, as the COVID inquiry report confirmed, was the wasteful expenditure—giving $20 billion to companies that weren't seeing a decrease in their revenue, some of which were seeing an increase in their revenue. Now, the cash rate under the Leader of the Opposition as Assistant Treasurer was 6.75 per cent.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Skills and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I thank my friend the member for Aston for her question. She knows that the Albanese government has put public TAFE back at the centre of training. Under our government, more than half a million people have taken up the opportunity of a fee-free TAFE place. We've opened the door for Australians to get the skills they want and which our economy needs to build Australia's future, and Australians are seizing that opportunity. There have been 35,000 enrolments in construction courses, and the same number in early education. There have been 50,000 enrolments in digital technology and 130,000 in aged and disability care. There is no doubt that free TAFE is changing lives, and that is why we are locking it in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister announced in Adelaide yesterday, the Albanese Labor government will introduce legislation to establish fee-free TAFE as an enduring feature of our national vocational education and training system. This will be funding 100,000 free TAFE places a year every year from 2027. This will give certainty to students, industry, TAFEs and the community. It will help give jobseekers a fresh start. It will support more young people training for a new career and assist more older workers who are skilling up for a new opportunity. After a decade of neglect from those opposite, the Albanese government is committed to rebuilding the vocational education and training sector. Free TAFE is supporting a prosperous and equitable Australia, removing financial barriers to education and training, and delivering a coordinated response to workforce shortages. It gives Australians the confidence to study.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Grayson in Frankston. He's a fee-free TAFE student studying for a Certificate IV in Mental Health. This is what he told me: 'I struggled a lot in high school, and I never thought I'd study again. I was never going back to studying.' But what helped him make his decision was that the pressure of money had been removed. Not having to think about that meant that he was confident to go on to further education, and now he says he really, really loved his time in the course. I also met Cristy in Loganlea, who is studying towards a diploma of nursing. She said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It felt like the right time to take the next step in my career, and Fee-Free TAFE is a huge help. The financial support has allowed me to focus on my studies without worrying about tuition costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Nursing careers will always be in demand, and no artificial intelligence can replace the compassion and empathy nurses provide.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She urges others to take up these opportunities and she says: 'Being free is a massive bonus.' I agree with Cristy, and, as long as there is a Labor government, free TAFE is here to stay.</span>

Given that the Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said that divestiture-like powers would be 'useful to have in the toolkit', why won't the Prime Minister stand up for families and farmers against the big supermarkets and back the coalition's supermarket proposals introduced to parliament today, including tough, new court-ordered divestiture powers?</span>

That's our objective as a Labor government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not that long ago, in the last couple of weeks or so, I stood next to the terrific chair of the ACCC who was asked about divestiture powers. The point that the chair made then and the point that I want to make now is that the things that we are doing to crack down on the supermarkets will make the sorts of powers that the Leader of the National Party is talking about today unnecessary. If we get in at the start and prevent the kinds of mergers which are anticompetitive, and if we get in and do the right thing in the terms of the legislation that Assistant Minister Leigh, Minister Jones and I have been working on, then we can get the right kind of outcome without going towards these sorts of proposals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we should be very wary about the proposals that the Leader of the Nationals has put forward today is that we want to make sure that there aren't unintended consequences when it comes to divestiture. Divestiture powers are a blunt instrument. They are rarely used in any other jurisdiction, and, frankly, we've got better ways to crack down on anticompetitive behaviour, especially when it comes to supermarkets. We don't see any evidence anywhere in the world that breaking up the major supermarkets is working. If you force supermarket one to divest and the only viable buyer is another big supermarket chain, then that divestiture makes things worse. It makes things less competitive, not more competitive.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish on this point. The merger that risks consumers the most in this country right now is this very bizarre merger between the Greens political party and the Liberal and National parties. This is the merger which should trouble Australian consumers the most. This is the merger that risks doing the most damage to people who are struggling to make ends meet—</span>

The difference between this side of the House and that side of the House—and, frankly, up there as well—is they just get to write these kinds of neatly worded press releases. We've actually got to run the place. We're making our economy more competitive in a range of ways, and we're working very closely with the wonderful ACCC Chair as we do it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the core of all these issues is actually something quite straightforward: Australia has not been building enough housing in this country for more than a generation. That's why our government is working with the states to build more homes, because the more homes we build, the more affordable housing will be for all Australians.</span>

Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that a Labor government would continue its transformative support of TAFE, with a commitment to deliver 100,000 fee-free TAFE places every year. This is absolutely massive. It will permanently remove this cost barrier to training for 100,000 people in our country every year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Labor government, we know that when we offer Australians opportunities like this, they grab them with both hands. Since we introduced fee-free TAFE in 2023, more than half a million people have taken up this opportunity of free training, with 35,000 of those in occupations which are critical to construction and housing. We stumped up another $86 billion to work with states and territories to fund another 20,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places in courses critical to construction and housing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We arrived in office to find our country in the grips of the worst labour shortage that we've experienced in our country since the Second World War. Part of that problem was the decade of neglect and cuts that we saw to education, to training and to apprentices. If that has a familiar ring to it, it's because this is what we can expect from the Liberals if they get into office, what they're offering on housing.</span>

As a direct result—take for example our Help to Buy legislation. Our Help to Buy legislation was something that we took to the last election. Just like what they did with the HAFF, they actually have motions moved in the Senate between the Greens and the coalition where they defer things off into the never-never and say we can't talk about it, in this case, until the November sittings.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>We have in the November sittings as well aged-care reform. We have environmental reform there to create a national EPA for the first time. But the Greens and the coalition are holding that up in the Senate. We already have, of course, legislation that would reduce the debt for three million Australians by changing the indexation rules on HECS. I'm not sure whether the Greens political party have committed to amend that or support that. I'm not sure, because, even when things are their policy, they say that they're not voting for it. They say they're not voting for it unless you change tax policy or you change this or that. The fact is that what we are doing—and we will do this across a range of areas; it began yesterday—is a range of legislation that we have committed to for this term. We want to see it carried either this year or when parliament sits next year. And then there is legislation committing to a second-term agenda for what we will do as well. So we make no apologies, this period out from an election, for saying what a re-elected Labor government will do. A re-elected Labor government will continue to prioritise and build on what we have done already. We've already done 500,000 fee-free TAFE places. We'll make it permanent. We've already reduced the debt for Australian graduates, whether it be apprentices or university graduates. We'll do more as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="264121" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:53</span>):  I thank the member for Spence for his question and for his personal commitment to making sure that every opportunity is available to young people in his electorate. For the last 2½ years, the Albanese government has been on a mission to lift the quality of aged care in Australia—to make a career in aged care something that you aspire to to create a better life for yourself and to make sure that, whether you are a kitchen hand in Perth, a personal care worker in Dalby or a registered nurse in Randwick, you feel valued and respected and that the doors of opportunity are open for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have ensured that workers get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, investing $15.1 billion to deliver a pay rise in aged care. Underneath the Albanese Labor government, registered nurses are now taking home an additional $196 per week, or more than $10,000 a year, extra. Personal care workers are now taking home an additional $141 per week, or $7,300 a year, extra. And then we delivered a tax cut so that workers aren't just earning more but keeping more of what they earn. A registered nurse on a level 1.3 award wage is receiving a tax cut of $1,745. A personal care worker with a certificate III qualification is receiving a tax cut of $1,166.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our work to support and strengthen the aged-care workforce has not stopped there. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that, if re-elected, the Albanese government will wipe 20 per cent of student debt for everyone and make minimum repayments fairer. A registered nurse with a $20,000 HECS debt will see $4,000 wiped off their bill. A personal care worker earning $60,000 will have to pay back $600 a year less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To make sure we're not just growing the workforce but growing a skilled workforce, we will continue to fund fee-free TAFE. So far 130,000 students have taken up this opportunity in aged care and in disability care. I travelled to Far North Queensland and met with a personal care worker named Clyde who had a cert III. He told me that he was only able to do his cert III because of Labor's pay rise. He told me that he wants to go on now and do a Certificate IV and then eventually get his bachelor's, all while continuing his career in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have good news for Clyde. Under a re-elected Albanese government, fee-free TAFE will be here to stay. That's what we've been working towards, and that's who we have been working for. We've been working for people like Clyde who have aspirations to create a better life for themselves and for their families. Those opposite might think that these jobs don't matter, but I can tell you that care economy jobs are real jobs. They're looking after older Australians. What job could be more real than that? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He might want to check that. No doubt he can fix the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> later. He's only a decade out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is, unfortunately, dishonest of the shadow Treasurer to ask a question about inflation without acknowledging the very welcome and very encouraging data we got just last Wednesday. That showed that the inflation that we inherited at 6.1 per cent is now at 2.8 per cent. He could have mentioned that. He could have mentioned, as well, that, if he wants to ask me a question about headline inflation, he shouldn't have spent the last six months saying that headline inflation doesn't matter and that only underlying inflation matters. He's got to make up his mind about which one of those he wants to use. And, if he's going to ask me about inflation, he should fess up to their shameful record on inflation, when inflation was more than twice what it is now on our watch. Inflation was much higher and rising under them, and it's much lower and falling under us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He asked me about the IMF report, and I'm obviously not going to read to him the IMF report. I assume he has someone who turns the IMF reports into little cartoons so that he can understand them. But I will say this about the IMF report: the IMF has valuable insights to make. The IMF has valuable insights to share with the global economic community. We have our own forecasts, which we'll update in the usual way in the mid-year update. The Reserve Bank have their own forecasts, which they'll update this week, as it turns out. I know that those forecasts, like the ones that he asked me about, are always the subject, rightly, of a lot of focus and a lot of attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll say this, and it's a bit like what the Prime Minister said a moment ago: if you want to make comparisons between countries, make the full comparisons. Inflation peaked lower and later here than in most other countries. Rates started rising here later than in most other countries. They rose by less and had a lower peak here than in most other countries, when it comes to interest rates—and inflation similarly. And, if you want to compare us to other countries, acknowledge that a lot of countries have got higher unemployment than us as well. A lot of other countries have got weaker economies than we do. Two-thirds of the OECD had at least one negative quarter in the last year. So I say to the shadow Treasurer that, if he wants to make comparisons, he should make the whole comparison.</span>

For workers in the electorate of Hunter and around Australia, they started in effect on Friday, so those laws that those on this side supported and those opposite opposed are finding their way into people's pay packets. The question asks about the results and the response. The results are now in people's pay packets, and the response from those opposite is that this is all at risk at the election. This is one of the areas they have targeted and the opposition leader has announced they would get rid of. He might not like costed policies, but he really likes policies that cost—policies that cost workers and policies that cost households.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Batchfire mine, in Queensland, 320 labour hire workers will receive pay rises of up to $20,000 a year. Every dollar is at risk under those opposite. In relation to Australian Country Choice production meatworks, the meatworkers' unions estimated that 200 labour hire workers there are now getting a pay rise of up to $500 a week. We stood up to Qantas when Qantas were arguing that labour hire workers should be underpaid. In fact, what did the Leader of the Opposition say? I will quote the Leader of the Opposition. His words were 'full credit to Alan Joyce'—full credit to Alan Joyce for labour hire workers to be paid less. Yet 2,450 cabin crew at Qantas are being converted to direct employment, seeing pay rises of $300 a week; 800 labour hire flight attendants, pay rises up 28 per cent. The coalition called same job, same pay a made-up issue. Senator Hume said workers getting these wage increases would be 'the worst thing'. We now need to find out from the Leader of the Opposition: Is his plan on repealing these to directly cut their pay? To freeze their pay? To allow labour hire back in so that they are simply made redundant and have to come back and apply for their own jobs? No matter which way you cut it, the policies of those opposite are taking to the election put these pay rises at direct threat and are saying to these workers that those opposite believe that they are being paid too much and they want to cut their pay.</span>

The Headstone Project undertakes valuable work identifying unmarked graves of World War I veterans and provides them with a modest headstone. A request for deductible gift recipient status by Headstone Project South Australia was denied last December despite its Tasmanian counterpart receiving GDR status in 2020.

We do our best, working closely with Assistant Minister Leigh, to work out how we impose some sort of order and some sort of priority on those. But if there's been some kind of obvious issue here with this one then I am obviously happy to take another look.</span>

You wouldn't know it from those opposite but, since parliament last sat, we got quarterly and monthly inflation numbers for September. Inflation at 2.8 per cent was the lowest in almost four years. Inflation is now in the Reserve Bank's target range for the first time since 2021, underlying inflation came down substantially as well and is now the lowest it's been in almost three years, and monthly inflation came down to 2.1 per cent. So headline, underlying and monthly inflation all came down quite a bit and that means we are making welcome, encouraging, heartening progress in the fight against inflation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that people are still doing it tough and we know that the fight isn't over yet. But when we came to office, inflation was much higher and rising; now it is much lower and falling. When we came to office, it had a six in front of it and now it has a two in front of it under us. Inflation is back in the target band and our policies are helping. We are coming at this cost-of-living challenge from every conceivable and responsible angle. The announcements that the PM and the education and skills ministers made on the weekend go to those cost-of-living efforts that we are making as a government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy rebates are also making a welcome difference but they don't tell the whole story. Our two surpluses are helping as well. This is something that the Reserve Bank governor has, herself, acknowledged: when it comes to the fight against inflation, our responsible economic management—whether it's the two surpluses or the way we are designing our cost-of-living help—is helping in the fight against inflation and we are making good progress. The inflation numbers last week were welcome, and they were encouraging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, those opposite pore over them, looking for any anti-government angle, because they desperately want inflation to be higher. They desperately want inflation and interest rates to be higher, because it suits their political purposes. If you step back for a moment from the politics and the partisanship and consider what Australia has achieved under this Prime Minister, inflation has more than halved, real wages are growing again, a million jobs created in a single parliamentary term for the first time ever, tax cuts for every taxpayer, two surpluses, $150 billion less debt and saving $80 billion in debt interest. That's what responsible economic management looks like, and this is the progress which is at risk under the reckless arrogance of the opposition leader and the callous cluelessness of his hopeless shadow Treasurer. We are managing the economy in the interests of the Australian people, supporting them in tough times and getting inflation down. All of these outcomes are unrecognisable to those opposite.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  I have a short statement to make for the information of members. One of our long-serving senior parliamentary officers, Mr Russell Chafer, will be retiring at the end of next week. Many of you would know Russell, who was at the table today as deputy clerk for question time. Russell joined the Department of the House of Representatives in September 1993 and has spent 31 years here working in the committee office as well as in the international and parliamentary relations and clerks' offices, and, as deputy sergeant-at-arms since 2021, Russell has also held the most senior position of the House committee office as Clerk Assistant (Committees). For many years now, Russell has also undertaken the critical role of a clerk at the table in the House and the Federation Chamber, providing procedural advice and support to the Speaker and all members. As this is Russell's last sitting week before he embarks on his retirement, I know members will join me in acknowledging his 31 years of dedicated support, guidance and advice to the House, its committees and members. All the best, Russell.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  I am concerned about any injection of funds that could be inflationary at this time, when inflation is having a huge impact on cost of living, but childcare workers are some of the lowest paid workers in the country. In a budget of more than $600 billion, it seems reasonable that we should be able to find a few billion to pay women well and value our children's early education. I am concerned that there's no allocation of funds for this special account, despite the estimated cost of the grant program being $3.6 billion for the next few years. We'll have to wait for the annual appropriations bill to see how much money is put into this account, but the giving of grants is not dependent on funds being put into this account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's possible that the payments have been set up through this special account as a way of making it harder for an alternative government to take the pay rise away from childcare workers if the government doesn't win next year's election. But setting this up without allocating funds does feel like kicking the can down the road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My last concern is in relation to the short-term timeframe. The bill is hazy about what happens after the first two years. The worker retention payment is considered an interim payment while the Fair Work Commission finalises its gender undervaluation review of priority awards and the government considers the recent ACCC and Productivity Commission reports on early childhood education and care. If the government wants to see long-term structural reform to pay feminised industries better wages and drive a long-term improvement in the quality of care, the government will need to come clean about how it would fund this in the long term. If this increase is not going to be paid through higher fees in the long term, we need to have an open discussion about the social and economic benefit of high-quality early childhood education and care. Without the support of the coalition, this may go the way of the similar Early Years Quality Fund, which was ended with Tony Abbott not supporting that program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another concern is the broad discretionary powers created. The government can make grants and there isn't much guidance on the use of these powers in the legislation. I am hoping that these and other issues are addressed in the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's report, which I believe came out today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the changes made in this bill, further reform is needed. There is some momentum towards creating universal access to quality early childhood education and care. This is obviously a big change and would require a pathway to get there, but it's the sort of bold thinking that has the potential to set us on a pathway to a better educated and are more fully productive population. I recognise that this would require nearly 50,000 early childhood education and care graduates a year by 2030, more than double recent graduating numbers. This will take time, but it seems to me to be the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other reform needed is in relation to the activity test. The activity test is based on an assumption that early childhood education and care is a benefit for parents, not for kids. Recognising the benefits for kids, especially from lower socioeconomic families, leads to the conclusion that reforming the activity test would have long-term benefits. I would like to see the activity test removed, relaxed or substantially reconfigured in line with recommendations from the Productivity Commission, the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, the ACCC, Thrive By Five and Early Childhood Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I support this bill as one step towards quality, accessible and affordable early childhood education and care. Early childhood education and care is important for kids and families. Like workers in many traditionally feminised industries, childcare workers are underpaid. We need to attract a quality workforce to educate and care for our kids, and paying them better is a good start. There are a few issues with this bill that I hope are addressed in the current Senate inquiry. In particular, the bill takes a short-term approach and doesn't allocate money to the special account being established, so it's kicking the can down the road on longer term reform and costs. The broad powers in the grant-making laws leave a lot to the government's discretion. So it's appropriate that the bill be reconsidered in a few years in light of a number of reviews currently underway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While you couldn't say that the bill will have no inflationary impact, increasing the pay for our lowest-earning women seems an appropriate decision. Having more women here in parliament means that we are starting to correct the long-term gender bias in how we value different types of jobs. Paying childcare workers better is a good step, but I urge the government and the opposition to be bold in thinking about universal childcare access as a step to a better educated population and greater workforce participation for women.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I want to thank the member for Curtin for her typically thoughtful discussion with regard to this bill, the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024, that is before the parliament. It's a really important one, Speaker. You and I are Labor people who got into parliament to try to fight inequality and make sure that the quality of life of people in our country isn't defined by their income or indeed by the family that they grew up in. I think when you looked at these matters of social justice and inequality a generation ago you probably would have looked at wage justice and these fundamental things that affect the lives of Australians as adults. But the more we understand about how the life cycle of poverty continues across generations the more obvious it is that the best time for us to focus on is those first thousand days in a child's life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't need any more evidence about this point. There is study after study here in Australia and overseas that show us that, if we intervene in the life of a child, we can radically reshape their trajectory just by making sure that they get off to the right start. That's got an element of health care. It's got an element of supporting parents who might be in a really disadvantaged situation. But probably the most important thing that we can do through politics and through this chamber is making sure that we provide really quality early learning to every single Australian child. They expect and deserve nothing less from this chamber and from this amazing country of ours than for us to be able to extend that generosity to young people by supporting them through those first thousand days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know about early learning in our country is that we're on a real journey here. We've had some periods of time where we've had Australian governments that have thought about this as merely child care, someone taking care of your kids while the families went to work. We as the Labor Party and a Labor government have been working over a number of decades now to really switch the mindset up here. This is not just about looking after children; this is about starting their journey of education in the most positive and powerful way while they take those first steps as really young children and babies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that really sticks in my mind in the work that I have done in this area is looking at the different ways in which children who grew up in really advantaged families and really disadvantaged families experience language. There are some studies that have been done overseas that show that there are literally 20 million fewer words heard by children who grew up in very low income and disadvantaged households versus children who grew up in different kinds of households. As Australians, we can't tolerate these things. We've got to intervene, and it is certainly the role of government to reach in and try to give every support and assistance to those children to make sure that they're standing on a platform of support of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the parliament is about the workers who support these incredible young Australians to get off to the very best start. I'm sure I'm not alone here, but one of the most absolutely fantastic things that we get to do in our work as members of parliament is visit childcare centres where these young Aussies are getting taught by these incredible people, who are spending every day going to work and helping children form their first words and helping them learn through active participation. I'm so lucky to see my three children have had that opportunity. These workers are as good as gold, but for too long the Australian people and the Australian government have not been giving them the rewards that they deserve. We know that they are doing essential work to help build a great future for our country, yet they are being remunerated as though that work were not important, and that's not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are on a journey here of making sure those workers in our economy—our aged-care workers, our childcare workers and our disability workers—are getting properly recognised for the support that they give to other Australians. I've got the government whip just behind me here, who has spent her life in education. Don't get her started on the value of educators! I really want to emphasise for the parliament and for people listening at home that Labor understands how difficult and important this work is. If you're a parent of young children, as I am, you know that it is no mean feat to go to work every day and try to educate a whole classroom of three- or four-year-olds, but this is what these people do every day, and they deserve to be properly remunerated. That is what this bill is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention some of the gender issues that lie at the heart of this. It's not something that the parliament is always comfortable talking about, but we've got to address this. We have one of the most gendered workforces in the entire world in our beautiful country of Australia. A lot of people wouldn't believe that, but, if you look at a type of work like construction, you'll find that somewhere around nine in 10 workers in parts of that industry are male. If you look at something like childcare workers, you'll find that almost nine in 10 of those workers are female. This is really important because what we see is that those parts of our economy where women are really dominant tend to be the most underpaid parts of the economy. Of course, we all understand why that is. Historically, women's work has not been sufficiently valued. For a long time, generations of people have talked about that work as though women were going to work out of the goodness of their hearts. That's not respectful, and it's not right, and that's why our government is trying to correct it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll make a final point. Over the last couple of days, the Prime Minister made a series of outstanding announcements about the other end of the education spectrum in making sure that young people who make the fantastic choice—a choice we want them to make—to go on to further study aren't penalised in the way that they are today, and that, for those fantastic young people who want to go into trades, we want to support you. The announcement to make 100,000 fee-free TAFE places available every single year will have transformative effects on our economy and on the lives of all of those young people who take that opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the parliament to know that it is not about picking out one year or one part of our education system; it's about saying that, as a government, we have a special role in helping our youngest Aussies get the right start in life, supporting them all the way through that arch and through to their TAFE training and their university education. As a government, we have an amazing offering on education. It's something that I'm very proud of as a Labor Party member and a member of this House for a long time now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  Early childhood educators do some of the most fundamentally important work in Australia. For too long, they've been underpaid and undervalued. Frankly, I am disappointed that this government could not dig deeper to offer more to them and truly address the issues facing the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill purports to support our early childhood educators, but it does fall a long way short of what is actually needed. These important foundational educators have been calling for a 25 per cent pay rise. This bill offers 15 per cent. Effectively, the offer is a two-year grant, with no guarantee of pay rises beyond 2028, and locks in a 4.4 per cent fee hike for families already struggling with the dire cost-of-living crisis. People—and I've heard from many in my electorate—are heartily sick of watching this government crow about back-to-back surpluses, as the Treasury did again in question time last time we were in this House, and then offering a pittance to workers and families while doling out massive subsidies and tax handouts to the wealthiest corporations. It's insulting. It's a kick in the guts for those who are overworked, underpaid and feeling left behind by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian early childhood education care is in a state of crisis. Educators are doing their absolute best to educate our kids while being totally squeezed. Every educator can tell you this, but the government is tinkering around the edges of this deep problem. Across the country, families tell us the same thing: child care is too expensive and too hard to access. One in four people in Australia have no access at all to early childhood education and care simply because of where they live. Families are waiting months, sometimes years, on multiple lists just to find a place for their children. Parents are being locked out of paid work, and their kids are missing out on the critical early years of education that set the foundation for their futures. In a wealthy country like Australia, it's cruel and, indeed, it is socially and economically irresponsible that so many families are missing out on this essential service—a right, even.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has proposed this bill in the hope that it can address one of the key issues of our child-care system—that is, acute workforce shortages. The Greens, of course, welcome the government's long overdue recognition of the importance of early childhood educators. This recognition is a critical first step, but there is so much more to do. It's high time our early childhood educators were recognised and received the respect and the pay that they're worth. Educators have been leaving the industry in droves because their wages simply don't match the importance of the work they do. Let that sink in. Educators cannot afford to be educators, and the government's response to this crisis is a short-term fix—15 per cent for two years, if providers decide to apply for it. What happens after that? Will it be the providers or the parents who foot the bill? Or will more educators walk away because they still cannot make ends meet?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government boasts about a 15 per cent pay rise, let's be clear, it still leaves our educators underpaid. This workforce performs the critical role of educating and caring for our kids in their crucial early years. It's a workforce that is overwhelmingly composed of women, as the previous speaker said, who continue to take home less than two-thirds of the average adult weekly wage. Even with this pay increase, early childhood educators will still be underpaid. In fact, with the current housing crisis, it would take an educator in this country 31 years to save for a home deposit—31 years! These issues are exacerbated in regional centres and rural areas that are already childcare deserts. Centres in these areas are absolutely struggling to attract and retain staff because of the crippling housing prices, rising rents and the poor pay and conditions right across the sector. The combination of low wages and unaffordable housing only worsens the childcare drought across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government is serious about addressing the workforce crisis, the answer is simple: pay our educators properly. So far this year we've had two government commissioned reports on child care. Two of them, by the ACCC and the Productivity Commission, have been released, and both of them confirm what we already knew—that Australia's early education system is in crisis. We cannot fix Australia's childcare system if we cannot secure a sustainable workforce. And we cannot secure a sustainable childcare workforce unless our undervalued, underpaid early childhood educators are given a decent wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Educators have fought long and hard for a 25 per cent pay rise. They know that's what they need to stay in the industry. If we want high-quality, universal early years education and care we must invest in the workers. We need to make sure families are not being left behind due to lack of access and rising fees amid a cost-of-living crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have long campaigned for the cruel and unfair childcare subsidy activity test to be abolished because we recognise that a genuinely universal and high-quality early education system doesn't discriminate based on a parent's income. This is a test that keeps 160,000 children locked out of an early childhood education. The same test keeps around 40,000 parents out of work. It's a test that prevents the most disadvantaged kids from accessing an early education because it is linked to arbitrary work or study requirements. This test could be scrapped with a stroke of a pen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens have repeatedly asked the government if they will listen to parents and the childcare sector's calls to abolish this childcare subsidy activity test. And the government has repeatedly said it was waiting for the Productivity Commission to release its final report. Well, the Productivity Commission report released a month ago backs the Greens calls to abolish the activity test. So, Labor, what are you waiting for? Families just can't afford to wait. Educators can't afford to wait. The government is not listening to families or to educators. Our childcare system is in crisis and it cannot be fixed with bandaid solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mature, just and practical society, if we want all kids to have the best start in life, we must invest in our educators. The Greens want to ensure early childhood educators have well-paid and secure jobs. The government should listen and respond to this important campaign for the 25 per cent pay rise they deserve and for which their unions have been calling for ages. We have a clear plan to make the transformative change needed to fix the patently inadequate system of early years education and care here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the government is making a small first step, recognising educators aren't paid enough. Now it must commit to further steps to fix our childcare system and to pay our educators what they deserve. After all, early childcare educators are doing some of the most important work in our communities—educating our kids, the groundwork for a thriving future for them and for Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  One of the deepest commitments of the Australian Labor Party underlying everything we do is our determination that everybody deserves a fair go. Doing what can be done to ensure that is the decent thing to do, it's also the smart thing to do. No society should waste the potential of people. Everyone should be given the chance at least to realise their potential. Ninety per cent of the development of our brains occurs in the first five years of life. Where that's forgotten or neglected, the stage is set for underachievement as individuals and as societies. That development in our first five years comes from the complex interaction between what we inherit from our parents and the nurture we do or don't receive in our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every young child learning to walk and talk is on a pathway. That pathway provides the stepping stones and the foundations for the rest of their life. The people who help them along the path are doing immensely important work. It isn't easy, it certainly isn't unskilled, and it absolutely is not something that everybody can do, for every child is unique. That's a challenge—a wonderful challenge, but a challenge just the same. To all the students now sitting in the gallery: please take that in the way it's intended, as an absolutely positive message. When a child interacts with another child, there are more challenges, and they don't always get along. They're not born knowing how to play nicely or even necessarily interested in learning how, and they are not born knowing how adults want them to behave, as I'm sure some of the students in the gallery might attest. They're capable of resisting, with all kinds of creativity, any ideas about behaviour that don't sound agreeable to them. Even the most agreeable have their days—the days when they're just not in the mood to be cooperative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Knowing how to understand and respect all that individuality requires much more than being good with kids. It's knowledge requiring observation, reflection and adaptation. Knowing what to do and say in all those situations where children are learning behavioural skills of all kinds requires insight, wisdom, and emotional and intellectual maturity of a high order—and uncanny patience. We are talking about specialised knowledge and skills of immense importance to Australia's future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time the people who possess and develop those skills were treated with the respect that they deserve. The bill setting up the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers Special Account will deliver a 15 per cent pay rise for up to 200,000 early childhood educators across our country. We would, of course, like to deliver it to them right now, but unlike our predecessors we're committed to sustainability in all its aspects, which means delivering budgets that do what can be done when it can be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My hope for this election coming is that voters realise that the coalition couldn't get a budget in surplus while doing virtually nothing to solve Australia's problems or even trying to face them and, conversely, that Labor has managed to get that budget in surplus while working on solutions to real-life problems in real time. Our early educators now will get a 10 per cent pay rise from December this year. That's at least $103 per week. The further five per cent pay rise will come in December of next year. The Productivity Commission gets it. They advise that the first step in building a universal early education system that is affordable and available for more families is a pay rise for those who make it happen. It's good for workers, it's good for the kids, it's good for families, and it's great for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already instituted policies which are seeing 30,000 more early educators working in the sector than before we came to office. That's part of decisive steps that have seen 860 more early education services and 68,000 more children in early education. We need to encourage more of our early childhood education and care workers to stay in work that they entered with such enthusiasm, we need more to return to the field that they know and that they understand, and we need more people to consider a career in early education—a long-term, fairly rewarded and sustainable career. We'll also ensure that this will be affordable for parents by capping fees and constraining fee growth. This will be set out in a legally enforceable agreement between the Department of Education and early childhood education and care providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes we've made under Cheaper Child Care have, in fact, already cut childcare costs for more than one million families. This can be done while ensuring that the people who care for children are respected, encouraged and properly rewarded. It's part of a wider commitment to removing the undervaluation of wages in feminised industries. We need to ensure that women who work in industries where the majority of workers are other women aren't treated as though they deserve less pay. There's a peculiarly obnoxious set of attitudes behind this—a strange kind of logic, which seems to be that, if women are doing a job, it can't really be that skilled. Where those attitudes have prevailed, the recruitment and retention of skilled workers is in serious difficulty. No matter how dedicated you are, you do need to make ends meet for yourself and for your family. When we have a shortage of skilled workers in early childhood education and care, we have families who aren't able to give that education and care to their children, and, when that happens, we have children who aren't able to access the same opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 50 years, the Australian Labor Party has introduced universal health care, in the form of Medibank and then Medicare, and universal superannuation. Those great steps forward, which are taken for granted now, changed the health of Australians and the financial prospects of Australians on their retirement. They're still a work in progress, and they always will be. We'll never stop working to make them better as times and technologies change. We're now working to chart the course for universal early childhood education and care. Labor doesn't drift with the tides or stand screaming into the wind; we chart courses. After much discussion—hours and weeks and months of it, believe me—we work out what we believe is the best, most effective way forward. We believe in big dreams, big plans and big goals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, some people with big dreams, plans and goals don't achieve anything much at all. For individual human beings, that can be caused by sheer bad luck. Governments don't have that excuse. We have to understand and focus upon the realities of today and the challenges of the future, and we're serious about it. We're in the reality business. We've learned what you need to do to make things happen. Grand statements like those that the member for Ryan just made in her 10 minutes won't do the trick. We actually have to listen to others, learn and think and then act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How, in practice, do you achieve your goals? We're not going to be able to deliver universal early childhood education and care without addressing the problems of workforce shortages, and we can't do that without a legal framework for the establishment and operation of a special account. This one is the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education Care and Workers Special Account, which will be used to administer grant funding for the Early Childhood Education and Care Worker Retention Payment Program.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are. The grants will be paid as an interim payment while the Fair Work Commission finalises its gender undervaluation review of priority awards. These awards include the Children's Services Award 2010. The government also needs to consider the ACCC and Productivity Commission reports. We've been around. We know the drill. Perspectives and wisdom come from everywhere. You have to pay attention, you have to ask and you have to listen. We listened to service providers, educators, unions and advocacy organisations. We listened to parents and children.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill considers and respects the rights of parents and children under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. For those who don't know it, this convention, adopted by the UN in 1989, declares our recognition of 'the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family'. It declares our belief in the importance of the 'full and harmonious development' of a child's personality and the need to have children 'fully prepared to live an individual life in society'. It understands that children need 'special safeguards and care'. Those special safeguards and that care include the necessity of ensuring:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia made that promise, and we recognised the right of everyone under article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966 and coming into force in 1976, to 'the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work'. Article 7 specifically recognises the right to:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay for equal work.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of ensuring another article 7 right, which is 'a decent living for themselves and their families'. The grant opportunity guidelines will impose conditions on providers to pass on all funding to early childhood education and care workers in the form of a remuneration increase. The guidelines will also provide a mechanism for workers to legally enforce their rights and their entitlements.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  I do take great pleasure in joining the debate on the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024. In doing so, I would note this is one of those occasions where there is a high degree of agreement across the chamber in relation to the importance of the issues we're addressing in this bill. I also want to recognise that I think every member in this place would have a shared passion for ensuring that all young Australians have an opportunity to achieve their full potential and that investing in our families, supporting families and allowing them to support their children in fulfilling their dreams and aspirations are, in fact, a core business for the federal parliament of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll make a couple of general observations. In my role as shadow minister for education and also as a local MP now for 16 years, I've had a great deal of consultation with people around Australia and across Gippsland in relation to the issues surrounding early childhood education and care. It struck me over that period of time that it's quite ironic that we like to almost deceive ourselves as Australians in that we say the people we care about the most are our young people, that we really care about our old people, ageing and elderly, and that we really care about people with disabilities, but the people who are employed to care for those older Australians, younger Australians and people with disabilities are often the most poorly paid people in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a deception on ourselves, and that's why I do welcome many aspects of the bill before the House because it does seek to address some of the inequities in what is a predominantly female dominated industry which has been undervalued and underappreciated in the past. I do congratulate the government in that regard. Some of the worst-paid Australians are those who are involved in the care economy, and we do need, though, a very strong economy to ensure that taxpayers are in a position to provide the additional support that's required to fulfil our honourable and very desirable aims in this regard. So, as a matter of basic principle, I do understand and welcome the efforts to attract and retain a workforce in the childcare and early education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those early days in a child's life are critical to their future outcomes, whether it be through a formalised care environment through long day care, family day care or other models. Particularly for vulnerable children, the opportunity to have them in an environment where they can be assessed for any learning or developmental delays and then getting access to appropriate allied health care, whether it be speech pathology or whatever it might be, is critical to those long-term outcomes I spoke about at the outset of helping every young Australian achieve their full potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am worried, though, that, as much as those opposite have moved in a manner to address some of the pay issues for our childcare and early educators, they seem to have missed the point in relation to the families who live in rural, regional and remote locations. We're still facing an enormous problem with childcare deserts in many of the electorates that the people on this side of the House represent, particularly in the National Party. Sadly, where we live, in many of our communities, there are no long day care centres available, and whether or not you pay a childcare educator more doesn't really matter if there's no centre for the children to attend to in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So just increasing the childcare wages for the workers or even increasing the Commonwealth childcare subsidies actually doesn't address the fundamental issues for those people in those communities that we represent. I would encourage the government, the minister and people on this side of the House as well to keep working in a constructive manner together as much as possible to address the issue of childcare deserts so that all young Australians, whether they live in a rural or remote location, suburban or inner urban area, have the opportunity to achieve their full potential and have the opportunity in their earliest years to have access to child care and early education. I would note that the coalition and every member of this place—obviously the government and those on the crossbench as well—would recognise that our early childhood teachers and educators work extremely hard. We won't be standing in the way of a wage rise for those people but we still have some concerns about this bill and the policy going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no question that the government's policies in the last 2½ years have contributed to the cost-of-living crisis, which has made it harder and even more necessary for Australian families to have additional working hours and then draw on the need for child care in the first place. So we believe, as those opposite believe, that our early childhood educators do an incredible job caring for and educating our youngest Australians. The reality is that this policy is appearing now as something more of a pre-election sweetener and an effort to appease voters on the eve of an election period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as we saw on the weekend a very expensive announcement by the Prime Minister trying to buy some friends amongst the university set, we now have this policy which appears to be very focused on ensuring that a unionised workforce has access to higher wages in the lead-up to an election period. What concerns us is there is not enough focus on the real challenge in our rural, regional and remote communities. This is an issue that the government has been urged to address throughout its term in office and has failed to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Appearing at the committee inquiry in this legislation, Mrs Louise Martin from the Isolated Children's and Parents' Association stated that it would do nothing for the families that that organisation supports. When asked by Senator O'Sullivan: 'Do you believe this bill will make much of a difference to the families you represent without a measure similar to what we're discussing here?', Mrs Martin said, 'I would say about zero per cent, really.' Mrs Martin also noted the Albanese government wasn't doing much to increase access in the regions. Again, when asked by Senator O'Sullivan: 'Are you aware of anything the current government is doing alongside this bill that might address the lack of access in these childcare deserts specifically in the areas that you operate across rural and regional Australia?', sadly, Mrs Martin's response was, 'Not specifically. Occasionally there is money for mobile day care. Grant care funding is uncertain. Really, I don't see anything of significance that this government is doing to address this issue out here.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise those points because, looking to the future, we do need to be investing in our early educators and child carers. We also need to be investing in our families and in the important role that parents play in ensuring young people have the best possible start in life. Looking to the future, if we think we are going to keep on doing the same thing and get a different outcome in our rural and regional communities, we are sadly mistaken. We need more focus when it comes to early education and child care on choice, on access, and on flexible models that can work in our regional communities. When I say 'choice', I quite deliberately make the point that this is about respecting the choice that different families will make with their children's upbringing. We do need to make it possible for more families to care for their own child in the first place if that is their choice and it's possible in their circumstance. There's no judgement intended here, or no judgement should be given by anyone in relation to that choice. I respect the choice of families who need to access full-time day care, just as I respect the choice of families who have made the decision to look after their own children as much as they possibly can. But I'm disappointed that, throughout the past probably 20 years, there has been more of a focus away from providing that choice for those families who would prefer to spend more time—that most precious of all commodities—where possible raising their own children, rather than feeling obliged or forced or pressured in some way to have to access a childcare centre. I think choice is an important issue in this debate going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question around access is one that I've touched on already and it's one that every rural and regional member would be well aware of. In the childcare deserts that many of us represent, there is simply no opportunity to access a formalised care model which is subsidised by the Australian taxpayers. If we are going to be in a position to attract and retain a workforce in regional communities, whether it be in teaching, nursing, paramedics or policing, you name it, we need to be able to offer child care. It is very difficult to attract and retain a skilled workforce in a regional community if you can't offer child care to the families seeking to relocate to those communities. In that regard, child care and early education are services that enable those families to provide other essential services to the broader economy and the broader community. It allows people to get back to work, if that is their choice. Improving access to child care right across rural and regional Australia has to be a fundamental aim. It's become more challenging in the last few years as cost-of-living pressures have really started to bite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no question that a vast majority of families would not be able to pay their mortgage, cover their household bills and face all those increasing costs without having access to more than one income. Maybe not two full-time incomes, but maybe 1½ incomes or one income and some casual work, but they certainly need more than one regular household income to meet those bills in a lot of our communities. Having access to childcare services in more communities is critical for us if we're going to be able to attract and retain the workforce and allow our families to deal with the cost-of-living pressures in rural and regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I want to make is in relation to looking to the future. I mention choice, I mention access, and I mention flexibility. Flexibility means the bureaucrats in Canberra need to start listening to those smaller communities where the model of corporate care, a large day care centre, simply doesn't work. There's no demand for 100 childcare places in many of our towns, but there is still a need for the local nurse, police officer or paramedic to have access to care. We need to find some more flexible models that support those smaller communities. That may well be investing more in family day care and supporting infrastructure required for that. That may be to go to the local councils and ask, 'Do you have a public building that you could actively repurpose for a smaller day care, childcare, early education environment?' And we may have to assist them with their infrastructure needs. The corporate model will not work in many of our communities. Simply saying that we're going to keep increasing the Commonwealth childcare subsidy or increasing the wages for existing childcare and early educator workers will not overcome the challenge of access and flexibility in our rural and remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish where I started, on a very bipartisan note. I genuinely believe that across this chamber there is an enormous amount of goodwill when it comes to early childhood education and care workers and ensuring that every young person in this great nation has the opportunity to achieve their full potential. I urge those opposite to continue to engage constructively with this side of the House. Many of us have backgrounds in rural, remote and regional locations and believe we can assist in coming up with local solutions to what are very much local problems and in working with the minister to ensure that every child in Australia has the opportunity to achieve their full potential. I thank the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  The Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill before the House today will help address significant workforce shortages in early childhood education by supporting the delivery of a wage increase of 15 per cent for eligible workers over two years. A typical early childhood educator on award wages will receive an additional $103 a week from December 2024, increasing to at least $155 from December 2025. A typical early childhood teacher on award wages will receive an additional $166 a week from December 2024, increasing to at least $249 a week from December 2025. These are very significant pay increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wage justice bill also establishes terms and conditions of the ECEC worker retention payment grant, including a limit on fee increases. Let's be clear: the government does not accept centres seeking to raise fees for families as a result of these wage increases. Our measures put downward pressure on fees, helping to make ECE more affordable and accessible for families. The wage justice bill also encourages good-faith bargaining and the making of enterprise agreements in the sector. This will help support the steps the government has already taken to make ECE cheaper for Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2017, I spoke in this place when on the opposition benches to stand with the United Workers Union's Big Steps campaign and the early childhood educators of Tasmania in their struggle for better pay. I asked for the undervaluing of our early childhood educators by the then coalition government to end. It never did. I'll take the words of the member for Gippsland at heart that there is a good deal of bipartisanship in this place, but it took the election of a Labor government to bring wage justice to early childhood education workers. Unions have played a pivotal role in these changes, with the Australian Education Union, the Independent Education Union and the United Workers Union all advocating tirelessly for their members.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This wage increase recognises a group of predominantly female workers who have been undervalued for decades, despite providing the social, emotional, and educational foundations for Australia's next generation. It means educators will be able to stay in the sector and in the jobs they love.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a well overdue pay increase, and I am thrilled that the Government has acknowledged the professionalism of our educators … Early childhood educators play a crucial role in the learning and development of young children, and this recognition is a significant step towards valuing their contributions appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paying ECE workers fairly is a crucial step in charting the course to universal accessibility of early childhood education and care. The Albanese Labor government is proud to say to our early childhood educators and carers that we value you. We recognise your essential work, and we will continue to support you, just like you support the families who entrust their children with you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention and congratulate Tammy and Michael of Bagdad Education and Care, who in August were awarded national winners of the excellence in early STEM education for their project 'Will the ropes break under our weight?' Codeveloped with children aged three to six years old, this project involved children experimenting with ropes, physics and motion over many months to develop and test hypotheses around the properties of ropes and how to strengthen them. It's tremendous—and I'm sure the member for Gippsland will take note—that the highest quality early STEM education in the entirety of Australia took place in a very small town in my electorate. I commend the work of Tammy and Michael, who provide an exceptional service, locally owned, locally delivered to local children and families, and they deserve all the support they can get to ensure they can continue to provide their service to the community for many years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of Bagdad Education and Care reminds me that 90 per cent of brain development happens before a child reaches school age. Just think—in their project at Bagdad, those preschool children were learning physics. Fostering brain development with early childhood education has benefits throughout life, and I would argue it is one of the most important investments we can make as a country. The Australian Early Development Census demonstrates early learners are advantaged with significantly higher social and emotional skills. Early learners outperform their peers in physical, cognitive, communicative, socioemotional and adaptive developmental criteria. When they enter school, children who attended early childhood education consistently show higher test scores across mathematics, science and literacy compared to those who did not. ECE provides a massive head start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the words of the member for Gippsland to heart; there are significant parts of the country where there are not enough early childhood education centres. A good way to start is to make sure there's wage justice for staff. If you can attract more people into the sector, then it makes it much more attractive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conversely, a child deprived of ECE performs worse in every metric by nearly half. Before you say that kids in early childhood education are more likely to come from more affluent and stable homes, which skews the figures, I have to tell you that, no, that's been taken into account. The figures are consistent across socioeconomic categories. Children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds with access to ECE perform better than those without. It's the same story across all other socioeconomic categories. The common factor is the existence or absence of early childhood education in a child's life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2014 Australian government report called <span style="font-style:italic;">Access </span><span style="font-style:italic;">to early childhood education in Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> insi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ghts </span><span style="font-style:italic;">from a qualitative study</span> confirms that most parents are aware of the advantages of early childhood education. The study also details that many parents make the difficult decision to opt out of ECE because of concerns about cost and quality—and that is something that this government, elected in 2022, eight years after that study was published, is doing something about. Early childhood education and care workers are simply some of the most important workers in the country, but, for far too long, their pay has not reflected that. Just like in aged care, early childhood education is an overwhelmingly feminised workforce and, just like in aged care, the pay has been too low for too long. No early childhood educator should have to face the choice of leaving the job they love because they need a job that will pay their bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this bill, and with the other changes that we've implemented over the past three years, this Labor government is changing that. We are progressing towards universal early childhood education that will be accessible for every Australian family. We're not there yet; we have some distance to go; but we have started the journey. The Albanese Labor government has already taken significant steps to make early childhood education and care more accessible for more Australian families. More than a million Australian families are benefiting from our cheaper childcare reforms, which are already reducing out-of-pocket costs for centre based day care by 11 per cent, while preserving higher subsidies for families with multiple children in care. More than 1,400 families in my electorate of Lyons are included.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After just three years of Labor government, the early childhood education and care sector has grown by more than 30,000 workers. We haven't just arrested the decline that was occurring under the former government; we've turned it around. This achievement is a direct result of our efforts to respect ECE workers with higher pay and to work alongside providers to develop practical solutions for staff retention and strengthen recruitment and training. We are investing in the next generation of early childhood educators already, with our Australian Labor government providing more university places and more access to fee-free TAFE. We have provided sustainability grants for regional ECE centres, ensuring that no matter where you live—with some exceptions, unfortunately—there is a quality centre available to you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with Letitia at Discovery Early Learning Centre in Bridgewater, Lucy at Uniting outside school hours care in Bagdad, and Monica at Bicheno early learning services on Tasmania's east coast. All are receiving sustainability funding to ensure that access can continue for disadvantaged and regional communities. I heard similar stories from each of them: demand is increasing, but trying to find, train and retain employees is a constant challenge. Decent wages are critical to growing the workforce and providing the service. Services nationally have been delaying expansion plans, closing rooms and limiting enrolments because they simply couldn't find enough qualified staff. That has been impacting on the availability of early childhood education and care for families and limiting parents to shorter hours. As well as the impacts on childhood development, this means more parents, usually women, are staying home when they'd rather be in the workforce, contributing to both household earnings and national economic output.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In providing wage justice to ECE workers, this Labor government is supporting workers, supporting children, supporting families and, ultimately, supporting the national economy. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I rise to speak on the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024. The bill, which is supported by us, legislates a special account known as the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers Special Account to support a government funded 15 per cent pay increase for childcare workers across Australia. This will be phased in over two years, starting with a 10 per cent increase this December, followed by an additional five per cent next December. The special account will be used to administer grant funding for the Early Childhood Education and Care Worker Retention Payment Program. It does not set out the required wage increases or the specific conditions on providers who receive grants. Once the legislation has passed, the department will task Services Australia to build a payment system. That comes into effect in July 2025. I note that the cost of this bill is $3.6 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think people across the chamber have expressed how important early childhood education is. It's something that many of us have had experience with and talked to our constituents about. It's certainly something that I've gone through, with two children who went to early childhood care, day care, three-year-old kinder and kinder after that. I can tell you it's one of the most important services you'll ever engage, for someone to care for the most important people your life: your children. I can remember going to a place which was then called Florina but is now called Little Stars and dropping off my daughter when she was about two or three years old and crying at the start of the day. You feel a bit bad but then you go away and come back—and it turns out she's had the most wonderful day socialising with the other kids and engaging with the early childhood educators. It was a great experience. So the coalition supports the pay rise for those early childhood educators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been going around my electorate talking to people about their experiences of early childhood and I had the member for Moncrieff, the shadow minister for early childhood education, join me just last week. We went around talking to constituents to hear their experiences, particularly in places like Seymour and Avenel. We got a lot of engagement from young parents who can receive the childhood subsidy but find there are simply no places available because of where they live. We spoke to a young woman, whose name was Larissa, who would like to pick up more shiftwork at Seymour hospital—and Seymour hospital would like her to pick up more shiftwork—but she's unable to do it because her family daycare place has closed down. She's on a waitlist, but she can't get her kids into an early childhood centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard that situation echoed in a place called Avenel in my electorate, where the proprietor of the local equine hospital came down to see us in the park and talk to us. She brought a number of her staff members. Some were mums and some were people who want to start a family. She's concerned that these high-level professionals will leave the region if they can't find childcare places. I think Labor's policy is very focused on metropolitan areas where it's viable to have these big corporate type centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to raise the issue of what we on this side call childcare deserts—reports have been written about this—where there simply aren't enough places for child care and it's having a flow-on because we're having trouble attracting and retaining a professional workforce because of that lack of child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to see policies focus not just on the subsidy. I note a couple can earn up to $533,000 before they no longer get a subsidy. I don't want to think that people who are earning high incomes and who have worked hard to become professionals and earn those high incomes should not get some assistance, but we are helping some very wealthy people to access child care. I'm not opposed to that, but we don't seem to have any focus on ensuring that there are more childcare places in regional and rural Australia, in places like my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really hope that we can come to a bipartisan agreement in this place. Yes, the wages need to increase, and they will. Yes, there need to be subsidies for parents, and people will have different views on the income level at which those subsidies should kick in or no longer be there. But, where there's not the equity of opportunity for people who live in regional and rural Australia because there are simply no childcare places, then we've got to really do something about that as a federal parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear 'cheaper child care' all the time in this place, and I know that there are more subsidies going into it, but parents are telling me that they're not better off because any increased subsidy that they're getting, whether it be for child care or energy relief or anything else, is being eaten up by inflation. So, unless the government gets on top of the inflation issue—and I don't believe they have got on top of the inflation issue yet; it has stayed too high for too long—parents and Australian families will continue to be worse off. I hear from parents who are saying: 'I've got to go back to work. I can find a childcare place. Yes, I'm getting a subsidy, but the interest rate on my mortgage or my rent has gone up. Food's gone up. Electricity's gone up.' So many things—health care is another—have gone up by so much that people are just not feeling better off. A lot of money is thrown at things in this place, and we have debates about that all the time, but I think the government has got one focus that it needs to get back on track with, and that's making sure that we get inflation under control. It's not under control at the moment. It has stayed too high for too long, and interest rates aren't coming down. It's putting people under serious pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's got a good record on child care. When my kids were in child care, the coalition was in government. We almost doubled childcare investment to $11 billion in 2022-23. We locked in ongoing funding for preschools and kindergartens. We made big reforms to the early childhood education system over 40 years. More than 1.3 million children from around one million families have access to the child care subsidy. Our targeted extra support introduced in March 2022 made a real difference. Childcare costs came down 4.6 per cent in the year to June 2022, and we saw women's workforce participation reach record highs at 62.3 per cent compared to 58.7 per cent when Labor left office. So I think we all agree that child care is a good thing. It helps young people. It helps their socialisation. It helps young parents—and I've been one of them—get back into the workforce, and that applies to parents of either gender. It does help young families. We support helping families with the costs of child care. We support a wage increase for those early educators. But I would like to see the focus of the policy more on making sure that we—if I could put it this way—sprinkle some water on those childcare deserts and make sure that there are some places there in rural and regional areas.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Early childhood educators hold one of the most important jobs in modern Australia. Each and every day, parents entrust their most cherished loved ones to these educators. In their care, children learn to connect and socialise in a safe, caring environment, develop skills in literacy and numeracy, and discover new ways to deal with the world around them. It is our early childhood educators who facilitate all these learning opportunities, guiding children to learn in a fun, safe and supportive environment. The benefits flow beyond our children. Our educators create opportunities for families. They create opportunities for parents to rejoin the workforce, care for an elderly parent or run a small business. They also give parents confidence and comfort that their children will receive the care, attention and quality education they need and deserve. That's why, day in, day out, early childhood educators and carers have our utmost respect, and it's why they deserve a pay rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024 is about just that. It provides a 15 per cent pay rise for 200,000 early childhood educators and carers. This increase is also the result of strong advocacy from unions, dedicated workers and their families right across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to recognise some of the outstanding advocates from my own electorate of Corangamite, in Victoria—champions like Raelee Fechner, from the United Workers Union, who has been instrumental in this fight for many years. Your advocacy for better outcomes for early years educators has been invaluable, and it has helped make this pay rise a reality. For far too long, early childhood educators like Raelee and her colleagues from across the nation have been asking for a fair wage that reflects their skills and expertise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that those voices were ignored by the former coalition government. But, despite these calls for better, fairer wages falling on deaf ears, they were continuing to raise their voices. But, now, the Albanese Labor government has listened. This is a victory for workers in a highly feminised sector, and I'm incredibly proud to be part of a government that made this pay rise possible. It is a pay rise that will change lives. It will open the door to possibilities that so many early childhood educators and their families may have considered impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, I know that many of these workers were considering leaving the sector, and this is not because they wanted to but because they simply couldn't afford to work in the sector they love. It was something that I heard often, but these workers are so passionate. These early years educators want a decent pay packet, and it is a challenge for them. So it is a celebration that we are providing these early years educators with a substantial pay rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a direct result of this pay rise and the cost-of-living relief our government is rolling out across the board, from tax cuts to energy bill relief, these workers are recommitting to the sector, staying in much-needed jobs that deserve our respect. Just as our government hopes this pay rise will encourage more people to stay in the sector, we know it will encourage more people to become early childhood educators. It must be said that there are around 30,000 more early years educators working in the sector today than there were when we came to office. But we do need more, and a 15 per cent pay rise will certainly help to attract more educators to the profession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to make this pay rise a reality, this bill sets up the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers Special Account. This account will allow the Albanese government to deliver a 15 per cent pay rise over two years through the ECEC Worker Retention Payment Program. It means a typical early educator paid at the award rate will receive a pay rise of at least $103 a week in December of this year, increasing to at least $155 per week from next year. That's around $7,800 a year. For a typical early education childhood teacher, they'll receive an additional $166 a week from December this year, increasing to $249 from December of next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, for early years educators who may be thinking, 'I love this job, but I can't afford to do it,' you can now embrace your job and earn more at the same time. For people who've left the job, perhaps you may reconsider and return to the job you love. Importantly, this wage increase will encourage more people to become early years educators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know early childhood care is a female dominated profession, and the Albanese government understands that, to build an economy that truly works for everyone, we must ensure it works for women. An economy that works for women must deliver wage parity. The Albanese government is committed to this goal. While we have made significant strides towards closing the gender pay gap, there is still much work to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that we are on the right track, with Australia's national gender pay gap now reaching its lowest point on record. Since the Albanese government came to office, it's fallen from 14.1 per cent in May 2022 to 11.5 per cent today. That's no fluke. It's no coincidence. It's because our government has taken action to ban pay secrecy clauses, modernise the bargaining system, enforce transparent gender pay gap reporting and deliver pay rises for the aged-care sector. And now, with passage of this bill, we will ensure a pay rise for early childhood educators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a move backed in across the board, with Ros Baxter, the chief executive officer of Australia's largest early education provider, Goodstart, stating:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We expect that [this] announcement will see qualified early learning educators return to our sector, while encouraging others to establish a career in early learning. This in turn will help make more quality child-care places available for families who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also speaking in support of this bill is Early Childhood Australia CEO Sam Page, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a well overdue pay increase, and I am thrilled that the government has acknowledged the professionalism of our educators … Early childhood educators play a crucial role in the learning and development of young children, and this recognition is a significant step towards valuing their contributions appropriately</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the point about recognition that gets to the heart of this pay rise. It is recognition of long hours at work; recognition of high piles of paperwork, often completed after hours; and recognition of the skills and expertise employed in educating our children—children of all abilities and capabilities. This legislation doesn't just deliver a pay rise for early educators; it delivers long-overdue respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also lays the groundwork for a truly universal early childhood education system. The Productivity Commission said that, if we are going to build a universal early education system which makes early education and care affordable and available for more families, the first thing we need to do is deliver a much-needed pay rise to the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of all of this, Deputy Speaker, it also delivers cost-of-living relief for parents and carers at a time when so many are doing it tough. As a condition of funding the wage increase, early education and care centres will not be allowed to increase their fees by more than a set amount over the grant period, with that amount set at 4.4 per cent up until August of 2025. That's informed by the work of the ACCC, which has been doing so much work with the government to monitor providers and prevent them from unfairly raising fees. This condition will be set out in a legally enforceable agreement between the Department of Education and providers. We will also set a cap for the following 12 months based on the work that the ABS will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Capping fee increases provides certainty to families and will help keep a lid on fee growth. It also builds on our Cheaper Child Care reforms—reforms that have already resulted in cheaper child care for more than one million families. Under these reforms, a family on a combined income of $120,000 is now paying about $2,000 less in childcare fees, and that should be a source for celebration. As the Minister for Education has said, we need to reform our entire education system to make it better and fairer and to help more people finish school and go to TAFE or university. This journey starts with early childhood education. This pay rise is an investment not just for early-years educators and not just in individual families but in our national productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I say to our 200,000 early childhood educators: thank you for the work you do and for your care, your compassion and your skilful dedication. But this game-changing reform doesn't just happen. It takes a visionary government—an Albanese government, a Labor government that understands the power of education as a catalyst to a better future, a better wage, better self-esteem and a better, more prosperous nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I rise to speak on the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024. It's difficult to make any argument against better wages for childcare workers, and I certainly don't intend to. This side of the House will be supporting these increases. But it is worth considering in this debate how we've got to this point and, probably more to the point, what the increase will achieve, given the current economics of the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This wage increase is to be 15 per cent over the next two years, with the first instalment of 10 per cent coming next month and another five per cent in December 2025. There are some conditions that are outstanding at the moment, and we're told there are more. At this stage the childcare centres and the companies that run them, the organisations, are unsure what the extra criteria will be. They know not what the changes will be, and it's supposed to start next month, in December. We can assume, maybe, that it's not 1 December. But, certainly, this needs to be in place by the middle of the month or so—six or seven weeks at the maximum. Yet the government seems to have not yet sat down with industry and worked out exactly how it's going to run.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a track record of doing exactly that, of making a motherhood statement—a grand announcement, if you like—and then trying to work out the detail afterwards. Only this morning I picked up the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> and it was telling me that the Labor government will make the decision, perhaps on Melbourne Cup Day, that the $7 billion investment in the military satellite program is to be axed. It was only 18 months ago that they made the decision. So, in 18 months, they made a decision to spend $7 billion on a new military satellite system for Australia and then walked away from it. This has the feel of <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Hollowmen</span>. They make the big, bold announcement without considering the detail of how on earth they're going to get there in the endgame. There's been a whole host of Labor policies across the board that have been in this ilk. One would think that this one will be delivered, because at the end of the day they're dealing with taxpayers' dollars and a known number of workers, but it is running it down to the line. Why on earth wasn't this work done when the policy was announced back in August so that organisations—companies, councils, community organisations—that run these daycare centres can make ongoing, concrete decisions on what they know will be the situation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The higher wages for childcare workers and carers were announced, as I said, on 8 August. And I read in the government's notes that this program will run for just two years. Then what? What happens after that two-year period? It gets us past the next election, sure. I understand that. But what happens after that two-year period? Does the funding just stop? At this stage that's exactly what it will do, on 30 November 2026. Will the childcare centres or the parents then be lumped with this wage increase, which by then will be well and truly locked in? There won't be any going back on wage increases, and I don't think anyone would be suggesting that. But it becomes a question then of who will pay for it and how it will be paid for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem when government starts subsidising anything, but certainly wages, is how they get off the sticky paper. If wage increases are not accompanied by efficiency gains, in the end it can only come out of the taxpayers' pockets and out of the industries that drive the economy. By that I don't mean to downgrade any industry but what we would have called, when we went to school, the primary and secondary industries, the ones that create wealth. A wage increase for a government funded workforce can only come at the expense of others. The problem with these jobs in particular is that this government has no focus on driving productivity at the same time that it makes the wage increases. That is dangerous for the books of Australia and our underlying success in the longer term future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the lowest paid childcare worker at the moment receives around $24 an hour, and that's somewhere less than $50,000 a year—I'm assuming a 37-hour week or thereabouts, which is $46,000 or $47,000. That's no princely sum for somebody who's well educated in their area. If we want good people to work in that area, I think we ought to accept the fact that it's got to have a higher wage. But there needs to be more focus on how child care is delivered in this nation so we don't fall into this trap of just throwing more money and not getting a different result out of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rub is that while this wage is going up, the cost of living is exploding. The government has actually been forced into having to take this step because people have been falling out of child care. The cost of living is increasing exponentially, it seems. I went to a suburban supermarket the other day. It's on the eastern side of Adelaide; I'll admit that. It was $85 for a kilogram of undercut steak—85 bucks. Gee whiz! That's just about out of reach for most, I'd say. It was $16 for sausages. If people think that the cost of living's only going up by three or four per cent, have another think. The things that families buy—electricity, council rates, insurance, education—are all going up by greater amounts than the headline inflation rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This wage increase will be welcome, but it will be eroded quite quickly unless something changes in the way this economy is being managed. It's worth recalling that in 2023 the government put $3.6 billion into child care for reducing subsidies. The subsidies for anyone under $83,000 a year went from 85 per cent to 90 per cent. Effectively, the parent had a reduction of 30 per cent of their payment for the child care. Everyone welcomed that, saying, 'What a wonderful outcome.' But what's happened since that time? This extra $3.6 billion has gone into the sector, and the price of child care has gone up by 12 per cent. This was supposed to reduce rates for parents, so where's the money gone? We know that the centres aren't making a fortune and that it hasn't gone into profits. It's gone into the inflated costs of all the things that childcare centres have to buy, which are remarkably similar to those things that the parents have to buy—electricity; council rates; labour, in this particular case; and insurance. Most of those things are controlled or at least driven by government decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It hasn't had the effect that one might have thought or that the government certainly thought, and I wonder if they're actually across their economic brief well enough to understand what they're doing with the economy generally. We've seen another announcement today about HECS debts. This is off-budget money, for goodness sake. It actually turns out to be quite counter productive to the economy and all the people that have to work within it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have form here in the childcare sector. During the six years of the former Labor government—the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years—there was a 54 per cent increase in childcare costs, around nine per cent a year, and now we're having a 12 per cent increase in childcare costs. Over those six years, they averaged around nine per cent a year. Whatever it is they do to child care, they certainly know how to drive the cost of it up. If we keep driving the cost of these services up exponentially across Australia—don't get me started on the NDIS, the health sector or a number of other things—Australia becomes unsustainable. That's why these are serious issues. We are not opposing this wage increase, but the government needs to better understand what it is doing to manage the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another line in the government's statement that greatly concerns me—and I've spoken in this chamber many times about this. It says, 'This increase will not apply to family day care or home care educators.' They're not eligible. I'm here to tell you that around 30 or 35 per cent of my electorate lives in a childcare desert. It's one of the worst in Australia, and, in many of these towns and communities, family day care and home care are just the kind of child care that can be established in what I call these suboptimal populations. We know that if we have fewer than about 4,000 people in a community—if there are only 3,000 or 4,000 people in the community—a commercial model of childcare delivery is simply not viable, and yet the government seems to be completely content to allow that situation to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has put $3.6 billion into lifting the subsidies for parents and another $4.7 billion, I think, for higher wages in the sector, but not one dollar for a new place in the childcare deserts of Australia. Increasingly, we see governments—and we also saw the Royal Commission into Early Childhood Education and Care in South Australia, chaired by Julia Gillard—recommend that early years learning from three years of age should be available universally. It should be available to every child in Australia, yet we've got all these people living in communities that absolutely cannot access any kind of child care. It's holding the communities back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Companies can't recruit workforce to their operations, because, when a family arrives and asks, 'Where's the childcare centre?' they're told, 'Oh, we haven't got one; you'll have to take them to your own family,' and the family says, 'Well, my family doesn't live here. They live in Queensland.' It's creating a handbrake right across the economy. It's the government's role. I've said in this place many times that, in South Australia, we have a thing called rural care. It's where the Department for Education in South Australia stepped up to the plate with 18 centres across South Australia—I think 17 were in my own electorate—recognising that the best organisation to deliver child care in smaller communities is the education department. What we need is for the federal minister to speak to the state ministers about coming to an agreement about how you fill this gap. I have no doubt that, if you've got a population of fewer than 2,000 or 3,000 people, the education department is by far the best organisation to be delivering early years learning. They have schools, staff and campuses. They have administration; they have a gardener—the whole bit. It might run at a loss, but it'll run at less of a loss than anyone else doing it. That's the place for the federal government to step in and find common ground with that state government. I've got centres from all across South Australia in that boat. Towns like Wilmington, Booleroo, Kadina, Kimba—my home town—Wudinna and Orroroo are all looking for increased places or just some places in the childcare system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that I feel quite passionately about. It shouldn't be acceptable that people in the regions, in the country and in the rural areas get to pay higher taxes to fund a service that they can't access so people in the city can access that service at a cheaper rate. It just doesn't wash with me. It's like universal health care—if it's going to be universal, it has to be universal care. I know we're not going to have brain surgeons in every little country town in Australia, but how about we have doctors in every country town in Australia or we properly fund our hospitals so they can manage and not take away all the skills and responsibilities that small country hospitals have until they are very little more than aged-care services. These services are very important to these communities, but they shouldn't be undermined in their ability to deliver these services. I'll leave my comments with that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  I'm pleased to see that the coalition have had a change of heart and are going to support early childhood educators and support wage justice. I've been in this parliament for 11 years now and I remember one of the first acts of the Abbott and Hockey administration was to axe the national early years quality fund that was created by the previous Labor government to start addressing the inadequacy of pay and wage justice for early childhood educators. So it's good to see that, after decades of campaigning and decades of reform put forward by Labor, the coalition have finally got onboard and are going to help deliver wage justice for early childhood educators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sector that is highly feminised. Over 96 per cent of people working in early childhood education are women and it's one of the reasons why so many people have said that this is also about pay equality and pay justice for women working in this sector. Quite often throughout this campaign over the last two decades, early childhood educators who have degrees, who have diplomas, who have certificates, have compared their wage to the wage of male-equivalent industries with certificates and diplomas, and the numbers just don't stack up. For far too long, women working in this sector as early childhood educators have been paid minimum wage—the award—and this bill helps incentivise and encourage services and educators to get together to collectively bargain to lift themselves out of being trapped in low pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early childhood education sector workers do some of the most important work in our country. They work to give our children the best possible start in life. They work with parents to literally give meaning to that term 'it takes a village to raise a child'. Everything they do helps to shape the next generation. They embraced the National Quality Framework that was introduced by the former Labor government. They have goals and plans that they draft for each child in their education and care services. Yet for all that extra work they do, that individual planning that they do, the education that they provide for our youngest Australians, they have not been compensated or paid. They have not had the wage justice that they deserve. It took this government, a Labor government, to introduce these reforms to see them finally be paid what they are worth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to acknowledge some of the many activists in my local electorate who've campaigned for this for decades, some of whom have retired but are still excited to see that the next generation of educators will benefit from their campaign. For example, Roe Sally worked forever at the Goodstart Golden Square centre. Her passion for early years education is extraordinary yet she did it on minimum wage. She was so committed to the families and to the children but, equally, she was committed to the other women working in the sector and to the union that ran the campaign, the United Workers Union. If we wanted to keep qualified, good educators in the sector, we had to address the matters of pay. I want to acknowledge Ash and Lisa, who are still working in the sector. Lisa, who is now the director of the Bendigo Goodstart centre, says that she already has the list of educators and teachers that she is ready to call up to say, 'You can come back now; we've fixed the pay.' One of the key reasons why women leave the sector is because the wage that they earn doesn't pay the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often, I have heard, like other members of parliament on this side of the House have heard, that educators could earn more money working in retail or working in hospitality than they could working in early childhood education because it was an industry that was stuck on the award. Far too many great educators left the job, not because they didn't love the job, not because they didn't get fulfilment out of the work, but because it literally did not pay the bills. This bill and addressing wage justice will encourage women to come back to the sector. I know, through talking to my local centres, that is key.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just something that, anecdotally, we're hearing from people, from centres and from educators. It was also supported by the Productivity Commission's release of its report a few weeks ago that said that the first step to increasing access to ECEC for families is addressing and building the workforce, and pay is critical to that. Far too many services in our deserts—and I acknowledge the previous speaker, who spoke about deserts. I too even have them in an electorate like mine. It is a regional electorate with nowhere near the geographical challenges of the member for Grey's electorate, but even in my electorate we have desert areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These services have delayed expansion plans. They've been closing rooms or limiting enrolments because they just haven't had the qualified staff to open. I've been to many centres in my own electorate where the front room or the back room is closed. On the Building Blocks website, they have the capacity to take more children, but they refuse the enrolments because they know they don't have the staff or won't be able to attract the staff to open their rooms to full capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We conducted our own survey where we wanted to get a handle on how many centres this was affecting. So we rang all of our directors in our electorate and just asked, 'Is staffing an issue, and by how much?' All of them except for a handful said that they were not at capacity, because they didn't have the qualified staff required. The few centres that were at full capacity included the council run centres—where they are under a different enterprise agreement where they pay their staff more—and they were able to run at full capacity. So having qualified educators is linked to being able to expand services, and having wages fixed is linked to being able to have the qualified staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This wage justice bill does two important things. It will help address workforce shortages by supporting those workers by increasing pay, with 15 per cent for eligible workers over two years—as identified, 10 per cent this year and a further five per cent next year. A typical early childhood educator will receive an additional $103 from December 2024, increasing to at least $155 in December 2025. That's real pay justice that will make a real difference to household budgets. A typical early childhood educator teacher will receive an additional $166 from December 2024, an increase of at least $249 from December 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is critical if we're going to achieve another objective around kinder and make sure that all of our children have access to three- and four-year-old kinder before entering their foundation and prep years. The Victorian state government has set a bold plan in terms of kinder attendance, yet this state kinder funded program is struggling to keep up with demand. In my area, like most other areas of Victoria, it falls to the kinder program in the long day care setting to be able to make sure that every child has access to the kinder requirements that they need to transition into the foundation years of primary school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I also really respect about this bill and what I'm so pleased to see is that it's not just a straight increase to the award. It is about incentivising enterprise bargaining. It encourages good faith bargaining and the making use of the multi-employer bargaining stream that was introduced by this government. This fund will help support that legislation achieve its objectives. It will help support the steps the government is already taking to support early childhood educators and to see a fairer bargaining system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own family's experience, like so many in this place, I could not do this job without the amazing educators and teachers in my children's life. I have a three- and four-year-old, and we've had the opportunity to not just attend our local Annie Galvin, which is a council run centre where my children are today—although they'll be home by now and getting ready for dinner; they've also had the opportunity to attend the service here at Parliament House, the Capital Hill Early Childhood Centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to thank and acknowledge the great work of Melita and her team, who balance the unique position of parliamentarians and staff enrolling their children on a casual basis during sitting weeks. They manage the disruption of our children coming into their service, yet they don't miss a beat in the quality of the education that they provide. For my daughter Daisy, this was the first childcare service that she attended. She was born right before COVID, and, as you know, Victoria went into lockdown before any of the other states. A lot of the natural opportunities for young children, for babies and for parents with toddlers to interact in playgroups, rhyme times and tumble tots, all those things you usually do in the first 12 months of life, were suspended. So the very first children that Daisy met were at the Capital Hill Early Childhood Centre. I think of the impact that had. I think of the opportunity she had to be able to do what is just so natural for young children to do—to learn, to meet, to play and to interact with children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll be talking about the impact that COVID has had on Daisy's generation for many years. I do know that, during that period, our early childhood educators really stepped up. They really made sure that essential workers had an opportunity to go to work, to do what we needed them to do, and that their children were cared for. They were such an important part of the response. Yet they did it with not a lot in the way of thanks, particularly from the previous government. They did it on minimum wage. They did it while dealing with all the other barriers that came with the COVID years. There were drop-offs at the gate. There were masks all the time. There was the challenge of separation anxiety, with parents unable to stay in the room with their children that little bit longer. We had to communicate through apps and notebooks because we had to limit our engagement. But they did it, and they did it well. They made sure that those young children still had a quality education and a great experience, as well as the foundation to their stepping stones for being successful in their primary school years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses a campaign that has been run by our unions that have been involved in this sector for a long time. They did it not just for their members but for every child, every child that will enter into their service for years to come. I pay tribute to the United Workers Union, the Australian Education Union and the Australian Services Union for their passion and their commitment. I also acknowledge the amazing educators who just did not give up, from the days when they walked off the job to draw attention to this issue to working and to the delegations they've had in this place. They invite us into their service with warmth. Regardless of political colour, they will always welcome a member of parliament to share with them the work that they do and how critical it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is critical to ensuring we achieve our ultimate goal, which is access to universal early childhood education. I look forward to the work that our government will do to help achieve that. Until we have a situation where every child, regardless of their parent's income or postcode, has access to early childhood education, work is not done in this space. Critical to getting there is ensuring we address wage justice and that we are paying these amazing educators and teachers value for their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot think of another example in the Australian workplace or in the Australian economy that speaks more to why we need a parliament, why we need to address gender equality and why we need to address pay. I encourage all of those present to vote for this bill. I would again like to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the many educators and teachers in my electorate who each and every day give our children the great opportunity of early childhood education and the care that they require.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  I want to acknowledge the contribution from the member for Bendigo. How good it is to be in a House where we have parents of young children who are members of parliament and who can give lived experience of what it's like to be juggling work and early education and care and who can give us lived experience of the extraordinary quality of the early childhood educators that we have across Australia. So I thank the member for Bendigo for sharing her story just now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quality early childhood education is transformational. As an Independent member of parliament I support a childcare system where families can access affordable child care no matter where they live and no matter their income. Universal child care is among, I think, the most aspirational goals we as a nation could have. It supports the cognitive, social and emotional development of our children and it prepares them better for the challenges that life throws before all of us. For parents and caregivers, it helps makes it easier to balance parenthood and work and this benefits whole communities because so many moms and dads work in vital jobs particularly in our regions, whether that be nursing, teaching, psychology, running a small business or so many other professions and occupations. A thriving early childhood education sector should also create rewarding careers for those who work in it, the carers and educators who help our young people as they develop foundational skills that set them up for life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I support the intention of this bill, the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024, because it will make a difference and it will reward a workforce so often undervalued and underpaid. As a society, we do not do nearly enough to recognising the life-changing influence that early childhood educators have on our young people and all the skills that are required to do these jobs well. I want this to change. Like the member for Bendigo, I have met with many, many early education and care workers and professionals, and I absolutely value what they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements the government's decision to fund a 15 per cent wage rise for early childhood educators over two years. The minister said in his speech that a typical early educator will receive a pay rise of at least $103 per week or around $7,800 a year. That will make a difference to the educators and teachers contacting my office who are struggling with the cost of living or, indeed, finding suitable housing. Some are even considering leaving the children and centres that they love for better-paid jobs elsewhere, and we just can't allow that to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the bill creates a special account to be called the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers Special Account which will hold money for the purpose of delivering pay rises over two years through the worker retention payment program. Secondly, the bill will enable the minister to establish a grant program that funds childcare providers to pass on wage rises through their regular pay rise system. This will mean that early childhood educators won't be required to do anything. The pay rise will appear automatically in their payslip. The creation of a grant program will also enable the government to limit childcare fee increases to less than 4.4 per cent over the next 12 months. This will mean that the wage rise will be passed on in full to employees and won't see price rises for young families trying to access child care. That's really important because this is already so difficult for people in my electorate. However, the wage rise provided by this bill is only temporary. The bill also creates a sunset clause to reflect the pay rise is only for two years. This means the government has two years to ensure that sustainable and long-term wage rises for the childcare and education sector can be delivered. We simply cannot find ourselves in a situation in two years time where a sector seeking to grow and expand is then facing a 15 per cent drop in wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while I support the intention of this bill, it's a short-term fix and, at this point, is not the long-term solution that we need. The government says that this bill will deliver an interim payment while the Fair Work Commission finalises its gender undervaluation review of priority awards, which includes the Children's Services Award. The government is also considering longer term funding arrangements as part of its response to the recent Australian and Competition Consumer Commission and Productivity Commission reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an independent MP scrutinising this plan, this raises some questions for me. How will this future transition be managed? As I said earlier, I support the intention of this bill, including plans to limit price increases to 4.4 per cent over the next year but I do ask the question: how would the limits of price rises be implemented in an inflationary economy? If inflation increases to more than 4.4 per cent then there could be severe impacts on the viability of childcare providers. I've heard from childcare providers in my electorate who really are very worried about the impact on their viability because the costs of providing high-quality care are still rising. The additional burden of administering wage rises on behalf of employees will only add to their mounting pressures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government this week announced that limits on fee growth for 2025 will be determined by a new childcare cost index being developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the A<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">BS,</span> we at this stage have little understanding of what this index will look like and how it will work. And given the recent experiences that I've had in my electorate of outside school hours care providers, I am concerned about the government's ability to successfully implement this program, so we need to watch this. Nonetheless, we need these wage rises because providers tell me the lack of staff is the overwhelming reason they cannot meet the demand for child care in the regions, and we've heard this today in this House from various members of parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The care industry has been undervalued for too long in our society and we see the evidence of that in the wages paid in sectors like early childhood education and care, aged care and disability care too. These are sectors with highly feminised workforces doing skilled work and, as a community, we are finally waking up and realising we cannot manage without these people and we certainly cannot manage without the high quality of the work that they deliver. A Jobs and Skills Australia report released last month found that the early child care and education workforce would need to grow by an additional eight per cent to satisfy estimated unmet demand for early childhood services. Across much of Australia, particularly in the regions, there are simply not enough educators to keep up with demand. And without enough early education and care workers, we don't have enough places available—you can see the pattern. I hope that, by increasing these wages, we will attract new workers to the sector and retain the workers who are already providing this invaluable and skilled care and education. Again, I commend the minister and the government on the work they are doing in the training of early education and care educators through TAFE; it is really important. I've met many of these students who are working in the sector and undertaking the studies, sometimes online, sometimes in person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While child care is a family responsibility, we know in reality it is mothers who are disproportionately affected when child care is unavailable or difficult to obtain. There wouldn't be a woman in Australia right now who wouldn't smile and nod when they heard that. Take the story of Rebecca from Beechworth in my electorate. Rebecca wrote to me, sharing that her son was waiting so long for a childcare place to become available that he started school before he could attend child care. That is, quite frankly, absurd. I hear from mums driving their children 20, 40 or 60 kilometres to neighbouring towns so they can find a centre with availability. I speak to mothers who drive between different centres and who share between centres in order to get care, and this really does have real tangible impact on female workforce participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent ABS data showed that a lack of child care is the No. 1 reason stopping women from entering or re-entering the workforce. When families cannot access child care, women pay the price, losing out on career progression, superannuation and social connection. The data is clear—it's crystal clear: a lack of child care is creating a motherhood penalty that holds women back, and we need to fix it. That's why earlier this year, I hosted two playdate events with The Parenthood, one of Australia's leading advocacy groups for a better and fairer childcare system. These playdates informed The Parenthood's recent report on childcare shortages in regional, rural and remote Australia. The findings, while shocking, were actually quite unsurprising. What I heard at the playdate events in Wangaratta and Wodonga was that our childcare system is not working for families in north-east Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amy in Wangaratta is studying to be a nurse. There are not enough childcare places in Wangaratta to accommodate her son. As she told The Parenthood:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Twice a week, I drive 50 kilometres—about 40 minutes each way—to Yarrawonga. I study at the library in Yarrawonga while my son is at daycare, as the driving time and cost would add up if I returned to Wangaratta.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, day in, day out, Amy is having to make hard decisions about cost and time versus care and connection. Like so many families, Amy is pushed to the brink of burnout because her family cannot access the child care that they need close to where they live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hannah, in Wodonga, had attained high standing in her profession. She has a mortgage, and, when she and her husband had their first child, they had prepared as best they could and put themselves on waiting lists when their child was still in the womb. So you can imagine their shock when the time came to go back to work and they could only get care for three days a week across two different centres, and they live in the biggest town in our electorate. Keep in mind that, in Wodonga, there are 2.4 children for every available childcare place. Because extra care cannot be found, Hannah has reduced her work to four days a week, so Hannah's income is reduced by 20 per cent each and every week. She misses out on 20 per cent of her superannuation. She could be passed over when promotions arise. This is why we need a childcare system that works for all of us but especially for mothers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, I have little reason to trust that, when it comes to implementation of policy in this area, the government will be up to the job. In recent months, I've become aware of a widespread and extremely concerning situation in my electorate of Indi. The fourth round of the Community Child Care Fund saw 75 per cent of funding disappear from Indi. This is funding that supports outside-school-hours care in places like Yackandandah, Whitfield, Greta, Benalla, Moyhu, Mount Beauty and Rutherglen. If you've never heard of those names, look them up. They're tiny, beautiful places. Some of them are quite remote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these services have received this funding for more than a decade. To lose it so suddenly has come as a shock to principals, families and educators. Indeed, it's sent a shockwave around the whole community because, if we see these services close, parents won't be able to work if they can't find alternative care. Some parents may be forced to move their kids to schools in larger towns where they work, because the small rural school simply won't be an option if they can't provide after-school care. For these schools, then, that risk is existential—lose children, lose teachers, lose viability. It could exacerbate the gender pay gap, because we know it will be disproportionately mothers who will drop those shifts or days at work to provide this care if those OSHC services close. It could also exacerbate broader workforce shortages, with so many parents and caregivers in my electorate working in crucial occupations such as teaching, nursing and psychology. In fact, I've met two psychologists who have waitlists from Wangaratta to Sydney, and they had to drop the amount of work that they can do in order to take care of their children because the availability of child care is simply not there for them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I met with the minister as soon as my office discovered the extent of the issue with OSHC, and I subsequently asked the minister in question time what the government is doing to ensure those services don't close in my electorate. I went to see her again today, and I recognise both ministers in the House this afternoon. I've now helped to secure emergency funding for two of these services, and I hope more services will soon receive this desperately needed support. But I do say to you: that's one year of emergency funding. We absolutely need security for these services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my remarks by affirming my support for this bill, despite my implementation concerns. It will ensure that early childhood educators and teachers right across Australia will see a wage rise in December. This wage rise—make no mistake—is long overdue, but I am fearful that, at this point, it is only temporary. If this government is serious about fixing workforce shortages in this sector, then it needs to deliver on its commitment to long-term funding solutions, because this bill alone is not enough. It is simply one step among many that we must take if we're to fix our childcare system in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a regional Independent member of parliament, I will continue to be a strong advocate for regional families and regional communities. Childcare deserts cannot be allowed to persist in regional communities or any community. I'll continue pushing for childcare systems that work for families across the electorate of Indi, across north-east Victoria and, indeed, across the nation because I believe this nation is well and truly overdue for considerable reform in the early education and care sector, and I support the minister in her efforts to achieve that.</span>

                    <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  Significant, momentous, historic, a monumental moment, a lifeboat, proof that early learning matters and life changing: these are just some of the descriptive words that early childhood education advocates and workers have used to describe this government's 15 per cent wage increase. I'm proud to stand in this chamber today alongside my colleague the Minister for Education speaking on the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024, because I know early childhood educators have long been fighting for respect, for fairness and for a world-class early childhood education system for our children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start by acknowledging all the early childhood educators and all their advocates, who, for more than a decade, have been fighting for a wage increase for this vital workforce. When I first became a member of parliament in 2016 I signed a pledge, the Big Steps pledge, to support a pay rise for early childhood educators, as did many of my parliamentary colleagues on this side of the chamber. I did that for a number of reasons. The first reason was that I, as a single mother, relied very heavily on early childhood education and care. I know I owe the educators who gave my two sons a sense of normality, a routine, the nurturing and the education they needed at a significant time in their lives and in my life a debt of gratitude that I don't think I could ever repay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite recently I was at an Early Childhood Australia conference in my hometown of Perth. As I was leaving the room, at the back of the room a woman stood up and came to me. She said, 'Anne, do you remember me?' Of course I remembered her. She was the educator who looked after my two boys, Adam and Karim. There were tears on both sides as we embraced, and I said to her, 'I don't know how to thank you.' I said to her, 'You saved my life,' and I said to her, 'I don't know if you knew what was going on in my life at the time when you were educating my two sons.' She looked at me and she simply said, 'Anne, we knew; we all knew.' That is one of the reasons why I feel so passionately about recognising just how important early childhood education and care is, just how important the workers and the professionals who educate our children are and just how important their fight for respect and for wage equality has been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other reason that I signed that pledge was that I knew, though I did not know that I would one day be the minister, that it would take an Albanese Labor government to deliver that wage increase for early childhood educators. Here we are: a government that recognises this vital profession with this historic investment. When we first came into government we knew that the early childhood education and care system was working, but it wasn't working for everyone. It wasn't working for every child, and it wasn't working for every family. It wasn't working for every parent. So we embarked on reforming this important sector—a sector that was long due for reform, I will add.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The very first thing we did was make early childhood education and care more affordable. Latest data shows that average out-of-pocket costs decreased by more than 13 per cent from the June quarter of 2023 to the June quarter of 2024, following our government's Cheaper Child Care policy coming into effect. We also knew that cost wasn't the only barrier that families were facing in accessing early learning. And we knew, as we know today, that there is more to do. So we asked the ACCC and the Productivity Commission to each do a review, providing guidance on how we can achieve that vision of a universal early learning system, a system where every child, no matter who they are, no matter their background and no matter where they live, has access to quality early childhood education and care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that to get to the Albanese government's vision of a world-class, universal early childhood education system in Australia—one that is affordable, accessible and inclusive—we need a strong foundation. That foundation is a quality and sustainable workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This wage increase is important for families, for children and for the entire early childhood education and care sector across Australia. Ninety per cent of brain development occurs in the first five years. We talk about children learning to walk, to talk, to play and to share. That should be enough to tell us that, in those first five years, early childhood education is not babysitting. It's not wiping bums and noses. It's education. I want to say to the early childhood workers across Australia: the Albanese government sees you, we hear you, we acknowledge you and we know the vital and professional work that you do in helping our youngest Australians grow and thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early childhood educators are some of the lowest paid people in the workforce, and, as many have mentioned, it's a highly feminised workforce. Their pay, for far too long, just hasn't reflected the level of professionalism that they bring to their work and the heart that they put into educating children between the ages of zero and five. Anyone who's ever visited an early learning centre will tell you, just from observing the way that children interact with their educators and with each other, that there is more than just sitting and care going on here. There is a real level of professionalism reflected in those interactions that you see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission's final report confirms what the Albanese government already knew: that prioritising the early learning workforce is critical to any reform. That's why this bill is so important. The wage justice bill supports this historic 15 per cent wage increase for our early childhood education workers. It ensures that funding gets passed on to workers in full. It requires early childhood education and care services to agree to limit the increases they make in the fees they charge families, so it will help strengthen the early learning workforce without passing these costs on to families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in a practical sense, what does this mean for the early childhood education and care workforce? It means that 200,000 early childhood workers right across Australia will get more than $100 more a week in their pay packets in time for Christmas, and, by the end of next year, it means more than an additional $150 in their pay packet each week. It means a livable wage. That's what it means for early childhood educators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share a little story with the chamber today. I was getting off the plane in Melbourne just last Tuesday, A young man pulled me aside and he said, 'Thank you so much for what you're doing for early childhood educators—for the pay increase.' I said to him, 'Oh, are you an early childhood educator?' He said, 'No, my wife is.' I said, 'In Melbourne or in Perth?' He said, 'In Perth.' I said, 'Whereabouts does she work?' He said, 'Goodstart Joondalup.' He shook my hand and he said: 'This means so much for us. It means so much for her, recognising her work and her professionalism, and it means so much to our family.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those words that that young man said to me that day were echoed by Leane, who is a 19-year veteran of the sector. She's worked in early childhood education and care for 19 years. Let me tell you, Deputy Speaker: those early childhood educators who have devoted a lifetime to a sector while earning wages that are so low are just champions. They do it because they love what they do. Leane said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To be recognised as professionals and to have a wage that reflects that is a huge step forward, not only for educators, but for children and their families</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this bill means. That's what this wage increase means.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've listened to some of the contributions here in the House, and I want to acknowledge the previous speaker, the member for Indi, for her engagement on this and her devotion to this issue. But I have heard some speakers from the Liberal-National coalition, but also some speakers from the Greens political party, denigrating or downplaying the impact of this 15 per cent wage increase. I would say to those people: Go and speak to early childhood educators. Ask them what it means for them. It is significant for them because it means that, along with this government's tax cuts, they're able to earn more. They're able to keep more of what they earn. They don't have to take a second job. They can stay in the profession that they love. They're able to earn a liveable wage. They're able to make ends meet. As one early childhood educator put to me: 'I'm able to buy real food. I'm able to pay the rent.' This is not something that is insignificant. This is really, truly meaningful to the people that it impacts most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It means that we are on that path to building a strong, stable early learning workforce as we have more early childhood educators coming through our free-TAFE pipeline. I went and visited one TAFE in Perth recently. They've had a 400 per cent increase in the number of people doing a Certificate III in Early Childhood Education and Care. I spoke to those young people undertaking the TAFE course, who said to me: 'I wouldn't be able to do this if it wasn't free. I wouldn't have been able to afford it.' We're building that system. We're building that workforce. That's because we know that accessible and affordable early learning is critical to supporting more people, especially women, to have a choice when it comes to undertaking study, re-entering the workforce or increasing their hours of work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to my own experience and why I say that those early childhood educators saved my life. It's because they afforded me choice. They afforded me the ability to go back to study. They afforded me the ability to go back to work and to put a roof over my head and my children's heads. They afforded me the ability to provide for my children, an ability that I would not have had had it not been for those early childhood educators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents real cost-of-living relief for the household budgets of families struggling with the rising cost of living and it improves economic security for women. It's what the children of Australia deserve. It's what the families of Australia deserve. It's what the Albanese Labor government is delivering. It builds on a range of measures the government is delivering to support this important workforce. We've already increased the pipeline of early childhood educators, as I mentioned earlier. We've got $72 million in the early childhood education workforce package that's helping to retain the existing highly skilled early learning workforce. And now we're increasing wages, helping early childhood educators who have been struggling for so long, attracting more back into the sector and encouraging more people to take up early childhood education and care as a viable career option.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From visiting centres across the country and meeting with so many of our precious early childhood educators, I know that they love the job. But I also know that love doesn't pay the bills. We want to build an early childhood education system that works for everyone. That means that it needs to work for educators as well as for parents and, importantly, it needs to work for children. Every Australian—whether you're a parent, a grandparent, an aunty, an uncle or a great-aunty, as I have just recently become or whether you know someone who works in early childhood education or are an early childhood educator—can get behind this. Every Australian knows just how important the work of nurturing and educating our youngest Australians is. With that, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  I would also like to thank the minister for telling her personal story and also for her passion in bringing to this House this bill, the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024, that implements the 15 per cent pay rise for all of our early childhood education workers, who play a crucial role in providing children with a nurturing and supportive environment where they can explore, learn and grow. Through their expertise, they create spaces that guide children through essential development milestones and encourage the foundational skills necessary for lifelong success. These environments encourage curiosity and discovery, helping children not only to build cognitive abilities but also to develop socially, emotionally and physically. Early childhood educators are dedicated professionals who deliver more than lessons. They inspire a love of learning and cultivate an inclusive atmosphere where children feel valued and understood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In May this year, the Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth visited the University of Wollongong and met with the early childhood educators. The minister was an absolute rockstar when she came to Wollongong. Whether it was to meet with early childhood education workers or young people from our local high schools, she just shone. They absolutely adored talking to you. You're an absolute rockstar. She listened to the concerns and experiences of early childhood educators when they highlighted the challenges that were faced in delivering quality care and education in the Illawarra. These conversations emphasised the need for targeted reforms to ensure that the sector can continue providing high-quality education and care to all families while retaining the skilled workforce, especially in regions like mine in the Illawarra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024 is an instrumental piece of legislation for these workers. It not only addresses pay equity but also tackles broader issues such as workforce retention, early childhood development and family support. Despite their crucial role in the development of our children, these educators have historically been underpaid. Many early childhood workers earn wages significantly lower than those in comparable industries. During their decade in government, those opposite failed to take any action to address underpayment or the broader challenges facing the early childhood education and care sector. The Albanese Labor government recognises how important early childhood education and care workers are to our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wage justice bill will help address significant workforce shortages by supporting the delivery of a wage increase of 15 per cent for eligible workers over two years. For many educators, this could mean a rise of $7,800 annually, bringing their pay more into line with the important work that they do. This bill acknowledges that early educators are more than just caregivers; they are professionals who deserve to be recognised and compensated fairly. By improving wages, we are also investing in the quality of education for our children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our Illawarra region, access to early childhood education is strained due to the long waitlist for care. Many parents are forced to delay their return to the workforce because they cannot find affordable and available childcare spots. Belinda Jackson and Summer Finlay, two mums from the Illawarra, wrote a submission to the Productivity Commission inquiry regarding the issues that Illawarra families face accessing child care and the implications. They conducted a survey of 73 families around the Illawarra and found that over 33 per cent of respondents had lost more than $50,000 per annum due to the lack of availability of early childhood education and care. A further 49 per cent lost somewhere between $10,000 and $50,000 a year, with almost 60 per cent of respondents being on waiting lists for more than 18 months. This is affecting household budgets around the Illawarra, but it is also a loss for the local economy, with predominately women having to delay their return to work or work part time as a result of places in early childhood education and care centres. The staffing shortages in our local early childhood education and care centres are a contributor to these waitlists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill directly addresses these shortages by improving wages, making the profession more attractive and encouraging qualified professionals to remain in or return to the sector. For families in the Illawarra, this will help centres to increase capacity, offering more places for children. And the ripple effect is significant. When more children can access care, parents, particularly women, can return to the workforce sooner, boosting local economic activity. With better pay for educators, we can ensure that all early childhood education and care centres are adequately staffed and that children receive the high-quality care they deserve. Research has shown that the first five years of a child's life are critical for brain development. Educators in this sector support this growth, providing children with the cognitive, emotional and social skills they need to thrive in school and beyond.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some of the many workers and managers who are excited to see a wage increase in the sector. Others have said it is still a talking point in many centres as it will be changing the lives of those employed but also helping to attract more educators and teachers. Early childhood education and care centres have been delaying expansion plans, closing rooms and limiting enrolments because they can't find qualified staff. This is impacting on the availability and the cost of early childhood education and care for families.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most pressing concerns for families in the Illawarra is the rising cost of child care. Even with increased subsidies, families often find that costs outpace wage growth, making child care a significant financial burden. This bill not only ensures wage justice for workers but also implements a cap on childcare fees increases at 4.4 per cent per year. This cap will prevent fees from skyrocketing, providing much-needed cost-of-living relief for families across the country, including those in the Illawarra. By capping fee increases, the bill ensures that the benefits of the wage rises for workers are not undermined by unaffordable fees for families. Parents will be able to access affordable care secure in the knowledge that the government is taking action to prevent unreasonable fee hikes. For working families, this is a game changer. Affordable child care is essential for parents to re-enter the workforce, increase their hours or pursue further education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Illawarra, where many households are juggling the cost of living with the challenges of finding child care, this bill offers both short-term relief and long-term solutions. It is about much more than wages; it's about shaping the future of early education in Australia. By investing in our educators, we are investing in the success of our children and our society. Research consistently shows that high-quality, early education leads to better educational outcomes, lower rates of social disadvantage and stronger future participation in the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Illawarra, a region known for its resilience and innovation, we understand the importance of investing in people. When our children receive the best possible start in life, they are more likely to succeed in school and contribute meaningfully to their communities. This bill is a step towards ensuring that every child in the Illawarra and across Australia has access to the best early education opportunities regardless of their background. It is also a huge step in recognising the dedication, passion and tremendous effort of all early childhood education and care workers and the care that they put in every day for children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This increase will help build a bigger early education and care workforce that will, in turn, help to build a bigger and better early education system. This bill is a landmark step towards building a fairer, more sustainable early childhood education and care system. It addresses wage inequality for our educators, enhances access to child care for families and ensures that quality of care remains high. For the Illawarra, this will help to achieve shorter waitlists, more places for children and more opportunities for parents to return to work. It means creating a more equitable and just society, where the importance of early childhood education is recognised and supported.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the United Workers Union for their fierce advocacy for early childhood education and care workers through their Big Steps campaign to help secure this pay rise, and I would also like to thank all the early childhood education and care workers, especially those in the Illawarra, for everything that they do. You deserve this pay rise, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  The Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024 is a hugely significant step, and it's a sign that the Albanese Labor government understands early childhood development, understands our society and understands our future. My electorate of Macarthur has one of the highest growth rates in the country, and our fertility rate is well past that of population replacement. We're a rapidly growing electorate, the biggest in the country by population, and we have many young children and young families who require high-quality child care and early childhood education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to congratulate the Minister for Early Childhood Education, who has visited my electorate several times and has been an iconic figure in the development of early childhood education policy since we've been in government. I congratulate her on this bill. I also congratulate the Minister for Education, who, again, has visited my electorate on a number of occasions and has been a towering figure in the development of education policy in Australia over the last three years. I feel very proud that I've been able to have him and, indeed, the Minister for Early Childhood Education visit the electorate of Macarthur and see our wonderful kids and their families, who are the future of our country and our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the bill, of course, is to establish an account to fund grants that support financial incentives for early childhood educators by increasing their wages. This has been a long, long journey for me, as both a politician and a paediatrician. I love visiting early childhood education centres. They are really exciting places where we can see the potential of our kids blossoming with the support they get from our early childhood educators. I've been to just about every early childhood education centre in my electorate, and some outside the electorate as well, in almost half a century. My own children have benefited from the support of early childhood education workers, and I thank them so much for the support they've given my family and my patients as a paediatrician.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I say it's been a long journey, as a young medical student I was involved in a study that looked at brain development in young children and found that the brain development in terms of the number of neuronal cells was virtually complete by age two. The connections that come after that are in response to stimulation from the environment that occurs. We are to thank our early childhood educators for that stimulation and that support that they give our kids in early childhood centres around the country. The fact that we can see the wonderful potential of those children is a tribute to our early childhood education workers and to the families that support our children as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first part of this bill deals with a range of matters, including the object of the bill and provisions that establish the payment systems and the support and supervision of that. Our early childhood educators have done a wonderful job, but they've been underpaid for many, many decades. This has led to poor career structures. It's led, in many instances, to frequent staff changes. Anyone who's had children in preschool understands how important it is for our kids to have a stable teaching environment and teachers who are there for the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All six of my children have benefitted from early childhood education centres in my electorate of Macarthur, and they're all well grown now. In fact, we now have nine grandchildren, who have also benefitted from early childhood education. I love going and seeing my own children and grandchildren in early childhood education. I love seeing my patients, and I love to see the support they're getting and how they're growing up with the support of our early childhood educators. To have a plan where they now have a remuneration system that allows them to live a normal life in stable housing, to be able to feed their families and to be able to educate their own families is a really crucial step. It's a sign, as I've said, that the Albanese Labor government understands the huge importance of early childhood education and what it is doing for our children and for our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our society depends on our children having the best education possible, and we know that that education starts from birth. As a medical student, I was involved in one of the first studies that looked at brain development in very young children. In more recent times, I've been promoting the First 1,000 Days as an early childhood development program to see how we can stimulate the brain development and the overall development of our young children. That is a very important thing that we're only now beginning to recognise. It is so important for the future education of all our children. If we can build on this further, it will be of great benefit to our young children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many young children in the past missed out on the benefits of early childhood education, and we know that from talking to our teachers. It has been shown that children who start school at age five often develop language and skills much slower than those who've been to early childhood development centres. It is something that we need to encourage, and it's important to recognise that all children should start school on an equal footing. This bill, by getting proper remuneration for our early childhood centre teachers, will help stimulate the ability of people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to enter early childhood education. The bill establishes the mechanism for this, and we will build on it further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the ministers involved, and I look forward to visiting many more early childhood education centres to see the progress of my grandchildren and my patients, who are attending the preschools in the Macarthur region. I thank all of them—the teachers in the centres—for their support over many, many years of the early childhood development of those kids. I look forward, in the future, to seeing them prosper even further in our schools, our universities and our TAFEs. Our children deserve the very best. In centres around the world, we know that the very best centres provide ongoing early childhood intervention and support for children from a very early age, with a seamless transition into primary school. I'm very hopeful that will continue in Australia, provided we can build on this bill, make sure we have a stable workforce and make sure that workforce is properly trained and attuned to the developments of the 21st century in early childhood education. I commend this bill to the House. I look forward to its implementation. I congratulate the minister, and I congratulate all those early childhood intervention teachers that have been involved in getting this bill through the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I am reminded of the importance of good quality early childhood education and care when I'm confronted with its removal. Two centres in my electorate currently face closure, and three have recently closed, as churches, councils or other institutions leave the field by seeking other uses for their land. The common thread is that these have    all been community-led centres. These decisions leave families and communities shattered because the selection of a childcare centre or kindy is made so thoughtfully and individually, often based on interactions with staff, obviously the needs of the child, word of mouth and online quality standards, which are universally higher for community-run centres. Little St Margaret's Kindergarten, Ewing Street Kindergarten, Gardiner Preschool, Windsor Community Children's Centre, the Craig Family Centre, Chabad Malvern's early childhood education and care centre are places I love visiting to meet caring and impressive staff and curious children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, Windsor Community Children's Centre and Gardiner Preschool are fighting to survive. A campaign is underway to protect Windsor Community Children's Centre. The land on which this beloved centre is sitting on is being rezoned and sold. It is one of the few remaining not-for-profit centres in the City of Stonnington. It is a special place where children are nurtured, educated and prepared for their future in a safe and loving environment. Gardiner Preschool in Glen Iris is a quality community-run kinder that opened in the 1940s. It, too, is at risk of closure due to the Uniting Church's decision to terminate its lease. I am asking Higgins residents and people at all levels of government to visit these centres and have a look at their websites to learn about their histories and what they provide, and to support the campaigns to save them in whatever way they can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The educators and carers in these settings perform vital work and become part of our families. But therein lies the trap. They are not in our family; they are skilled professionals who should be paid fairly. Parents agree. Time and time again I have had parents cite the need to pay our educators better. They are concerned that their fees may not be getting to the workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Caring professionals provide the foundation for a caring society, from the cradle to the grave. Ninety per cent of brain growth occurs in those first five years—they are critical—underpinning the importance of high-quality early education and care, noting that the workforce, like in every other caring profession from teaching to nursing to aged care, is everything. The workforce is everything. But sector reform is needed because there is a shortage of workers. Providers have been delaying expansion plans, closing rooms and limiting enrolments because they can't find quality and qualified staff.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Labor came to office, the workforce has increased by 30,000, but more work is needed. <span style="font-style:italic;">The future of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">early childhood education profession</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Early childhood education and care workforce capacity study summary report</span> stated that Australia needs 21,000 more qualified ECEC professionals to meet current demand. ECEC remuneration is low compared to other competing occupations, which presents a significant disincentive to entry and accelerates attrition. Given that 92 per cent of the workforce are women, this is a gendered issue and it is close to the heart of this female-dominant government. I congratulate Minister Anne Aly and Minister Jason Clare for their work on this game-changing bill. It is a game changer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Change is needed not simply as a matter of fairness but to attract people to the profession and retain them. I have met educators who have been at centres for decades, some up to 25 years. We want the sector to be seen as a career destination, and remuneration is vital to making that a reality. High-quality child care and early childhood education are essential for increased workforce productivity, particularly for women, and for better biopsychosocial outcomes, not just education, for children. It's holistic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024 we are debating establishes a special account to fund grants to approved early childhood education and care providers to support a wage increase of 15 per cent for eligible workers over two years, and to limit fee increases charged by providers. This is the ECEC worker retention payment program. The 15 per cent pay rise will be phased in over two years, starting with a 10 per cent increase from December this year with a further five per cent increase from December next year. A typical early educator, paid at the award rate, will receive a pay rise of at least $103 a week in December this year, increasing to at least $155 per week from next year. For a typical early childhood education teacher, they'll receive an additional $166 a week from December this year, increasing to $249 from December next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be eligible to receive the funding for the wage increase, early childhood education and care services must agree not to increase their fees by more than 4.4 per cent between 8 August this year and 7 August next year. This will place downward pressure on fees. It will constrain them. The funding for this change has been set for two years to allow the Fair Work Commission to finalise its gender awards review, which is expected to overhaul the care and health sectors. Watch this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds on the government's support for the ECEC sector and Australian families, including the cheaper childcare measures, which injected $5 billion into the sector in our first budget. This in turn has made child care cheaper for more than a million families. Our children and parents, especially our mums, and our economy will be the beneficiaries, but it all starts with the workforce. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Bill 2024. This is a really important thing that we are doing here today, lifting the wages of some of the most important workers in this country. When my wife was pregnant with our second child, my oldest child, who'd been badgering us for a second child for a long time, was shown an image of the ultrasound of the little baby in the stomach. My colleague across the chamber would know how special that moment is. It is a really special moment. Jack, my older son, didn't know what he was looking at, at first, and we had to tell him that it was a baby. He said, 'Is it a boy or a girl?' We said, 'It's a baby boy.' His first reaction wasn't what we expected. The first words that came out of his mouth were, 'I can't wait to tell Kelly.' And you can guess who Kelly is. Kelly was his early childhood educator, the woman who cared for him and educated him when he was little before he started school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When that happened, at that moment, I think something clicked with me. I understood just how important our early educators are. In a much more powerful way, I understood what we get told in this debate and what we get told in this job, which is that everything that a child experiences when they're little—every meal, every smile and every book that gets read to them—shapes the child that they become. So much of who we are is made in those formative years, those early years before you even start school. I want to thank members who have contributed to this debate that have told that in such a powerful way, who have told us how our early educators not only help parents return to work and help them return to study. I think my friend Anne Aly said it more powerfully in this debate than anybody. They can save their lives, change their lives, put a roof over their heads and help them raise their family. I think that's not too strong a word.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So these are important people in our own lives, in our community, for our country, but you wouldn't necessarily know that from how they're paid. The truth is that early educators are some of the most underpaid workers in this country, despite the importance of the work that they do. This bill is about addressing that. It'll deliver a 15 per cent pay rise for up to 200,000 early educators across the country. That's a 10 per cent rise in just a few weeks time on 1 December and then a further five per cent rise from December of next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that mean in real terms? It means that, for a typical early educator who's paid at the award rate, they'll receive a pay rise on 1 December this year of at least $103 a week, and that'll increase to $155 a week from December of next year. That's about $7,800 extra a year in their pocket. If you're an early childhood education teacher, you'll receive an extra $166 a week from 1 December this year—only a few weeks away—and that'll increase to 249 bucks from December of next year. That's big. That is something that will seriously change the lives of those 200,000 Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just about those 200,000 early educators who are educating and caring for our littlest Australians right now. The Productivity Commission report that we released a couple of weeks ago makes the point that we need them and we need more of them. There are 30,000 more early educators working in the sector today than when we came to office. We need them to stay, but we also need more of them—many more. People who might be thinking, 'I love the job, but I can't afford to do it,' will, hopefully, think, 'Well, now I can.' I remember the day that we announced this with the PM. I dropped my little guy, Atticus, off at the centre where he goes. I said to Kerry, who looks after him, 'Have you heard the news?' She said no, and I told her. She said, 'Maybe I won't have to quit now.' That's the difference that something like this can make. People who might have been early educators but left the job, not because they wanted to but because they couldn't afford to keep doing it—people who might have gone off to work at the local supermarket or somewhere else because they could earn more money—will, hopefully, see in this that they can go back to doing the job that they love—more people doing some of the most important jobs imaginable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank everybody who has contributed to this debate, most particularly my friend and colleague the extraordinary Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth, Anne Aly. Anne, you have worked tirelessly for this. This is your victory. The real heroes of this story are the 200,000 people into whose pockets we're making sure that we put more money, but the truth is that it wouldn't have happened without you and without the Prime Minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the many stakeholders who have spoken in support of this pay rise that we'll be voting on in a few moments, like Goodstart, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With this $3.6B commitment the Prime Minister has demonstrated he is serious about delivering a truly universal early education system for all of Australia's children and families—because the first thing a universal system needs is a strong workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community Child Care Association called this measure 'life changing'. The Parenthood described it as 'historic' and 'decades in the making'. Sia, who works for Big Steps and was interviewed on ABC breakfast a little while ago, talked about her passion for the work that she does, and she said, 'That passion, if I'm honest, has been slowly dying, because we don't get recognised and we haven't been getting paid what we are worth. It's just like we've had it at the tip of our fingers and now we've finally got hold of it, and it's going to make such a difference for our industry.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee for their inquiry into the bill, and I welcome their recommendation that it be passed. This an important thing that we're doing here right now. It'll benefit some of the most important and some of the most underpaid workers in our country, workers who have one of the most important tasks: to educate and to care for our youngest Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide was established in July 2021 and its final report was delivered on 9 September this year. The purpose of the royal commission was to examine the tragic overrepresentation of current and former Australian Defence Force personnel in the data relating to deaths by suicide. Why does giving for the nation equate to a higher risk of taking your own life?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that, between 1997 and 2022, there were 1,763 known deaths by suicide amongst current- and ex-service men and women. That is a staggering and awful number. Each one represents a tragic loss for family and friends—a loss that endures long after funerals and memorial services have concluded. The Albanese government recognises the urgent need for action and will respond to the recommendations of the royal commission before the end of the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the ADF members, the veterans and their families who contributed to the royal commission, often reliving their own traumatic events in their resolve to improve the experiences of current and future service men and women. I thank them again for their courage in that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not a representative in this House who does not honour and respect the sacrifices made by our defence personnel, both past and present. When we look down Anzac Parade from this building to the War Memorial, we remember the connection between those who fought and died for their country and, through that line of sight basically straight through the front doors, under the Great Verandah, through the Great Hall, under the flagpole and through the cabinet room, the Prime Minister sitting at his or her desk—that view from one to the other—so that any leader of this nation is thinking of the sacrifice and service of those who put on uniforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As individuals and as a nation, we are grateful and we know we must do better to support our veterans. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs said, 'This is an important task and responsibility of government—a solemn commitment.' It's one we take very seriously. The extensive submission and consultation phase of the inquiry also highlighted the need to resolve critical systemic issues relating to the experiences of ADF veterans in accessing support through the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the interim publications of the royal commission is the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Shining </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Light</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Stories of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Trauma </span><span style="font-style:italic;">&amp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Tragedy, Hope </span><span style="font-style:italic;">&amp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Healing</span>. The book centres on the lived experience of hundreds of ADF members and veterans. It was tabled in parliament on 20 June this year. The book focuses on the experience of ADF members and veterans, in joining up, serving, the impact of leadership, mental health struggles, the transition to civilian life, the effect on their families and dealing with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, amongst other topics. It is a confronting but eye-opening and important book and one that we should all read.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot of work to do in improving the experiences of veterans. The Albanese Labor government is starting with addressing the first recommendation of the royal commission's interim report from way back in August 2022—that is, to simply harmonise veteran compensation and rehabilitation legislation via this bill. The Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill will improve veterans' experiences in dealing with the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans engage with the Department of Veterans' Affairs for numerous reasons. For many, it is because of physical injuries or mental health deterioration suffered in training or in the line of duty. For others, it is for assistance with vocational rehabilitation or income support. It is a vital service and one that reflects the gratitude of the nation for their service. However, the interim report noted that the veterans' entitlements system, as it currently works, is detrimental to the mental health of some veterans and their families. The cure is actually the start of the disease for many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons for this is that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is currently governed by three different but overlapping pieces of legislation. These are the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, or VEA, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988, or the DRCA, and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, or the MRCA. The interim report makes it clear that the complexity of the three pieces of legislation makes it very difficult for veterans to navigate the compensation system. It also makes it very challenging for departmental staff to administer. This complexity has led to processing delays, inconsistency in claim assessments and outcomes, and backlogs in claims. The report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The three main Acts operate in different ways and the entitlements available to a veteran will depend on many circumstances and factors, including when an injury occurred, and the type of service being undertaken at the time of injury. The Acts provide different types of compensation, including pensions, lump sums and periodic compensation payments, health care and rehabilitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Entitlements are offset when a veteran has entitlements under more than one Act or receives a pension or lump sum under a superannuation scheme. There are also different procedures available when a veteran wants to challenge an adverse decision, depending on what the decision is, and under which Act it was made. For example, the Veterans' Review Board can review decisions made under the VEA and MRCA but not under the DRCA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Shining a Light </span>describes the system as describes the system as a 'tangled legislative and bureaucratic web'. It's no wonder that many veterans need the assistance of advocates to help them lodge claims and support them through the assessment process. I've been an MP for a few years, not quite as many as some in this chamber. I've already done way too many sessions with constituents trying to sort out their entitlements from the Vietnam War. Gough Whitlam announced that our troops would be coming home on 5 December 1972, and we are still dealing with the ramifications. The red tape can be complicated and confusing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Army veteran, who received injuries during training, wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have been waiting just short of two years for DVA to accept my claims for a variety of conditions that include major depressive disorder, PTSD, general anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. Without my advocate, I have no doubt that I would never have been able to submit these claims successfully due to the bureaucratic nightmare that is the DVA. It is a system that almost none can navigate or understand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is obvious that changes and improvements to the system are vital. In fact, there are longstanding recommendations to simplify veterans' legislation. The bill is the most significant work on this issue since the introduction of the MRCA two decades ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the Productivity Commission report, <span style="font-style:italic;">A better way to support veterans, </span>recommended streaming the three acts into two. With this bill, however, the Labor government is taking the reforms one step further. The bill reduces veterans' entitlements legislation from three acts into one, the MRCA. It will simplify the claiming and assessment process and enable veterans to access the required supports more quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new legislation, the VEA and DRCA will work within the single act model, but will be closed to new applications for compensation and rehabilitation from 1 July 2026. Those receiving benefits under the VEA and DRCA will still do so under these grandparenting arrangements, giving veterans and families financial certainty. Veterans will also benefit from eight schedules of enhancements to the MRCA, which are designed to make access to entitlements easier and fairer. These changes have been informed by extensive feedback from the veteran community throughout 2023 and 2024 during the veterans' legislation reform consultation pathway. In short, the changes will make it easier for veterans and families to understand which entitlements they are eligible for and easier for veteran advocates to assist with claims. All of this adds up to a faster and more efficient processing of claims on the administrative side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the changes concerns compensation for funeral arrangements. Family members can lodge a claim under the MRCA even if the deceased member previously accessed entitlements under the VEA or DRCA. The funeral allowance will also increase from $2,000 to $3,000, and the reimbursement of funeral expenses for all service related deaths will be $14,062.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The MRCA will become the legislative basis for benefits such as the acute support package, household services and attendant care, the Victoria Cross allowance, and recognition supplements for former prisoners of war. The MRCA will also be responsible for the legislative basis for non-liability health care and the determination of special treatment programs and their eligibility. Elements of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, such as recognition for services including peacekeeping, operational and hazardous service and British nuclear testing, will be moved to the MRCA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget in May directed $222 million towards additional funding for veteran and family entitlements. This bill introduces a new payment, the additional disablement amount. This will provide eligible veterans—those who are over the pension age and who have significant service related impairment—with access to the gold card, and additional benefits in the event of the veteran's death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important to Labor that no veteran is worse off or receives lower benefits than they're currently receiving—those that have successfully steered their way through the red tape—and this bill guarantees that. The changes will begin on 1 July 2026, allowing time for the community, both veterans and advocacy groups, to thoroughly understand the changes. Up until this time, veterans will be able to lodge claims under the three acts or they can choose to delay their claims until the enhanced MRCA comes into effect. It is up to them; it's their choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">RSL Australia and a comprehensive range of defence community and advocacy groups have welcomed this bill. Labor stands behind the wonderful veteran community. We've hired an additional 500 permanent staff in the Department of Veterans' Affairs to action the claims backlog that we inherited. This will see $6.5 billion of delayed entitlements go to veterans over five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to leave my final words in this speech to Mr Hugh Polson, president of the Sunnybank RSL Sub-Branch in my electorate. Hugh is a tireless advocate for veterans and our community. He's one of the best RSL presidents in the land. I'm happy to put that on the record. Hugh has been through the DVA entitlements system as an applicant and as an advocate. For more than a decade Hugh ran the pensions advocacy and welfare service at RSL Queensland. Like others, Hugh describes the current system as 'really tricky to navigate', saying that 'veterans generally would be much more comfortable trying to navigate one form of legislation'. The reforms in this bill will reduce the anxiety and distress that veterans have experienced in dealing with complex and overlapping legislation in order to claim their entitlements. Having the solid foundation of one act will ensure that veterans are treated equitably and meet Hugh's wish for legislation: that it 'succeeds as a one-stop shop' for veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say, 'Thank you for your service,' to Hugh and all the people that he represents and to the other RSLs in my area and all throughout Australia, obviously. I commend this important bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  Much of what the member for Moreton just spoke about I agree with, but I will clinically go through the legislation and some of the points he raised in relation to the Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024. This is, as the member for Moreton correctly pointed out, important legislation, and it comes as a result of the findings from the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, which, in August 2022, warned that legislation governing compensation and rehabilitation for veterans and their families was 'so complicated that it adversely affects the mental health of some veterans' and 'can be a contributing factor to suicidality'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing that we want to do is place any more stress or anxiety on our veterans. They did, after all, do what was expected of them, what was asked of them and what was required of them, and that was to put on a uniform and serve our nation. For that, we owe them a huge debt of gratitude—a lifetime of gratitude. For as long as they live, we should not just be eternally thankful but do what's right for them in a financial way so that they can be their best selves—noting that every person who leaves the Australian defence forces is not broken. Every ex-ADF member still has much to give. Some of them come out of their service in different shapes and forms than others. Some are, quite tragically, very much affected by their experience—by what they have seen and what has been done to them. But many are ready for their next journey in life, the next chapter in life's journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill intends to act as a single, all-encompassing piece of legislation under which all veteran compensation claims will be dealt with, regardless of when the veteran served, and that is important too. I note the member for Moreton talked about Vietnam veterans. I come from Wagga Wagga. It's the home of the soldier. The 1st Recruit Training Battalion Kapooka Army base, Blamey Barracks, is where every recruit does their initial training, and we thank them for that. Not only do we have a very important strategic Army base; we also have the Royal Australian Air Force base at Forest Hill, where it states quite clearly on one of the hangars which overlooks the initial runway there at the Wagga Wagga Airport: 'Airpower begins here.' And it does, right there at Forest Hill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conjunction with RAAF Wagga, we have a very important Navy base. We're a long way from the nearest drop of seawater at Wagga Wagga, but those 80 personnel who serve our Navy do it because they are asked to do it. They do it with every pride, with every service and with every commitment that you would expect. They are very pleased that they are learning what they need to at Wagga Wagga, in conjunction with the Air Force and, at times, with our local Army base. We are a tri-service garrison city, and we are very proud of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That service goes back, stretches back, for decades, and, given the fact the former coalition government, honoured by the now Labor government, are spending upwards of $1.4 billion at both the RAAF Wagga and Kapooka military base at Wagga Wagga, that service, commitment, dedication and presence will last not just for many more decades to come but forever. The price of peace is eternal vigilance, and the training begins at Wagga Wagga. So I'm very aware of the commitment that we need to make to our veterans. I'm very aware of the necessity to ensure that they are well looked after, and, indeed, the royal commission visited Wagga Wagga. It held a hearing over three days, from 28 November to 1 December 2022, at the Mercure Hotel in our city. It heard some harrowing evidence, I have to say. It truly did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that we have two very good centres looking after the needs and expectations of our veterans. I would place on the record the work being done by many, including so many volunteers at RSL LifeCare's Riverina Veteran and Family Hub on 240 Baylis Street, right on the main street of our town. We have not only the RSL but also Pro Patria Centre, a community based centre which is located at 19 Morshead Street, Ashmont.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, on 3 October, Charles Sturt University, which is also based at Wagga Wagga, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Pro Patria to bolster initiatives to enhance the quality of life of veterans, first responders and their families. The MOU supports recommendations within the final report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, handed down on 9 September. The landmark collaboration between CSU and Pro Patria represents a significant step forward, a giant leap, in addressing the critical health and wellbeing needs of contemporary veterans. I said at that landmark signing, and I say it here, that we do owe a debt of gratitude to the Carmelite sisters, the nuns, whose premise is in Ashmont where the Pro Patria Centre now stands and stands proudly to continue to serve our veterans, as they served us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The MOU focuses on initiatives to enhance veterans' quality of life, which is so very integral and vital. The MOU also speaks to the tragic numbers of deaths by suicide amongst members of the ADF, which were recently outlined within a report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The report outlined that there were 1,677 certified deaths by suicide of ADF members between 1997 and 2021—1,677. One would have been too many, yet there were 1,677, and it is an eternal shame for us as a nation to have that number of people who put on a uniform and who died so needlessly. They are missed by their families. You can imagine. We're only a few short weeks away from Christmas. At each of those 1,677 tables, this Christmas and every other Christmas to come, there will be an empty chair, and that is so heartbreaking. That is why the royal commission was such an important gathering of people from all over the nation to come and tell their stories, but, more importantly, for this place to listen and to act—and act we must.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this legislation for what it does, but, in saying that, I note there has been some criticism. I will raise those criticisms in a short while. But, just getting back to the MOU between CSU and Pro Patria, it aims to collaborate on the following:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think it's important to acknowledge Colonel Stone, the commandant at Kapooka. What he has done at that facility is to continue the efforts that previous commandants have gone to. Being the commander of the Kapooka base, I think, is the most important position in Army and, indeed, in the ADF, because the trust and responsibility that is bestowed upon them is so very significant. We thank Colonel Tim Stone for what he has done. I know he's moving on from his post, but I wish him every success, and I'm pleased to say he's going to continue in the recruiting space.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some criticism of certain elements of this bill. It would be remiss of me not to point out that RSL Australia has said that the various provisions in the bill do not adequately refer to 'veterans' but merely to 'persons who have served'. These are their words, not mine:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The RSL expresses its concern that the proposed legislation enabling members and former members of the ADF to access DVA benefits identified the necessary qualifications of various categories of 'persons' who have served in the ADF. It makes no mention of 'veterans'. The view of the RSL is that the word 'veteran' should be visible and should be inclusive, as identified in the definition in Section 4 of the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and their Families First) Act 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that, being a former veterans' affairs minister. I get that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legacy Australia said it lacks a clause to enable data exchange with Centrelink to avoid overpayments—we don't want to see that—and then provisions going to getting those remittances repaid. Further, Legacy suggests that this opportunity for major reform should be fully embraced with other changes, including that veterans should be reimbursed for medical evidence costs. They talk about inadequate DVA medical fees. Legacy regularly hears from its clubs of the difficulty that families of veterans have in accessing medical treatment, including for mental health, due to the medical practitioners not being prepared to provide medical services at the rates paid by the DVA. These rates need to be reviewed and at least raised to those paid by the NDIS. There is probably no argument there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association mentioned that the legislation, in its view, was too complex and not enough reform. While the association supports the government's aim of simplifying the administrative arrangements for providing support arrangements for defence personnel, veterans and their families, they believe that the proposed legislation remains too complex. It also excludes whole classes of veterans and has not been drafted to reflect the nature of current and future operations. That's what the association said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When finalising this, the ALP needs to take those constructive criticisms into account because, as the member for Moreton quite correctly pointed out, we owe our veterans no less. He mentioned the fact that the very front doors of the—newly refurbished, I'm proud to say—Australian War Memorial lead right along Anzac Parade, right through the front doors of the parliament, right through the cabinet table and right through to the Prime Minister's desk. That is not just symbolic; that is necessary. Every leader of this nation understands how important our veterans are. Every member of this place should do everything they can as members to help constituents. I'm proud to say that I have a fine veteran community in the Riverina. I'll just finally say a big thank you to Bob and Gladys Bak of Bethungra, who do more than many to help our veterans, as they should and as we should.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  Today I rise proudly to support the Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024. Our government, the Albanese government, is committed to delivering a better future for defence personnel, veterans and their families by ensuring that they can access the services and the support they need and, quite frankly, are entitled to and deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has worked tirelessly to improve the system for veterans to tackle the key issues that harm the very people who have served this nation. We have delivered on our election commitment to address veteran homelessness with our Veterans Acute Housing Program, which delivered $30 million to support veterans and their families who experience or are at risk of homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have reduced the time of veterans' claims. In fact, we cleared the backlog that, as stated in the royal commission, would never ever be cleared up under the LNP, and we did that one month before the royal commission's recommendation. At its worst, the coalition let claims take up to 435 days and had 60,000 unallocated cases. That is a national shame. We recognise that, though our improvement is vast compared to the previous government, it still hasn't been enough. That's why we've promised more support in our last budget, investing a further $186 million towards the employment of new staff to ensure that those backlogs don't re-emerge and to make claims processing even faster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is also investing an additional $477 million in this year's budget to increase our support to the more than 340,000 veterans and dependants accessing services through DVA. All of this is alongside our work implementing the recommendations from the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, where we have committed an additional $220 million to deliver the first recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government promised to act on the state of veterans affairs, and that is exactly what we are doing. The legislation before us today is one of the many steps forward this government is taking for veterans communities. It will benefit current and former defence personnel and their families for generations to come. The amendment's main purpose is what it says on the packet: to simplify and harmonise Australian veterans' rehabilitation and compensation system. The legislation is in response to the first recommendation of the royal commission to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those listening would know that veterans entitlements are determined under one or more of three primary compensation acts depending on where the veteran served. It also depends on which period of service caused or contributed to the condition being claimed. The legislation effectively streamlines the number of acts administered by DVA to significantly simplify claims processing, giving veterans and families the support they need faster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, claims from 1 July 2026 will be dealt with under one single piece of legislation, an improved Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act—or MRCA, as it's commonly known—regardless of when or where the veteran served. The bill also introduces a range of enhancements to MRCA that will make access to entitlements easier and fairer for veterans. These enhancements have been the subject of extensive consultation with the veteran community throughout 2023 and 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To cut through the bureaucratese, the important principles of the legislation are to increase the funeral compensation cap, to cut through the red tape that delays payments to veterans and their families, to make it simpler to claim medical care for veterans and to provide a new payment for veterans over the pension age who suffered substantial injuries during service. All these changes place less burden on veterans and provide greater support sooner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans and their families should know that these changes will not result in a reduction in any individual veteran's payment. Let's be very clear about that. Compensation under the existing framework will still be awarded under the current agreements and won't be disrupted. Additionally, it will allow the community to take time to adjust, and they will be well-informed of the changes. A commencement date has been set for 1 July 2026. This will allow veterans to consider their individual circumstances and their families to adjust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The date also ensures that advocates for the veteran community and DVA staff have adequate training to enact these changes. The question is: why is it needed? The changes outlined here are desperately needed. The system, as it stands, is overly complex and difficult to understand. The Albanese Labor government is implementing these changes to lessen the burden placed on our ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen, fixing the system so it can actually provide veterans with the support they need. Importantly, it won't leave them in limbo waiting for their rightful compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The calls for ex-defence personnel to fix the complex system have been going on for a long time, and this bill makes the most significant commitment to reform veterans legislation in over 20 years. For too long, the mantra that veterans had while accessing government services was, 'Delay, deny and die.' That's a horrible thought. This legislation is part of the Albanese Labor government's determination to change the LNP legacy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to delivering a better future for defence personnel, veterans and families, and the impact of that is not only across the country but at home too. These changes and a suite of measures outlined in the 2024 budget will deliver for just shy of 3,000 veterans and their families in our communities. I have been talking to local veterans at every single RSL over the last few weeks to see what the feeling is amongst them. I have to say: there is a lot of support. It means a system funded better than it has ever been for three decades, and that can only have a positive impact. Even those staunchest conservatives acknowledge that it's the Labor government that has fixed up the mess that veterans have suffered with for decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes that the Labor government is implementing come from longstanding calls within the veteran community. When we came to government, the veterans portfolio was in an absolute crisis. The legacy left behind by the LNP was a national shame. For a coalition that parades itself around as being strong in defence, they, frankly, did a pretty poor job—delay, deny, die. That came about due to the Morrison-Dutton government in action on a portfolio that was spiralling out of control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wait times meant too many veterans and their families were suffering without attention. Wait times meant too many veterans didn't end up getting the entitlements owed to them. Even members of the coalition knew the shame of this legacy, with no less a person than the last Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the coalition government, the member for Calare, threatening to resign if more money weren't allocated to the portfolio and the 60,000 unprocessed claims weren't addressed. Delay, deny, die—this is the legacy that the Albanese Labor government inherited and that we have worked tirelessly to change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs injected the funding and the resources that the portfolio has desperately needed for a decade. Through his tireless work, our government has been providing unprecedented support for veterans across our country. The budget that the Albanese Labor government brought forward in May this year reflected these goals and values. With the changes to the legislation we are here speaking on today and the increase to payments and support services that we put up in the budget, this government is standing up for the veterans in our community. We're not talking about it; we're actually doing it. We build. They block. This is something Australians should be holding this government and future governments accountable for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a responsibility to support all Australians, but there is a particular onus on government to stand up for veterans. As Shane Wright from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> articulated, on page 97 of the budget there is a paragraph that 'demands to be read and understood by all Australians'. When we talk about a fair budget, this is a prime example. The Albanese government, in providing the support to veterans, have turned the tide. We are committed to leaving a legacy that will protect veterans for years to come. We are preparing our public systems and processes for the $6.5 billion going to veterans' support over the next five years—$6.5 billion. This is because of the massive increases we've seen in claims being processed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When those opposite talk about cutting government spending, this is the sort of thing that they don't like us spending on. They complain about it. We do this because it results in increased payments for veterans. It's pretty straightforward. Those opposite failed to put money in the pockets of veterans and provide the resources to make sure veterans can have the best quality of life post service. They failed to do their job properly, so here, as in so many other portfolios, we are picking up the pieces. They failed to give the Public Service adequate tools and other necessities to do its job in helping veterans. And do you know what we got as the substantial idea from the coalition in their budget reply speech? That they're going to introduce cuts to public services—the so-called cardigan wearers. This is the shame that is the current opposition in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Shane Wright article talks about what we're doing. Scott Morrison, when he was Prime Minister, said, 'Oh, I understand the battles that so many veterans face when they leave the Defence Force,' and he argued that this nation should do more for the men and women in uniform. But do you know what? When it came to the crunch, he went missing. The article goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By April 2023, the average processing time for a veteran's claim was 435 days …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Opposition Leader Peter Dutton complained … that the number of public servants has swelled under the Albanese government, declaring the Coalition sees defence spending as "much more of a priority than office staff in Canberra".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They also see it as much more important than serving and helping the veterans who have served this nation. It's a pretty damning indictment of the views of the Leader of the Opposition if he thinks that the people who are helping the veterans get their payments and entitlements are not worthy. It shows that you can wrap yourself in your flag and stand there and pretend you're great for veterans but, when it comes to the crunch, there's only one side of the House that's actually standing up for veterans, and that is us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this from Andrew Gee, the member for Calare, who talked about what happened when he was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Read his press conference transcript from 29 May 2024 at 8.41 am. This is something all of those opposite should read to realise just how badly they treated veterans for nine years. The member for Calare said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I … threatened to resign because there was not enough money to clear up these … veterans' compensation claims, which are having an appalling effect on the physical and mental wellbeing of our veterans. And the reason that I was given as to why there was no funding was because at the time, the government was only prioritising funding that had a political advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll read that bit again: 'only prioritising funding that had a political advantage'. So, because they didn't feel there was a political advantage in funding veterans' issues and clearing up the compensation, they wouldn't fund it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To his credit, the member for Calare ended up resigning, and I think it was the right thing to do. There are many on that side that should sit down and think, 'Is that really what you did for nine years?' They were undermining the work of the Public Service, and now they want to walk these reforms back. The coalition has outlined what they were going to do, and it's disgraceful, and I wish they'd look beyond culture wars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ALP will always stand up for those who have served or are serving in our Defence Force. Our legislation before us today is one of the many levers we are pulling to reduce the burden and pressure, responding to the needs and wishes of the community to make sure access is available and support is there. That's why legislation like this must come into the parliament and must have a speedy pick-up. People opposite shouldn't be sitting there trying to hold it up and create another form of blocking and bureaucracy that doesn't need to happen. As we come to 11 November, everyone is going to be out at services for Remembrance Day. The question is: what will you have done by then? Will the bill have gone through? Will you support the changes that we've made and that we have continued to make? Or will you continue on with the age-old LNP mantra of 'delay, deny and die'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As George Rosier from Carlingford wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, the LNP attitude is summed up perfectly as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… "Jackmanship", the attitude that "I'm all right Jack, and I don't care about anyone else". It was unacceptable in the Army 55 years ago, and it is unacceptable in politics now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This callous treatment of the ADF veterans, added to a robodebt disaster, really demonstrates how much the coalition has failed veterans in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is so important as one of the major steps going forward to address the 10 years of neglect under those opposite, who were happy to let veterans go homeless and without getting the compensation and the medical help that they deserved. It is only the Albanese Labor government who has taken the commitment and delivered on that, and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs should be congratulated for getting this done.</span>

Those 103,000 names are from every corner of this country, and they are from every background, many not born here. They were people whose politics we didn't know and we shouldn't know, because it's irrelevant. So to speak on this topic and to hear the member for McEwen engaged in the most partisan speech was really disappointing and beneath him and beneath this place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take you back to an event that happened in my electorate recently. It was an event to acknowledge Vietnam Veterans' Day, which used to be called Long Tan Day. Gathered there were so many Vietnam veterans from my electorate. Amongst them was one that I knew, because his son sits in this place over on that side: the member for Solomon. In that address, I singled him out because I wanted to make the point that service is above politics and beyond politics. Those who put on our uniform are patriots, no matter who they vote for, whether they're a socialist or way to the right. It doesn't matter. They're a patriot either way. They risked their life for a better tomorrow. To clarify, the member for Solomon's not a socialist—I just want to be very clear about that! He's not a socialist. But it is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at the numbers, because that wall that you can walk down the memorial to isn't just a piece of public architecture. It's an acknowledgement of the sacrifice and service that has come before us. One hundred and three thousand names sounds like a lot, and human brains aren't very good at thinking of large numbers. There are some Victorians in this place and we're thinking of our fellow citizens, who are deservedly having a long weekend back in Victoria. But, when we think of large numbers in Victoria, we think of that other great icon in our state, the MCG. One hundred and three thousand names is a full MCG with veterans spilling over onto the place where we actually play football. That's how many Australians died for this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, we have an almost full MCG of full-time Defence Force members, just under 90,000. That includes almost 20,000 members of the Navy, almost 50,000 members of the Army and just over 20,000 members of the Air Force. More than 6,000 Australians enlist in the ADF on average every year. I mention those numbers in speaking on this bill because, when parents are thinking of where their children might go and if they might serve our nation, they want to know that we will care for them on the other side. It is part of the contract that we have with those who serve. If you seek to sacrifice your life, all of your tomorrows, for us, the very least we can do is to look after you on the other side. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the title of this bill says 'veterans' entitlements, treatment and support simplification and harmonisation'. That is an important attribute of the rule of law. If you go to the Law Council's webpage they have a document on how to promote the rule of law and the very first principle they have is that the law must be known, it must be available, it must be certain and it must be clear. For too long, for veterans to seek the support that they needed, they needed to engage someone who not just was qualified as a lawyer but knew every in and out of this process. In fact, Vietnam veterans found it so hard that they developed a system where they became advocates. Advocates, you might think, are paid and get a cut of the benefit. But they are not paid. They are volunteers. They were people who recognised that the system was so complex that other veterans needed help. I am a qualified lawyer, I was admitted as a barrister and practised for 10 years. But, when I looked at the old act, I didn't understand it. It was so complex that I wouldn't know where to fill in the form. So I spoke to other veterans that I'd served with who had gone through the process, and each of them said they could not have done it without an advocate. That was a broken system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the royal commission into veteran suicide had as its first recommendation to simplify and harmonise veteran compensation and rehabilitation legislation. The law should be simple, clear, available and easily understood. You should not have to engage an advocate. You certainly should not have to engage a lawyer. So it is important that this reform happens, and I commend the government for bringing it forward. I wish they'd brought it forward a year earlier, but here we are. It has been brought forward now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, there are three acts. We know from various speakers before me what they are. Depending upon when your service was or when your injury occurred, you are covered by one or more of those acts. I have on many other occasions held up the pages of bills and acts in this place, from the Fair Work Act to the Corporations Act and the tax act, and they are complex enough. But, when you look at the veteran scheme, it came to over 2,000 pages, with more than 850 legislative instruments. That is an unworkable system on any definition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend that system, and it will close the loop for those who were in a period of uncertainty—they didn't know which act they were covered by. Then, if they filled in the form, assuming they were covered by one and not the other, it delayed the time in which they got compensated or the treatment that they desperately needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes a range of enhancements for various entitlements. I do want to list some of these, because veterans do watch question time and they sometimes watch speeches like this. So they include the introduction of a new—</span>

                    </a>  I will take the interjection. They include the introduction of a new additional disablement amount. They include the introduction of presumptive liability. For those who don't understand what presumptive liability means, it means that the Commonwealth assumes responsibility. If you are a veteran and you have been injured, you don't have to prove that that was because of the service that you had. It consolidates household and attendant care. It has an increase of $3,000 for the funeral allowance and the availability of reimbursements of funeral expenses up to $14,000 for all service related deaths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want that to be widely known. Too often veterans will pass away and not only did they not tell enough of their stories and their service to their family but they didn't tell their families that this benefit was available. So I think it's important that families of veterans know that. There will be a higher reimbursement amount for travel when a private vehicle is used to travel for treatment. We heard many stories of veterans being out of pocket just to drive to the place where they needed care. There will be the standardisation of allowances and other payments and the introduction of an instrument enabling the Repatriation Commission to determine circumstances where a veteran must receive financial advice before receiving a lump sum payment. And that is important. Not every veteran is in a position where the influx of a payment will necessarily make their life better without advice. That is an important change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke at the start about an MCG full of Australians who died serving this nation. We have six MCGs full of veterans in this country who are alive now and deserve and need our care. This bill will go a long way to making that process simpler and fairer and to giving people the comfort to know that this next phase of their life will be a little easier and, more than that, that a nation recognises the sacrifice that they have made and supports them in every way that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just came from a meeting with a group. There are many groups that support veterans, but this one focuses particularly on families. Veterans care for their families probably as much as they do for their country, and it is important that we also care for veterans' families. Often they fall through the gap, and they're left to pick up the pieces. I think that, as a veteran myself, there would be no greater gift to know that, whenever I'm no longer on this earth, someone else is caring for the people that I left behind—because that's what makes you get up every day and that's what makes you think of a better tomorrow for our country. I commend the government. This is above politics, because, to anyone who puts on the uniform, you are a patriot no matter which side of the chamber you sit on.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  World War I marked Australia in a way that is almost impossible to fathom in current times—to think that, from a population of less than five million, we raised an army of more than 400,000, of which some 330,000 were deployed overseas. By war's end, over 60,000 had been killed, 5,565 in my own home state of South Australia—put differently, nearly one in five of those deployed overseas. Compared to Australia's modern-day population, that would roughly equate to 250,000 Australians being killed in a world war. Can you imagine the impact this would have on families and communities all over the nation, just as it did back then?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1917, the Australian government created the Repatriation Department to help returned veterans resettle in the Australian community. The department introduced programs to assist veterans to develop their vocational skills and find jobs, and it supported their independence through pensions and different schemes, loans et cetera. The soldier settlement scheme was established, and it was administered by the states. As we know, Australian women and men who served in the Australian Defence Force over the next 100 years have quite rightly continued to be supported by the Australian government. This system, as we all know, is governed by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, and their various legislative instruments, which provide different types of entitlements and support to eligible veterans and their dependants.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide made the following observations in its interim report, published on 11 August 2022:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current compensation and rehabilitation system is the product of continuous historical legislative reform involving numerous Acts. Reform to the various veteran entitlement Acts over the last century has often been piecemeal. This has resulted in the continuation of various older entitlements alongside new entitlements, thereby building a multi-layered system. Increasing complexity was the by-product but never the purpose of such reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioners outlined how urgent reform to this complex system of legislation was, and again I will quote them:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's veteran compensation and rehabilitation legislative system is so complicated that it adversely affects the mental health of some veterans—serving and ex-serving Australian Defence Force (ADF) members—and can be a contributing factor to suicidality. The Australian Government has known for years that the system requires fundamental reform. Yet it has not acted with speed. There is no justification for further delay. The Australian Government should urgently implement legislative reforms to simplify and harmonise the veteran entitlement system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, this legislative reform was the first recommendation of the commissioners: Mr Nick Kaldas APM, the Hon. James Douglas QC and Dr Peggy Brown AO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be speaking on this bill, and I sincerely hope that the reforms it contains to simplify and harmonise the veteran entitlements system will save the lives of women and men who have worn our nation's uniform. The rate of veteran suicide is a national tragedy, and that's why Labor, in opposition, supported the establishment of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide in opposition. Some three years and thousands of submissions later, the final report has now been delivered to the government. I'd like to thank two of my constituents in particular—Julie-Ann Finney and Angela McKay, who have both lost sons—for their tireless advocacy on behalf of the veterans who have died by suicide and their families and friends. The work and advocacy those two women have done is just incredible. Many of you would know them. They have been up here many times, especially Julie-Ann Finney.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report is an important body of work which marks the culmination of the most significant and comprehensive inquiry conducted into suicide in the defence and veteran communities. The report is very comprehensive—some 122 recommendations and seven volumes. I know Minister Keogh and his department are working through all of that as soon as practicable, because we do understand the urgency. So many others across the veteran community and families have expressed to me and to all of us that we need to act quickly on these recommendations, and I know the government is working its way through them as quickly as it can so we can produce a government response before the end of the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government agrees with the need for an oversight body, as recommended by the royal commission. The details, of course, will be considered in the context of the full government response. And I'd like to publicly thank the commissioners for their outstanding work conducting a thorough and compassionate inquiry. I've no doubt that this bill will be one of many positive outcomes that will come as a direct result of their substantial and important work.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2022, Minister Keogh, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, announced the first of three consultation periods and called for public submissions. Feedback from the veteran community overwhelmingly supported the need to simplify and harmonise veterans' compensation legislation. This informed and proposed the pathway to simplify veterans' compensation and rehabilitation legislation. The proposed pathway featured establishing an improved MRCA as the sole ongoing scheme, closing out the VEA and the DRCA to new compensation related claims, and grandparenting all existing arrangements to ensure there is no reduction in entitlements currently or previously received by veterans. In February 2023, we began the public consultation on this proposed pathway, which resulted in the exposure draft of the Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024. Significant consultation was undertaken on this bill in 2024 to make sure that we get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before the parliament does not save the government money. Indeed, the May budget set aside an additional $222 million for veteran and family entitlements across the first two years of operation. I know these public consultations have been keenly followed by veterans and their families, ex-service organisations and necessary service providers to the veteran community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time in census history, the 2021 census collected data on military service, which has given us greater visibility of where those currently serving live, whereas previously we were only aware of the suburbs where veterans who had already submitted a DVA claim resided. So now we can tell where they live, whereas previously we couldn't. On census night in the federal electorate of Adelaide, my own electorate, there were 3,843 residents, 2.3 per cent of the population of my electorate, who responded that they have previously served or are currently serving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of these residents and their families are represented at regular gatherings of a very fine group of South Australian ex-service organisations who made submissions to the consultation process. The Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024 was the topic of discussion that my last Adelaide Veterans Forum, which I hosted and which included representatives of the RSL South Australia State branch, the Legacy Club of South Australia and Broken Hill, RSL LifeCare, the Vietnam Veterans Association, the Vietnam Veterans' Federation, the Australian War Widows South Australia, the Partners of Veterans Association, the Veterans Wellbeing Centre, the Air Force Association of South Australia, the Far East Strategic Reserve association, the Royal Australian Regiment Association, and representatives of the Kilburn, Unley, Prospect, Hilton, West Croydon and Kilkenny, and Walkerville RSL subbranches, who all do a magnificent job supporting veterans in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Naturally, not every veteran and ex-service organisation is in support of every single aspect of this bill. But it's fair to say that the harmonisation of the complex legislative framework has been well received, especially by those groups that I just spoke about and veterans in my electorate. This was the conclusion of the South Australian consortium of ex-service organisations of Australia, who provided a submission on behalf of 18 ex-service and kindred organisations, who were 'broadly supportive' of what has been proposed. I'll take a quick minute to congratulate this group, whose membership organisations have lobbied for legislative harmonisation for many, many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this bill will make it easier for veterans and their families to know what they are entitled to, make it easier for veteran claim advocates to assist veterans and families with these claims and make it quicker for DVA to process claims so veterans and their families will be able to get the benefits that they need and deserve in a timely fashion. In addition to these improvements to services for veterans and families in this bill, we've been delivering for veterans in other ways as well. The government's eliminated the veteran compensation claims backlog caused by the previous government's underfunding and underresourcing of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There was a backlog of some 42,000 veteran compensation claims when we came into government. That has now been cleared, ahead of the deadline set by the Royal Commission into Defence and Veterans Suicide. Now veterans' claims are with someone for review within 14 days. I know that there's further work being done to speed up the time to process the claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After nearly a decade of underfunding and underresourcing, today the DVA is the best funded it's been in three decades, and this government is funding more than 640 additional permanent ongoing staff to get through the backlog and improve service delivery. That's what happens when you have a backlog and you want to get through that service delivery: you employ more people. That's exactly what this government has done—640 additional permanent ongoing staff. We've also delivered on our $24 million Veteran Employment Program to translate veterans skills to the civilian workforce and encourage businesses to both employ and support veterans in civilian workplaces. We've tripled the payment GPs receive in servicing veterans to ensure veterans can keep accessing the care they need. As part of the Housing Australia Future Fund, the government's investing $30 million in housing and wraparound services specifically designed for veterans at risk of or experiencing homelessness. We've also invested $46.2 million to expand access to the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme, giving eligible Defence personnel and veterans an easier pathway to homeownership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've implemented the Defence Veterans' and Families' Acute Support Package to provide crisis support to veteran families, including grand-carer families, when they need it. We released the nation's first Veteran Transition Strategy to better support Defence personnel in their transition to civilian life. We've also taken action on all recommendations from the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide's interim report. We're delivering 10 additional veterans' and families' hubs in areas of high veteran populations. These are a one stop shop for the veteran communities to access services and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is absolutely committed to working to ensure that our community provides our newest veterans and their families with the support they require to make the physical and emotional transition to civilian life. It is my hope that they will enjoy the benefits of what they and previous generations of Australian Defence Force personnel have fought and died to preserve. This bill is a much needed update to the work our predecessors started more than 100 years ago to support our returned veterans. This is the very least we can do, and I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Keogh, for his hard work on behalf of those who have worn our nations uniform and their families.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  We've recently heard really harrowing truths from the Royal Commission into Defence and Veterans Suicide. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has become a bureaucratic machine, crushing the people it should be helping. The royal commission confirmed what so many veterans already know—the DVA simply doesn't have the capacity or the will to look after the people it's supposed to serve. This failing system is actually costing lives, and that failure looks like this. Over the past 10 years, an average of 78 serving or ex-serving ADF members have died by suicide each year. That's three lives lost every fortnight. That's three families broken every two weeks. These aren't just statistics. These are Australians who sacrificed everything, only to be abandoned when they came home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission has laid it out in black and white. Defence incompetence is directly contributing to veteran suicides—because what happens when they turn to the DVA for help? Instead of the support they deserve, they get delay and they get denial, and they are forced to navigate a system that seems more interested in cost cutting than in human lives. Often they are left to feel like they are fighting a new war—one against the department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has billions for defence spending on weapons and submarines but spends a pittance on the very people who give their service to our country, often at incredible personal cost. I know this because I've seen it in my own electorate of Ryan, home to the Army barracks at Enoggera. People come to my office at their wits' end, completely broken by a system that cares more about saving a few bucks than saving lives. They've been left waiting months, sometimes years, for their claims to be processed. The DVA has itself admitted to a severe backlog in its systems. While they wait, their mental and physical health falls apart. Veterans are twice as likely to experience anxiety, depression and PTSD compared to the general population. Getting help through Defence is an ordeal in itself. It's a vicious cycle. People need help but can't access it, and the systems that are supposed to be there for them are actually pushing them closer to the edge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't new. The royal commission report is just the latest in a long line of investigations. We've had 57 inquiries over the past three decades, with 770 recommendations. How much has changed? Almost nothing. Time and again, Defence has fought tooth and nail to squash real reform. They've protected their own interests while veterans continue to fall through the cracks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just look at the culture within Defence. The royal commission revealed a toxic code of silence and rigid military values that are contributing directly to the suicide risk faced by ADF members. It's a broken culture, plain and simple, and the leadership of the ADF must be held accountable. This is not just about individual failures; this is systemic. The Prime Minister had the nerve to stand up and say, 'Just as our veterans and defence personnel step up for our country, we have an obligation to step up for them.' Well, it's about time the government started acting on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one indispensable recommendation from the royal commission is crystal clear. We need a standalone statutory entity to oversee and drive the reform that's long overdue. Without this, nothing will change. We need to clear the backlog of claims, ensure automatic approvals for delays and reform the way Defence handles mental health. Veterans deserve immediate streamlined access to mental health care without having to relive their trauma over and over again just to prove they need help. This isn't just bureaucratic incompetence; it's cruelty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Harmonising the three acts covering veterans entitlements is the first step, but it's not enough. Veterans shouldn't have to navigate complicated, outdated systems to access what they are owed, and the idea that combining these acts will fix these protracted issues is almost laughable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will reserve their position on this bill in the Senate to pursue amendments that will bring veterans and families comfort that they will be heard and not made worse.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  I rise today to support legislation that is long, long overdue, not by months but by a matter of years—the Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024. This legislation helps to match actions with the words that we as a government, as a parliament and as a nation use to convey our collective respect toward our veterans for their service, their duty and the sacrifices they've made and continue to make for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents not just a generational policy reform across this area of law. It also represents a significant moment in the Albanese Labor government's ongoing efforts to honour that solemn commitment—a commitment to ensure that every veteran receives the support that they deserve. These are commitments that they and anyone else in their position would expect their government to honour upon the completion of their service, and they should expect nothing less. They expect to receive this support without the burden of navigating through a broken labyrinthine system, one full of confusion, duplication and needless complication that often, in turn, causes needless distress upon the veteran community, a community this framework was supposedly designed to support. One could certainly forgive many veterans in our community for thinking that the sheer complexity of this system is a purposeful design feature rather than one of circumstance.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  It's an honour to present this evening two speeches written by young Capricornians Alexis and Kodi as part of the Raise Our Voice campaign. This year's question is: what do you want your community to look like in the next 10 years, and what can the next parliament do to achieve it? These are their thought-provoking responses, beginning with Kodi from Collinsville:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Imagine a community where voices can be heard and dreams can become a reality.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the next ten years, the Parliament has the chance to make this vision come to life for Collinsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My name is Kodi Mackie. A local who has lived in this town their entire life. Many people don't know about Collinsville. It's truly a hidden gem, home to approximately 1,500 people. However, it has very little facilities to offer and no major tourist attractions, besides the mines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So, you're probably wondering; how is this small town so special and different from the rest? Well, there is only two words to describe it, community spirit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Community is what keeps the town alive. In most places, people don't even know their own neighbours. But in Collinsville the town is your family, the people you rely on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Sadly, this spirit is starting to fade away, which is why we desperately need the parliament's help over the next decade to steer Collinsville in the right direction, so generations to come can keep the spirit alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The parliament must immediately focus on funding a variety of sporting teams to be introduced into the town. By offering locals a chance to train and represent their town together through different sports, it will increase the community wellbeing drastically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The town also needs to be provided with more opportunities for people to be able to express themselves and bond with others. This can be achieved by operating local workshops multiple times a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the parliament needs to allow the town to be heard. I want our community to look strong, powerful and to come together as one.</span>

Their ideas reflect the hopes and challenges faced by regional areas like Collinsville and Rockhampton.

                  <a href="299145" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BYRNES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  The Illawarra is a vibrant multicultural region, enriched by the diverse range of people from many different cultures. Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of attending several significant cultural events that showcase our diversity. The Teej festival, the Onam festival, the Taj Mahal dinner and Diwali celebrations are just a few of the cultural celebrations that unite many people in the Illawarra. During the festival of Teej, members of the Nepalese community came together to celebrate one of the most special occasions for Hindu women. The Teej festival is filled with song and dance to honour the goddess Parvati and her sacred union with Lord Shiva. The sea of beautiful red saris was not just a symbol of love and tradition but a powerful reminder of the resilience and strength of women. I would like to thank the Wollongong and Illawarra Nepali community for keeping such beautiful traditions alive and for having me there to celebrate with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another cherished tradition widely celebrated in the Illawarra is the Onam festival. Both the Illawarra Kerala Samajam and the Illawarra Malayalee Association hosted events for Onam, and I was fortunate enough to attend both. Onam is an annual harvest and cultural festival which is celebrated by the people of Kerala in southern India, which I was fortunate enough to visit a number of years ago. It is a special time when people come together regardless of their backgrounds to honour this rich tradition. Every aspect of the festivals, from the exquisite food to the lively performances and traditional music, embodies the essence of unity, happiness, prosperity and peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the pleasure of attending the Taj Mahal dinner, hosted by the Indian Australian Cultural Association of the Illawarra. It was a truly remarkable experience, highlighting the vibrant sights, sounds and flavours of India. This event not only showcased rich cultural heritage but also supported incredible causes close to the hearts of many in Wollongong. The Taj Mahal dinner, held every two years, has achieved remarkable success in raising money for the Disability Trust. Since 2013, with the support of generous businesses and individuals, the dinner has raised over $550,000. The funds not only support the Disability Trust but also benefit several important causes, like the TIGS Sony Camp, the TIGS Foundation and the Illawarra Passionate Cricketers Club. The Disability Trust just recently celebrated their 50th anniversary, where the member for Whitlam and I presented them with a certificate signed by the Prime Minister for the outstanding work that they do in caring for the vulnerable people in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These organisations will benefit greatly from the generosity of all who donated at the event, making a real difference in the lives of individuals in the Illawarra. This dinner was particularly special as it marked Dr Sharad Tamhane's sixth Taj Mahal dinner. He has dedicated countless hours over the years, supported by an incredible team, to make each event successful and enjoyable for all. Thank you to Dr Sharad Tamhane, Dr Lata Tamhane, Usha Fernandez and the team for putting on an incredible evening. It was an absolute delight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently, I had the honour of participating in the Diwali celebrations, the festival of lights, which is one of the most vibrant and significant Hindu festivals of the year. Diwali is a time to reflect on the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance. As the diyas are lit, we are reminded of our ability to bring warmth, light and positivity into the lives of those around us. Again, I would like to thank the Indian Australian Cultural Association of the Illawarra and Dr Sharad Tamhane for their hard work to put on such lovely events throughout the year. All of these cultural celebrations—the Teej festival, the Onam festival, the Taj Mahal dinner and Diwali—are examples of the vibrant diversity that enriches the Illawarra region. They not only honour the rich heritage of our diverse communities but also strengthen understanding and connections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Attending events like these, I am grateful that these organisations and their dedicated committees are able to showcase their culture within the wider Illawarra community. I would again like to thank you for the tireless work that you do to keep these beautiful traditions alive in our community. It is through these shared experiences that we build understanding, respect and unity among people not just in the Illawarra but all over Australia.</span>

This concerns the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Tougher Penalties for Supermarket and Hardware Businesses) Bill 2024 and, from the member for Maranoa, the Food and Grocery (Mandatory) Code of Conduct Bill 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaker, I know you would be an avid shopper at supermarkets and Bunnings. You look like a bit of a handy man. So you'll know how important it is when you go into these places—supermarkets, Bunnings and those types of organisations—for you to be getting the best deal and the cheapest prices that you can. In a previous life, I was in the investment world. Even back then, when I would speak to my international colleagues and people who were investing globally in the UK, Europe or the US, do you know what the term they used to give to Australia if they were investing in businesses here, in one of our leading companies? They used to call us 'Treasure Island'. You might say: 'Oh, that's good, Member for Page.' But, no, it was not good, because what they meant was it was a sure bet. If they were investing in one of our bigger businesses, such as—let's name names—Telstra, the banks, the supermarkets or one of our major airlines, why they said we were Treasure Island and a sure bet was because they viewed this country as having very little competition—that is, we are a country that is full of monopolies or duopolies within our major businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is about shaking it up a bit. This legislation isn't dealing with all of those categories of business. These two private member's motions are just dealing with the supermarkets and the Bunnings of the world at the moment. What it is about is that, if these companies are found to misuse or abuse their market power, they will get severe penalties. What is outrageous about that? I would have thought nothing. If they continue to do this type of thing, the threat is that they will have to divest of an asset. Does that sound outrageous to you? It is not outrageous to me. Do you know why it doesn't sound outrageous? It doesn't sound outrageous to you or any of us on this side of the parliament because this is not unique. The US has this type of legislation. The UK has this type of legislation. Most Western countries of similar ilk and liberal democracies like we are have this type of threat. It is not often used because the big companies go, 'We better be careful.' Woolworth doesn't want to have to sell off Big W. Qantas don't want to sell off anything. This is not about Qantas, but if it was applied to everyone they wouldn't want to have to sell off Jetstar or that type of asset. So what they do is they pull their heads in and they don't do some of the practices they are alleged to do now. So this is, we think, very reasonable legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaker, you know, I know and everyone in this country knows that at the moment cost of living is the issue from No. 1 to 10. What we on this side of the chamber firmly believe is that this type of policy will mean that we will get a more competitive sector in the supermarket industry and that prices will come down because of it. It's as simple as that. There are many examples of where supermarkets have been found to not do nice things and have been fined. The fines we have here now are not very big. I heard the Leader of the Nationals say today it was about $187,000. It's like going to the local supermarket and pulling out the till for that day and paying the fine. They don't care. The current penalties do not deter them from doing things that they shouldn't do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the alleged ones that is most popular is land banking. That is when you buy up all the land around a growing suburb or a growing area so that your competitors can't buy the land and put in a competitive asset or outlet to compete against you. That's on that side of things. On the other side of this is some of the alleged behaviour of the supermarkets to the farmers. We have just had an inquiry into this. It had to be confidential and really quite secretive because what the supermarkets are alleged to do if they find a supplier saying that there are things the supermarkets are doing that aren't okay is blacklist and black ban them so they are not able to supply to one of the duopoly. So this is commonsense legislation, and I encourage the government to support it.</span>

Abram, or Abe, was born in Lodz in Poland in 1924. He was only 15 years old when the Nazis invaded his home town and it became the Lodz ghetto. Abe, his parents and his three sisters were imprisoned in the ghetto along with around 200,000 others. They endured discrimination, starvation and terror. Only he and his sister survived. His parents, sisters and extended family were murdered in Auschwitz. Abe was only 20 years old when he was liberated by the American army.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the unimaginable trauma he faced as a teenager, his goal in life has been to fulfil a promise he made to his mother when they arrived at Auschwitz. She said to him, 'You should do everything humanly possible to survive, and, when you survive, you will tell people what actually happened.' That's exactly what Abe has dedicated his life to. Everyone who has met him has been touched by his story, and he has spent decades doing everything he can to make sure that the horrors of the past are never forgotten and that the lessons of history are remembered and are front of mind. He helped build a more multicultural, tolerant, wonderful and accepting Melbourne and Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a founding member of the Melbourne Holocaust Museum and has spoken to thousands and thousands of schoolchildren in Melbourne. Last month, I joined Abe, his children, Charlie and Helen, his grandchildren and 400 members of our community at the Glen Eira Town Hall to celebrate his 100th birthday. He had family members fly in from across the country and from overseas to join him. There were Yiddish songs with primary school students and performers, and he received a letter from the King and the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abe's story of survival, resilience and strength is known to everyone across our community, but it is also a story of love. He and his beautiful wife, Cesia, have been married for over 75 years. Despite all he went through, he chose to dedicate his life to making sure that everyone understands the dangers of hate when it is left unchecked. Abram, happy birthday, my friend. Biz hundert un tsvantsik—may there be many more years to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend we had a fantastic announcement that I was proud of. Just like so many Australians, my family had their lives changed by the opportunity to access education. My grandparents left school early, and the privilege to go to university was not one that was afforded to them. But Australia provided my parents and my generation with a different opportunity—the opportunity to achieve higher education. It didn't matter who you were or where you came from; that's what HECS was all about. I have spoken to countless members of our community who are facing the growing burden of HECS debts. For young people it's impacting how they consider their plans for the future. So over the weekend we announced that we'll be cutting 20 per cent off people's student debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really important for the 27,000 people in Macnamara who are currently facing and paying off a HECS debt. Someone with an average of $27,600 will see approximately $5,500 wiped from their loans next year. We've also announced changes to the HECS threshold, meaning you won't have to start paying off your loan until you're earning a higher wage. I know that this will make a difference to people in our community, not just when it comes to planning for the future. For so many across Macnamara it will take a little bit of pressure off the rising cost of living right now. Earlier this year we changed how indexation is calculated, and I know that that was important for our community. With the announcement this weekend, we are recognising that going to university is a privilege and an opportunity and that it can change your life. It is something we want to ensure that more Australians can access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To finish my contribution I also want to say how proud I am of the announcement that we will continue the rollout of fee-free TAFE and have a minimum of 100,000 places per year. This is an extraordinary Labor legacy and one that will create jobs, opportunity and really important and dignified work in our community. I am proud to be a part of the party that will deliver it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="74046" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOODENOUGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  I wish to place on the parliamentary record my strongest concerns regarding the Firearms Act 2024, which was rushed through the Western Australian parliament earlier this year on 19 June and was subsequently assented to eight days later on 27 June.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a constituency of 90,000 licensed firearm owners in Western Australia who deserve sensible and rational policymaking. I commend members of the National Party for their strong advocacy on behalf of sporting shooters. Following the Howard-era National Firearms Agreement, best practice has been for a nationally consistent approach to firearms regulation across Australia. It is clear that the Western Australian Labor government has gone it alone on this issue and introduced legislation which is not consistent across Australian jurisdictions. This legislation was rushed through parliament in record time with neither proper scrutiny nor proper stakeholder consultation. The result is different regulations in different states. No state should go it alone, as inconsistent firearms laws within Australia are not best practice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are several aspects of the legislation and regulations which are flawed and should be repealed or amended. Imposing numerical limits on the number of firearms which can be licensed is arbitrary in nature and cannot be supported by evidence or logic. Rigorous scrutiny should instead be applied on the initial licence application, as access to the first firearm is where the main risk is. Licensing subsequent firearms does not pose incremental levels of risk to public safety. There are more than 40 different types of recognised shooting competitions, each requiring different specialist firearms to participate. Avid competitive shooters can easily reach the maximum firearms limit by competing in just two or three disciplines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than a numerical limit on firearms able to be licensed, graduated storage requirements for firearm owners possessing more than 10 firearms should be introduced, such as the requirement for safes with higher specifications and monitored alarm systems and CCTV to mitigate the risk of theft. Financial members of accredited shooting clubs and organisations should be exempt from the 10-firearms limit because they have access to a registered shooting range in which to safely use their licensed firearms and demonstrate that they are actively interested in shooting disciplines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The requirement for firearms licence applicants to be interviewed by a police officer should be reintroduced, as was previously the case. Currently it is an online application with a 100-point ID verification at Australia Post. Applicants do not currently interact with a person who can assess their suitability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Restricting individual firearm use to specific properties is overly bureaucratic and serves no useful purpose. A recreational shooter typically enjoys an outdoor lifestyle of camping, caravanning and four-wheel driving and usually shoots on several properties in rural and regional areas. Provided a property is of equivalent size and has suitable typography and provided proper permission is obtained from the owner, shooting can be conducted safely, and there is no valid reason to restrict firearms to specific properties. In addition, recreational shooters who join accredited shooting clubs should be exempt from providing regular property letters, as they have legitimate access to a registered range in which to safely use their licensed firearms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I strongly oppose several elements of the Firearms Act 2024, which was rushed through the WA parliament earlier this year—in particular, the imposition of numerical limits on firearm ownership, restricting individual firearm use to specific properties and bureaucratic requirements imposed concerning the provision of property letters. I call upon the members of the Legislative Council of the Parliament of Western Australia to move disallowance motions and amendments to the legislation, with a view to reviewing the defective elements. It is clear that the Western Australian Labor government has gone it alone on this issue and introduced legislation which is not consistent across Australian jurisdictions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  I rise in this place today to speak on emergency management in my community, which is extremely important right now as South Australia enters fire danger season once again. Before jumping into the subject matter, I first want to address a relevant event that occurred in my community over the weekend. Most importantly, I want to pay tribute to the brave individuals who responded to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday 2 November, at around 2.30 pm local time, a grassfire was sparked in Penfield, just adjacent to my community's central urban corridor. This fire soon became out of control, with life-threatening conditions developing in minutes. Roads were closed across the affected areas, and residents were advised by the SA Country Fire Service, the CFS, to leave their homes due to the danger that was present. In just a matter of hours, 33 hectares or 81 acres of land was burned as the fire moved southward, with damage being caused to a shed and several glasshouses in the area. According to SA ambulance services, six people were treated by paramedics, with three of those individuals hospitalised due to smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion caused by the flames. By 4.50 pm, the threat was reduced, and the advice from the CFS was downgraded, having contained the fire by evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CFS, as well as their metropolitan counterparts, the MFS, had committed 42 crews to respond to the blaze and fought bravely to protect our community once more. It's due to their efforts that this threat was extinguished, with no home suffering damage in the end and no loss of human life, which is most important. To these men and women who give up their time, often as volunteers, to ensure the safety of us and our loved ones, to those who continue to stare down fire danger season and put their lives on the line for others in the most unimaginable of conditions, from the bottom of my heart and the hearts of everyone in the communities of the northern suburbs, thank you. Your efforts across the CFS and MFS embody the Australian spirit and make our community, our states and our nation all the better for it. I would also like to acknowledge the tireless paramedics for their efforts in treating members of our community who were affected by the fire, as well as the quick-thinking residents of Penfield who responded and assisted emergency services by following their advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As communities all across the country can attest, the impact of bushfires like this leaves devastating scars across our great landscape and even deeper ones in the hearts of Australian families. Communities north of Adelaide are no stranger to this, having suffered devastating losses due to fires at Pinery, Sampson Flat and Humbug Scrub just in the last decade alone. So having to follow the CFS alert throughout the summer and trawl their social media whilst watching the bushfire advice, anxiously waiting for updates to arrive with your loved ones, is something familiar to our community, and I wanted to take the opportunity to talk about what we're doing as a government to assist our firefighters keeping us safe. In my position, it's no good just thanking them for their efforts and leaving it at that. It's the role of government to support those firefighters, and I'm proud to be part of a federal government that is investing to do just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, alongside the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator the Hon. Jenny McAllister, I viewed the new Pickering UH-60L Blackhawk heavy-lift helicopter that is now on standby at Parafield Airport. This was part of a $48 million investment towards the national aerial firefighting fleet by the federal government. Crucially, alongside a 4,500-litre capacity for water to fight fires, the aircraft can facilitate other duties in emergency management with heavy-lift capabilities. This can include delivering food supplies and essential resources in times of emergency, not just during bushfire season but also during times of flood or extreme storms. The aircraft is now part of South Australia's largest aerial firefighting fleet on record, following a record investment by the state government as well. An asset like the Blackhawk helicopter doesn't go unnoticed in our community, because having something like this clearly visible just over Main North Road right in the middle of the northern suburbs helps bring assurance to our community that they are safe to live here. It does that by equipping our firefighting services with the best available tools at their disposal to safely and efficiently respond to these life-threatening events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, to all our emergency service personnel both in Spence and across the country, thank you for your service. To the community broadly at home, download the Alert SA app, keep up to date with emergencies in your area and remember to plan and prepare this fire season.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  The benefits of sport are well known. Sport improves our physical and mental health and teaches important values like teamwork, discipline and respect. A positive experience of community sport can be transformational, and for our kids it can lay foundations they carry for life. But the reality is not everyone has access to sport. The costs and time involved in playing team sport, being part of a club, paying for uniforms, committing to practice, and travelling to and from game simply are not an option for many families. That's why I'm a fan of Team Sport 4 All, an organisation that supports kids who otherwise couldn't be part of club life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It all started on Bluff Road in my electorate of Goldstein in 2007, with a few parents from the Hampton Rovers Football Club banding together to cover the costs for some kids whose families couldn't afford for them to play. From these humble beginnings in Bayside, Team Sport 4 All is now operating across the Melbourne metro area, with programs tailored to help address the barriers facing children and families who are underrepresented in sport. I'm so pleased that Team Sport 4 All is about to scale further, after receiving substantial funding through the government's Play Our Way program, which seeks to provide greater opportunities for women and girls to access, participate and remain involved in sport. Over the next three years this funding will support up to 1,510 seasons of sport for girls from low-income, welfare-dependent families, with a focus on expanding the program into two new locations and specific programs to open doors for girls from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to participate. Team Sport 4 All is all about addressing social isolation for the long-term and doing everything possible to keep kids active in a sporting community as they move through all the challenges of growing up. This is particularly relevant to girls, many of whom stop playing sport in their teenage years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the efforts of everyone involved in Team Sport 4 All, including their more than 60 volunteers, but there's more work to do if sport is to be truly equal in Australia. That's why I am fighting for female-friendly change rooms across Goldstein, specifically at the Sandringham Football Club at the landmark Trevor Barker Oval. Currently, there is only one open space for players to get changed in, which has one toilet cubicle, an open urinal and no private showers, just four showerheads side-by-side. With the dramatic rise in the numbers of girls and women playing AFL, this setup is outdated and inappropriate. Girls should not have to get dressed in their cars to play sport. While we work towards this, I congratulate Team Sport 4 All and encourage further support for their efforts in bringing more of our kids off the sidelines and onto the field.</span>

On Friday 18 October I was greatly honoured to be invited by the Palestinian community to a vigil hosted by PARA, the Palestine Australia Relief and Action group. PARA helps Palestinian migrants and refugees live safe, happy and fulfilling lives in Australia, and is led by Australian Palestinians. Their mission is to feature and strengthen Palestinian voices and to help newly arrived Palestinians settle in. Collingwood Town Hall was decorated with 15,000 kites created by the PARA community to honour the memories of people who have been lost in the conflict and the trauma that lingers on. There was hardly a dry eye amongst us as we learned about their strength, resilience and struggles, of loved ones being torn apart, of futures stolen.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to this vigil, I met with some of the families PARA support and I heard about their homeland and what their lives were like before they left. We shared a wonderful meal together at the Preston Market. For many of these families, it was the first time they'd connected with others who have had to flee Gaza. Together, they are rebuilding their lives in our community, seeking a life of peace and prosperity. These people are human, no different from you and me. They're doctors, IT specialists, students and teachers. They're mothers, fathers, daughters and sons. But, among the stories of horror and heartache, we heard hope—hope for a better life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that everyone in this place knows I feel very strongly about. It's an issue I know my constituents feel strongly about, and I'm proud to come from a community that welcomes refugees with open arms, because together we are stronger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I'd like to congratulate the year 12 graduating classes of 2024, some of whom I've had the pleasure of getting to know over the last few years at Preston High School. The school has continued to thrive since opening in 2019. I want to make special mention of Sean Butler, the principal; and Jessica James, the assistant principal, who have built the school from the ground up. Last month I welcomed my friend and former prime minister Julia Gillard to the school to open a new building that the students voted to name in her honour. It's called the Gillard Building and houses the Tony Birch library, science labs, art and design studios, and multiple classrooms. We also caught up with the Ged Kearney scholars, a group of wonderful young women I mentor to develop their leadership and change-making skills—our future women leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Preston has brought up some of the brightest students I've ever met, and I can't wait to see what these graduates will go on to achieve. I pay tribute to teachers across the entire government school system, especially those in my electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  Last week I spoke to a woman my electorate whose story has stayed with me. Cherie lives in a two-bedroom house with her husband and her three neurodiverse children in Wodonga. The high cost of living and the additional cost of care and support for her children means Cherie's family are in severe financial stress. They now face a 10 per cent rent increase, which they simply cannot afford. Their search for a new rental is fruitless—knocked back in application after application. Cherie told me: 'We are trapped in this constant cycle of renting and moving every year. We will never be able to give our kids stability or a permanent home.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish I could say this was an exceptional story, but it isn't. That's why I'm working every single day to put forward practical solutions in this place that will help families in my electorate find a stable home. For more than two years I've been working for greater Commonwealth investment in the enabling infrastructure that we need to unlock more housing. I knew this is where we should focus because it's what I heard from families trying to build new homes, from local governments trying to unlock more housing and from the builders and developers ready to break ground. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Independent member for Indi I have taken stories like Cherie's and the experiences in my region and created policy solutions that would meet those needs and, specifically, to open up more land for housing and more land with water connections, power connections—power, pavement, poles. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I welcome the coalition's recent announcement of a housing infrastructure fund which mirrors my calls for a $2 billion regional housing infrastructure fund. It's why I welcomed the government's Housing Support Program when it was announced last year, just one week after I put my infrastructure plan to the Prime Minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is we now have both major parties singing the same tune and understanding that, if we're going to solve this housing crisis, it's going to start with more pipes, paths and poles. It also shows the crucial role of the crossbench in driving forward the policy debate in this country. From housing to integrity to the energy transition, the crossbench is working constructively with industry experts and the community to put forward practical and ambitious policies that address the challenges we face as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't stomach it when the major parties play politics over housing. It does nothing to help people like Cherie and her family. It is why every single day I'm working hard with my community to deliver solutions that will help more Australians into stable and secure homes where they and their families can thrive.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  Access to a good education can set you up for life. That's why we're making it easier to access and more affordable for more people in our community, no matter what career they're looking to get into. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our community, more than 16,600 people have had their student or apprenticeship debt slashed this year by the Albanese government. I'm pleased to let you know that that wasn't one-off. It's being locked in, with the announcement yesterday that a re-elected Albanese government next year would wipe 20 per cent off your student debt. I'm pleased to let you know that that wasn't a one-off—it's being locked in with the announcement yesterday that a re-elected Albanese government next year would wipe 20 per cent off your student debt. That includes student debt for TAFE or university as well as for apprentices. It will mean uni students in our community will have about $5,500 taken off the average university HECS-HELP debt. Only an Albanese government will also raise the repayment thresholds so you won't have to worry about repaying your student loans until you're actually earning a decent wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all. In Western Australia almost 20,000 people have had the opportunity to experience the Albanese government's fee-free TAFE. That has been life-changing for so many in our community having the chance to skill-up or retrain into a career that they want. We want to see more tradies available to build homes, more apprentices getting a start, more healthcare, disability, aged-care and childcare workers looking after our loved ones, and more training for people who dream for a job on the mines, with more opportunity to get ahead. That's why only a re-elected Albanese government will be making that permanent, locking fee-free TAFE into law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is delivering for our community. We've slashed inflation to an almost four-year low, we've worked with WA Labor to deliver a $700 energy bill relief for every household, and we've increased the subsidy for child care and are capping childcare fee increases. We've also made medicines cheaper for you. We are continuing to work hard each and every day for you, moving forward with a new bulk-billed Medicare urgent care clinic, two Medicare mental health centres, and infrastructure projects like the extension of the Armadale line to Byford, the upgrades to Tonkin Highway and the grade separation at Nicholson Road and Garden Street. I'm proud to be delivering for you, building a better Burt and building Australia's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the opportunity also to give a massive shoutout to the local legends who once again pulled off an awesome Kelmscott Agricultural Show. This year we celebrated 125 years, the longest-running agricultural show in Western Australia. Congratulations as well to my mum, a long-running Kelmscott show competition entrant who got a first for her beans and a second for her cardigan, as well as to my son Nicholas, who took out the honey joy competition. Congratulations to all winners, all the dedicated volunteers who pulled it off, and everyone who supported the show and came on down to have a great time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  A quick round-the-grounds from the Groom electorate. I know you and all assembled members will agree the best part of Australia is in our great Darling Downs. We had the Jacaranda Festival back again out at Goombungee. It has been two years, and it was a great day out with thousands of people lining the streets. It was great to see so much attention and money pumping through that local economy to keep those small towns alive. A quick shoutout to Tom at the Pioneer Arms Hotel. I ordered a half-pint and he upgraded me to a full pint—I did pay for it and I didn't ask for it. A quick joke there for Tom and I.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beef City turns 50! Red meat is such a huge part of our local economy and we went out for the celebrations out there. It's a really great story for Beef City—their first ever account was with the Japanese agricultural department providing red meat to Japan. After the Second World War Japan were keen to make sure they never again had the food shortages they had then, and we've played a key part in that. Japan has been a great investor in our region, in Beef City, Oakey Beef and the Acland coal mine. It was a great day out. Congratulations to everyone who has been involved over a long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">W Coffee and Co in the Australia Arcade—a little bit too close to my office—had a soft launch of their cocktail evenings on a Friday night. The best espresso martinis in Toowoomba is their claim—I think they're pretty good. Congratulations to Jordy. I'll give a quick shoutout across the arcade for Dead Ringer Records. It's a great little shop that's expanding and has a great selection of records. I picked up the Eurythmics' <span style="font-style:italic;">Touch</span>, a 1983 classic, for 20 bucks. Get in there and support local businesses—it's so important we see those arcades growing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went out to the Toowoomba Women's Shed. We often talk about men's sheds, but the women's shed in Toowoomba is absolutely fantastic. I walked in on a slow day and there were 25 women there working all sorts of things that are needed across our community, from school bags to things used in hospitals to give people a bit of extra comfort, Christmas gifts, blankets and wraps for kids. It's fantastic to go in there and see so many women working so hard and enjoying each other's company. It's a great thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we also farewelled the chancellor Uni SQ—the University of Southern Queensland—John Dornbusch has served three terms as our chancellor and he's been on the council 25 years. He has given so much to our community and we thank him very much for his service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also this week, we heard that the Vice-Chancellor, Geraldine Mackenzie, will be moving on. Geraldine, thank you so much for everything that you've done for UniSQ, not just in my electorate but across the broader region. I particularly want to point out the $50 million you got in iLAuNCH funding, the biggest investment that UniSQ has ever had from any level of government. Geraldine, you played a huge part in that. We thank you very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Loads of Love starts up this week. To Gus Romero and all the guys involved in that, thank you for that great initiative, which is putting food on the tables of people in need across Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the last one I'm going to shout out is Smithy's TGW Gym, which has a big fight. Jackson Griffith, or Stoneleigh as he fights under, is up against Miguel Vazquez. This should be a great fight, a great Friday night out at Rumours International. Be there!</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  I recently met four incredible student leaders from St Kilda Primary School, which is one of the very best schools in our local community. These young female leaders are a true credit to that fantastic school. Each submitted to the Raise Our Voice campaign, with answers to the question 'what do you want your community to look like in the next 10 years, and what can the next parliament do to achieve it?' It was their collective vision for the future of our St Kilda community that made their presentations so powerful. So I've taken a piece from each of their contributions to read here, in this chamber, today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tess wrote about our wonderful community she sees on the way to school and what she hopes to see in the future:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The walks improve by the day, because every day our community improves. There is less rubbish and more nature. People bicycle to and from work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">Locals greet each other as they pass, because we have no reason to be separated as a community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We finally understand that we are all on this journey together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is a wonderful sentiment from Tess.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I dream that every future step we take will be forwards, never running backwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Iris and Hannah wrote about the need for open spaces for our children and community to thrive. They said around 80 per cent of children that live in St Kilda live in apartments with only five per cent community space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For these reasons, St Kilda Primary school needs a new hall. It would significantly help because not only would it host important events for the school, but children would run food drives, op shops, charities and migrant families could take lessons in English.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Stella wrote passionately, echoing her fellow students' call for a community hub:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have research saying that 60% of Balaclava and 81% of St Kilda live in apartments. That means lots of people around our area don't have much outdoor space. That's where we come in. It would be awesome for the kids mental and physical health. It won't just be for the kids, everyone around us will also have the opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stella ends with, 'Even though I may not be there, I would love to have contributed to this journey.' And I think that is a wonderful sentiment from Stella, demonstrating her advocacy—that even after she leaves St Kilda Primary School she seeks a future for the school that future students will enjoy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to Tess, Iris, Hannah and Stella for sharing your visions for the future with me. We will get to work to try and make them a reality.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  Thank you to everyone in our community involved with Pink Up Penrith, particularly the dedicated committee, led by Gai Hawthorn of the Penrith CBD Corporation. This month-long initiative in October has once again shown us the power of community spirit in supporting a cause close to everyone's hearts—raising funds for the McGrath Foundation to support McGrath Breast Care Nurses. Over the last few years, Pink Up Penrith has raised an extraordinary $362,000, allowing five McGrath Breast Care Nurses to be stationed at Nepean Hospital. These nurses play a vital role in the lives of patients and their families, providing not just medical expertise but compassionate care, guidance and hope during what is often the most difficult time in people's live. It is because of these dedicated community efforts that the people of Penrith can access these five wonderful nurses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, to help spread the important message of early detection, I was really proud to join Penrith CBD Corporation to sponsor special breast cancer awareness decals, which are perfect to stick on the door of bathrooms in shops, in gyms and in hotels. I've loved seeing them popping up in venues right across Penrith. Thank you to every small business and community member for being involved in this initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pink Up Penrith hosted a series of events that demonstrated the community's unwavering commitment to the McGrath Foundation's breast care nurses. Among these is the high tea at Lakeside Restaurant. I had the privilege of joining a room full of passionate and generous individuals, including the Director of the McGrath Foundation, Tracy Bevan, who has given a lot of her time to supporting this cause in Penrith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had the United in Pink dance event, organised by Rebecca from PAWS. We had a whole evening of wonderful dance schools participating not for competition but for community. The amount of money that our local dance schools raised was wonderful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of the Pink Up Penrith committee, led by Gai, deserves the highest praise. Organising such a wide array of events is no easy feat, yet every detail is always meticulously planned, and everything goes off wonderfully. Most of all, Pink Up Penrith is about people in our community giving generously. The total funds raised this year are yet to be finalised, but I know they will be a figure that reflects the effort that's been put in. To Gai Hawthorn, the Pink Up Penrith committee and every volunteer and participant: my deepest gratitude is extended to you all. Your dedication reminds us that together we can make a difference.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  We live in a world where global interactions are part of everyday life. We're used to watching events from across the world in real time, and it's easy to make quick, careless observations. Each story only takes a minute or so of screen time. But it has never been more important to understand each other deeply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October I was part of the Global Dialogue exchange program in India. The Global Public Policy Institute, based in Berlin, in partnership with the Australian National University's National Security College, brought together German and Australian parliamentarians for trilateral meetings, including a meeting with India's Minister for External Affairs, Dr Jaishankar. The program is generously supported by the Robert Bosch foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Jaishankar has had an immensely impressive career serving as India's ambassador to both China and the United States. He offers a perspective that we need to consider carefully and seriously. He advised in 2022 that Europe 'has to grow out of the mindset that Europe's problems are the world's problems but the world's problems are not Europe's problems'. To this end, in our meeting he spoke frankly about the positive refocus on the Indo-Pacific. I take this as a reminder that we are all interconnected and need to understand this and our different perspectives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians particularly need to understand the importance of India as one of the fastest growing economies and soon to be the third-largest economy. Even within my own electorate, Punjabi is the second most commonly spoken language, with Gujarati not far behind. We need to understand how we capitalise on the brain chain that exists now between our nations. Throughout the week, we discussed maritime security, emerging technology and climate as well as regional issues of concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">India is also an extraordinary democracy. While sitting in their new parliament I was struck by the fact that each of India's 543 members of the Lok Sabha, the House of the People, serves up to 2.5 million constituents. It's a beautiful, fascinating country. We visited the Lodhi Gardens, a city park in New Delhi that presents a microcosm of India's extraordinary history, with examples of how Hindu and Islamic architecture has learnt from and been influenced by each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first visited India at the age of 16 and continue to be struck by its immense variety. It has elements that we are so familiar with, such as cricket, as well as elements that we must simply observe with wonder and, I hope, intense curiosity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How and when do we work together? How do we understand each other better? For all of us, it was a lesson in respect—the respect that comes from listening and learning and embracing the challenge of difference rather than shrinking away from it. When we look at each other squarely, honestly and with respect, our relationships will grow.</span>

It was a great event that celebrated the entrepreneurship of the business community in the Greater Shepparton region and the Goulburn Valley more widely. I want to share with the House—with everyone—the names of some of the winners of the business awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, Watters Electrical, a famous company in Shepparton, which does great work, was inducted into the business Hall of Fame. Credit to all the team and the owner, Robin Knaggs. JMB Modular Buildings won the Excellence in Innovation award. James Lelliott from Goulburn Valley Health and Janica Mendoza from SPC tied as Young Professional of the Year. They're doing amazing work in the Greater Shepparton region. Sonia Strachan, the dedicated prostate cancer nurse at Goulburn Valley Health, won Excellence in Customer Service: Professional Services. She's been doing amazing things, helping people who are going through the prostate cancer process. Flavorite Tatura won Excellence in Food and Agribusiness, a great grower of greenhouse tomatoes and other vegetables. Greg Pearson Building and Brett Collins Refrigeration tied for Excellence in Customer Services: Trade Services. I used Greg Pearson Building for a renovation a number of years ago and it was a wonderful experience. It's a great local business. The Museum of Vehicle Evolution, MOVE, won Visitor Experience of the Year. If you want to see a great display of trucks and buses, go to MOVE in Shepparton. Elsewhere at SAM, at the Shepparton Art Museum, won Excellence in Customer Service: Retail/Hospitality Services. Trelly's Outdoor won the Best Marketing/Advertising Campaign. Everyday Supplies won Excellence in Business: Retail Services. GAME Traffic &amp; Contracting won Excellence in Business: Trade Services. A wonderful local marketing company called So Creative, Olivia and Steph, won the Excellence in Business: Professional Services award, and they do an amazing job. Tricon Electrical Group won Emerging and Micro Business of the Year, and Xavier Hutchison from SPC won Apprenticeship/Trainee of the Year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These businesses and people are really what makes the Goulburn Valley tick. We're very proud of our entrepreneurial spirit. We're proud of the people who get out there and have a go and use their creativity, their skills and their education to try to drive business forward. There were many nominees and all were deserving, but the people I've just mentioned were the winners. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we need to do more to acknowledge our small businesses and our businesses in the regions. They really do drive our economy along, and it's wonderful, particularly, to see young people who are starting businesses or getting involved in businesses—like Xavier Hutchison, starting out his apprenticeship at SPC—get the recognition they deserve. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  On Saturday 26 October, I attended the SIEVX Memorial at Weston Park in Canberra, with SIEVX Memorials Association ACT, for the 23rd anniversary commemorations of the SIEVX tragedy. The memorial honours each of the 353 asylum seekers who lost their lives, with a dedicated pole representing each life lost. The tragedy occurred in October 2001, in international waters, somewhere between Australia and Indonesia, where a vessel carrying around 400 asylum seekers capsized. Three hundred and fifty-three people died, the majority of them women and children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This memorial in Weston Park stands to honour those lives, but it's also a monument to the compassion of the Australian community, and the effort that went into establishing that memorial and to caring for it is a really powerful symbol of that. The memorial itself includes 353 poles. There are taller poles, representing adults who lost their lives, and smaller poles representing children. They are arranged so that one part of the memorial shows the actual size of the boat that all these people were on. You can stand in there and only imagine how that many people would fit into that tiny space and the terror that they experienced. Each of the poles has artwork on it by a school, an individual, a community organisation or a church from around Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay particular tribute today to SIEVX Memorial Association ACT for the work they do in maintaining the memorial. They have volunteers who come and mow the grass around the poles. They have also been restoring the art, and it's a really beautiful job that they've done. There are too many to name, but I do want to name Paul Meyer and Lauren Honcope, and Sophie Singh and John Minns from the Refugee Action Campaign Canberra, for the work they do there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to represent an electorate that cares deeply about asylum seekers and refugees. This is one of the issues that I first became politically active in, and I want to assure you again that it's something I'll always advocate for within our government. There have been a group of people meeting outside my office on Thursdays, and I was happy to meet with them and chat with them. They are particularly raising awareness of people caught in the fast-track process. I just want to mention here that those are 10,000 Australians living in limbo at the moment, and this is an issues I will continue to raise within our government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) that Australia has an animal welfare crisis, and that cruelty is commonplace in greyhound and horse racing, live exports, the industrial production of food and fibre, rodeos, and puppy and kitten farms;</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(i) intensive commercial dog breeding facilities in Tasmania which operated under grossly inhumane and inadequate conditions, where female dogs were forced to breed at appalling rates;</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(ii) the treatment of dogs in the greyhound racing industry, which results in unbearable cruelty, injury and even death, for example, in 2024 alone there have been almost 100 on-track deaths and 8,449 injuries Australia-wide; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      23pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(iii) overbreeding of retired racehorses, where the aim is to produce as many foals as possible that might one day generate a return on investment and sadly, as in the case of Black Caviar, this is poorly regulated and often involves almost constant pregnancy and birthing for so-called 'retired' horses, dramatically increasing the risks of injury, infection and death; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) establish a statutory Independent Office of Animal Welfare which will take a leadership role on animal welfare matters at a federal level, including developing a national animal welfare strategy, conducting inquiries and reviews into the effectiveness and implementation of our animal welfare laws; and providing independent, science-based advice to governments on animal welfare issues; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) work with states and territories to improve, harmonise and implement strict animal welfare standards, guidelines and laws.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would add that cruelty to animals is something I have long stood against in this place because, like most in the community, we understand that animal cruelty is just plain wrong. It is of course also a shocking reflection on the ethics and character of those who inflict it or turn a blind eye to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine the community's shock, then, when in 2013 the Abbott government abolished the national strategy for animal welfare and its advisory committee. Imagine the community's dismay when the consequence of that decision was that animal welfare standards became the sole preserve of the states and territories. After all, this is the level of government who have consistently done a terrible job safeguarding animals and clearly can't be trusted. No wonder we welcome this government's commitment to at least re-establish an animal welfare strategy, with $5 million set aside for that purpose in the last budget. But it's only a small step and is well short of the comprehensive national oversight needed, because we have drifted into an undeniable animal welfare crisis, and that's where we'll stay without reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This crisis is particularly acute where commodification and profits intersect with animal welfare. For example, many in my home state of Tasmania are appalled by revelations as recent as today about conditions in the state's largest puppy mill, Tasmanian Labradoodles. Mercifully, a lengthy legal battle finally led to the RSPCA closing the mill in July and rehoming more than 250 dogs. But the reality is that many puppy mills still legally exist across the country, using dogs as breeding machines for profit, with some puppies fetching many thousands of dollars each. And, in the process, the breeding animals are often deprived of even their own most basic needs and spend their lives in crates or cages, bearing litter after litter. Rarely if ever are they allowed out to run, play or curl up on the couch with the family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of the crisis is the greyhound racing industry, where welfare issues are well documented and widespread. They are clearly not the result of a few bad apples, as some would have you believe. No wonder my office is constantly contacted by members of the community who share my disgust with this industry and its appalling treatment of dogs. Frankly, shame on the industry for the outrageous levels of injury and death, physical overexertion, inadequate housing, lack of socialisation and environmental enrichment, cruel training practices, illegal live baiting, administration of banned or unregistered substances and euthanasia of poorly performing or unwanted dogs. Indeed, just since lodging my notice for this motion last month, the number of reported on-track deaths this year has increased from 98 to 116. Track injuries have grown to 8,449 to 9,508. Moreover, 43—or one in every six—dogs 'retired' from the industry in the last year has been killed, which is appalling. It is even more so when you consider that Australia has the largest greyhound racing industry in the world and is one of just seven countries where it's still legal. But, of course, the $4 billion waged annually on greyhound racing gives you a clue as to why governments have continued to turn a blind eye to this reckless cruelty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting that the Melbourne Cup is tomorrow, let's not forget the horse racing industry, where seven horses have died running the Cup in the last decade. One horse is killed on an Australian racetrack every two days. Again, there's the issue of overbreeding, as illustrated shockingly in the case of Black Caviar, who, in the 10 years since her so-called retirement, was forced to bear nine foals before becoming sick and being euthanised. That is not an unusual story—broodmares routinely being constantly either pregnant or lactating or both for their entire breeding lives, without any substantial rest, and ending up with complex health problems. Indeed, mares in Australia are forced to bear around 15,000 foals each year, only about 30 per cent of which ever make it to the track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this is to say that we're in a crisis and that we should be working to fix it. That's why I'm moving this motion, calling on the government to set up an independent office of animal welfare, an agency which can take a leadership role in developing and overseeing animal welfare in Australia and bring the states and territories to the table to improve standards and to address this crisis. To do anything less is unconscionable complicity in ongoing cruelty.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I care about the welfare of animals. It is a vital part of being a responsible human being. It is a hallmark of understanding that special position of being human and the responsibilities that that entails. We cannot behave with reckless disregard, let alone cruelty, towards any being on this planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many parents try to teach their children about caring and mindfulness by guiding their interaction with their pet. Properly done, it's training in consideration, respect and tenderness. That tenderness should extend past the days of cuteness of puppies and kittens and past the days when an animal is an active investment. If you truly love an animal, you are alert to its suffering and do what you can to prevent it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to see this motion. We do need to remind ourselves on a regular basis of our duties in this space. The strength of animal welfare standards is a direct reflection of our nation's convictions about life on earth. Carelessness or casual disregard also results in serious problems—for example, with regard to biosecurity, which is vital to Australian primary industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government supports strong animal-welfare standards, not only because we believe in what people like to describe as humane attitudes on all sorts of issues, but because we care. The coalition, including the National Party, took no commitments on animal welfare to the last election. It must have slipped their minds. Labor did make election commitments on animal welfare, and we are delivering. Since we came to office in 2022, we have committed $5 million across the four years to the renewal of the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy. This strategy was last active in 2014. Not entirely coincidentally, that was one year after the coalition came to power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Animal welfare does need national leadership. Reinvigorating the strategies sends the message that needs to be sent, both domestically and to overseas markets. The agreement between the Australian government, state and territory governments, animal industries and animal welfare groups has to be regularly revised, to ensure that we are achieving our goals in light of the ongoing research and development. We do need a strong framework and a nationwide approach to animal welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this funding we've injected into the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy will make sure that it has clear visions and priorities and, of course, a set of practical actions. In its renewed form, it will address the needs of all animals, including livestock, aquatic animals and companion animals, as well as animals used for work, sport, recreation, research and teaching. The renewal of the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy is a job for those who believe in bringing people together, listening to each other and of course learning from each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a land in which we've seen the introduction of rabbits, followed by the introduction of foxes, not to mention cane toads, we understand that issues relating to animals' lives have to be considered very carefully and they are never settled or set in stone. The Albanese government is demonstrating, in real, practical terms, our commitment to an approach to animal welfare that is sustainable and based on the best available research and evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of September this year, Dr Katherine Clift was appointed as Australia's new Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports for a five-year term. This inspectorate was also created by this government. Dr Clift will be undertaking order and review functions aimed at strengthening animal welfare assurance in a way that is informed by the kind of broad experience that we do need. She grew up on a farm, has worked as a rural veterinarian and has a deep understanding of the regulatory programs. As a Western Australian, I'm particularly grateful for her work already with the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development. Western Australia is well on the way to addressing many of the concerns raised by the member for Clark. Puppy farming has been outlawed, and there are progressive steps to correct the abuses in the racing industries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Believing in and demonstrating strong animal welfare standards is vital to the international reputation of our animal and agricultural industries, and it's important for us here at home. It shows that cruelty and casual disregard appal us. We can't shrug our shoulders at cruelty or callousness of any kind, anywhere. I thank the member for Clark for the motion and I commend the work of the former minister, Minister Watt, Minister Collins and the department and staff who work to make life better not just for us but for the animals we live alongside. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  Like the vast majority of Australians, I'm an animal lover. As a child I regularly holidayed with my family on our property near Trunkey Creek, where I learned to herd the sheep, drag them out for shearing and sort the wool. I helped them lamb and I rode our half-wild horses around the property. We went to agricultural shows and rodeos, and we regularly cared for poddy goats and lambs. Mum bred pedigree dogs that were showered with the love of a young family. But for a country which loves animals and which has relied on animals in so many ways over the centuries—for transport, food, fibre, sport, work on farms, assistance in dealing with disabilities and companionship—there are far too many ways in which Australia mistreats them. The Australian Alliance for Animals recently stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reality is, our laws, standards, and regulatory systems on the whole, are failing animals. This is because within the current governance system there are conflicts of interests among those in power, inconsistencies across states and territories, loopholes in laws, and standards that ignore science and community expectations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me talk about the widespread cruelty of one industry as an example, the greyhound racing industry. In 2017, following a damning investigation, the multibillion dollar Australian greyhound racing industry vowed to clean up its act. The investigation had exposed the preventable deaths of as many as 17,000 young dogs each year. Sadly, despite a short-lived ban, a former chief veterinarian has again revealed that widespread abuse continues in this industry, with dogs being raced at 'barbaric' rates, euthanised without cause or left to rot in metal cages when they can no longer compete. Then there are the puppy farms. As the RSPCA describes, breeding dogs may be kept in overcrowded conditions or extreme confinement, with some never let out of cages. They may live in constant fear or stress, are never socialised and do not receive basic care such as exercise, grooming, vaccinations or the veterinary care they may need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's not time today to discuss in detail the many other examples of animal cruelty being permitted to continue in Australia, including live animal export. State and territory governments have quite simply failed to do enough. So it is to be commended that the federal Labor government has committed to releasing a new Australian animal welfare strategy. Australia had such a strategy in the past, but in 2014, as Prime Minister, Tony Abbott withdrew funding and disbanded the animal welfare unit within the federal agriculture department—just another example of another backward step. It's pleasing to see this government take up the issue in its first term, albeit at a slow pace. The August 2024 report from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry simply provides an overview of a first tranche of consultation designed to inform the renewal of the animal welfare strategy. It shows that there is much to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Mackellar certainly expects action on this issue. Since being elected, around 2½ years ago, I've received hundreds of emails from constituents expressing profound concern about animal welfare. They have expressed their horror in relation to everything from live animal export to greyhound racing, from puppy farms to horseracing—particularly topical given that the race that stops the nation is on tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so I urge the government to act with alacrity to reintroduce an animal welfare strategy. As the member for Clark is advocating in this place today, an important part of this strategy must be the establishment of an independent office for animal welfare. Such an independent body is critical to minimise the influence of vested interests, such as the gambling industry, on decisions. Even in today's paper, it was reported that in the past decade over $2.7 million in donations from the gambling industry have been made towards major political parties—Liberal, Labor and the Nationals. Donations from the biggest companies involved in horse betting to the major parties increased from $66,000 in 2013 to $488,000 in 2022-23, an increase of over 600 per cent. This is precisely why it's essential that an independent office of animal welfare be established. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I rise to speak on this important motion brought by the member for Clark and thank him for bringing it into the parliament. Australia has not had a government so committed to animal welfare as the current government, and I'm very proud to be a part of it. We believe in strong animal welfare standards, and we believe that all animals should be treated humanely. This is something that my constituents also care deeply about. In fact, one of the first and definitely one of the biggest letter-writing campaigns I received in 2019 was about the live sheep export trade, and this was in the wake of damning evidence of animal cruelty in that industry. I know that many colleagues from around the country have similarly had many constituents get in touch with them around this. Back then, I wrote to the then agriculture minister, David Littleproud, calling on him to end this trade. I'm incredibly proud that it was a Labor government that was able to get this important reform through, something that my constituents demanded, that rank-and-file members mobilised for across the country and that former agriculture minister Murray Watt was able to make happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the previous speakers have highlighted, this week we will see the running of the Melbourne Cup, the race that once 'stopped a nation'. While many Australians continue to tune in every year, a growing number of Australians do not feel the same excitement as they once did. Light has been shone on poor animal welfare outcomes in the racing industry and a growing number of Australians no longer want to be part of this event. As this motion highlights, we've seen absolutely terrible outcomes for animals, particularly in the greyhound racing industry. This year, we've already seen almost 100 on-track deaths and almost 8,500 injuries. For horses, the story is no better. Between August 2021 and July 2022, 139 horses died. At least one horse dies every two days on Australian race tracks. In Victoria, the jumps racing industry still exists. Jumps racing is 20 times more dangerous to horses than flat racing. Every other state and territory has already banned this practice. In August of this year, three horses were killed during a single event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the growing sense of community frustration with this industry, and so does our government. Since coming to power, we have strengthened our national approach to animal welfare. We're delivering on key election commitments and have committed $5 million to the renewal of the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy. Earlier this year, the government confirmed our commitment to jointly lead the renewal of the strategy, confirming our commitment to a modern, sustainable, evidence based and science based approach to animal welfare. We're demonstrating that Australia's strong animal welfare standards are important to strengthen the reputation of our animal and agricultural industries with trading partners and the community. Our funding will ensure that the strategy includes a vision, key priorities and practical actions. The final strategy is scheduled to be released in 2027.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The renewal of the strategy will be undertaken in collaboration with state and territory governments and in consultation with industry and animal welfare stakeholders. This is in stark contrast to the coalition. Unbelievably, the coalition took no commitments on animal welfare to the last election, showing their complete disregard for the importance of strong animal welfare standards to the Australian people. As the previous speaker, the member for Mackellar, drew attention to, the previous Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, actually abolished the part of the department with responsibility for animal welfare, which is shameful. I am proud that Labor is taking a different approach to this, and, once again, I want to thank the member for Clark for bringing forward this important motion to the House today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former teacher in government schools and as someone who went through the government system at both primary and secondary level, I certainly want public education to be the best it can be. It is where the majority of Australian families send their children to school. It's accessible to everyone and should offer the best standards of teaching and learning. But the reality is that, to build a better and fairer education system, we need greater investment in public education. It's that simple. That's why our education minister has put $16 billion on the table to fairly and fully fund all schools. This would be the greatest ever increase in Commonwealth funding to public schools. The Albanese government recognises education is the most powerful catalyst to individual achievement, personal wellbeing and the prosperity of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 10 years, our $16 billion proposal will pay for half of the five per cent gap in the Schooling Resource Standard funding, with the states and territories paying the remainder. We're working closely with the states and territories to make this a reality. Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have already signed the agreement. But it's not a blank cheque. The dollars are tied to key reforms for students to catch-up, keep up, excel and, importantly, complete year 12. With this approach we want to close the education gap. It was a chasm under the former coalition government, who did nothing to increase educational standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reforms, targets and transparency are at the heart of our agenda, which includes three priority areas: equity and excellence, wellbeing for learning and engagement, and a strong and sustainable workforce. To achieve these priority areas, the $16 billion of additional funding will be tied to the following reforms: year 1 phonics checks and numeracy checks to identify students who need extra help; intensive supports, such as catch-up tutoring, to help students who fall behind; greater wellbeing support for students, including counsellors, wellbeing coordinators and mental health workers; attracting and retaining teachers and school leaders through rewards and recognitions; and supporting our teachers and school leaders with quality curriculum resources developed in partnership with the teaching profession. Under these reforms, by 2030, we aim to significantly improve the proportion of students completing year 12, with an increase of 7.5 per cent from 2022 rates. This will be the highest rate of year 12 certification ever achieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also investing in crucial school infrastructure, particularly in fast-growing areas like mine in the electorate of Corangamite in Victoria. On top of the $16 billion proposal to achieve better and fairer education standards, the Albanese Labor government is investing more than $280 million through the Schools Upgrade Fund. In my home state of Victoria, $48 million is being provided for vital infrastructure projects. In my electorate, almost $260,000 in upgrades has been delivered to local schools as part of our Schools Upgrade Fund, including Drysdale Primary School, with $9,800 provided for new classroom IT equipment; Inverleigh Primary School, with $170,000 provided for an undercover basketball court; Mirripoa Primary School in Mount Duneed, with $40,000 provided for football oval fencing; and Surf Coast Secondary College, with $39,210 for outdoor fitness equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition ripped billions of dollars out of government schools. This is their legacy. The Albanese government's legacy will be different. We are committed to funding government schools alongside the states and territories to make sure that we have a public education system that provides the best outcomes for Australian students and for our future prosperity.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  A robust education system focused on educational outcomes and opportunities is the foundation of our society and the individual. As I said in my first speech, education is the foundation to create a great life. It's my fundamental belief that the crucial element to lift people out of poverty and for them to build a better life for themselves and their communities is a strong education system, a system focused on delivering tangible education outcomes for students to set them up for long-term success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so important that we do all we can to lift student outcomes. Governments have invested billions in education. Unfortunately, results have been going backwards. It is important that we provide parents with choice in their education of their children. Personally, I was lucky to be raised by my mum, who was a teacher, and is still a teacher, in a public school. My wife is a teacher aide in one of our local schools, and so I've seen firsthand the impact that teachers and teacher aides have on the students. So I want to take a moment to pay tribute to all teachers, to all teacher aids—to everyone in the education system. They give so much back to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is crucial, but, unfortunately, we have another motion on a Monday from the government that talks a big game but doesn't actually deliver, when you dig down into the detail. Let's use one example of the Minister for Education talking a big game but not delivering the actual outcome for students, for teachers and for the community. In 2022, the Minister for Education promised that Labor would provide $68.3 million to fund up to 2,260 high-achieving teachers who would be fast-tracked into classrooms most in need. Like always, it was a big announcement, and there was big hoopla about this important announcement. However, in September this year, the government quietly announced that it's going to spend $70.9 million and is only going to deliver 1,497 teachers. That is hundreds of positions short of what was promised. It's clear they have no plan to address the teacher shortages that are impacting communities right across Australia. Minister Clare has been missing in action on urgent reforms needed, such as teacher training, including the explicit teaching of behaviour in their curriculum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But don't take my word for it that the federal Labor government are letting down the Australian people. Let's go to the Victorian ALP Minister for Education, Minister Ben Carroll. He was critical of the federal Labor government and their funding; he was asked to clarify whether the previous coalition government had done a better job in funding public schools, and Mr Carroll replied that yes, they had. The Victorian ALP Minister for Education confirmed that the former coalition government did a better job funding public schools than the current federal Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see the words 'on the table' in the motion, and the reason this money is on the table is that the government have not been able to land agreements with Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT. We have a government again patting themselves on the back for the great job they're doing, but in reality they haven't delivered for five states and territories across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, education is crucial to our community. Recently, I was lucky enough to visit St Andrews and Wonga Park primary schools, which are new schools in my electorate. My daughter had fun making honey joys out of the recipe book from the Wonga Park Primary School. It was great to meet with Wonga Park Primary School principal, Julie, and St Andrews Primary School principals, Carol and Hayley. When I visited, Carol and Hayley and their students were busy serving and hosting the senior's festival high tea, an example of how our schools connect with the wider community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And recently, I had the opportunity to celebrate the Christmas Hills Primary School and the Woori Yallock Primary School 150th birthdays celebrations. They were a great testament to those communities and what they've given to our community. Christmas Hills, in particular, is special. It was the school that my mum spent over a decade teaching at. It's a small school. It's a great school. That's why we've got to continue to back education outcomes in Victoria and across the country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Corangamite for this motion, which provides an opportunity to present a vision for an education system in Australia that is equitable and accessible for all students regardless of their backgrounds. The Albanese Labor government is committed to transforming education, ensuring every child has the opportunity to succeed. Our dedication is evident. Through an unprecedented pledge of $16 billion in additional funding for public schools, this funding aims to bring every school to 100 per cent of its fair funding level via the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement. By collaborating with states and territories, we can ensure that all students receive the necessary support to thrive. As emphasised by our Minister for Education, funding is critical but so is what it is spent on. This agreement will link funding to reforms that enhance student outcomes and ensure that every dollar has a significant impact. Unlike others, who might prefer a blank-cheque approach, we are focused on funding the most disadvantaged schools first and turn that funding into effective reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this funding, we are investing over $284 million in school infrastructure through the Schools Upgrade Fund, which will create an improved learning environment necessary for students' success. In 2024, Commonwealth funding for education will increase from $27.8 billion to $29.2 billion, reflecting our commitment to quality education for all students. Currently, we are negotiating the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement with states and territories. This agreement represents a crucial opportunity to tie Commonwealth funding to meaningful reforms. Minister Clare has highlighted consistently that nearly all new jobs will require students who complete school and pursue further education. Therefore, it is essential that we support students from diverse backgrounds and help them stay engaged in their education. We are focused on prioritising funding for the most disadvantaged schools first, ensuring that reforms help students catch up, keep up and complete their education. This agreement emphasises three key areas: equity and excellence; wellbeing for learning and engagement; and a strong sustainable workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A significant challenge facing our education system is the ongoing teacher shortages. The Albanese Labor government has also launched the National Teacher Workforce Action Plan, which includes a comprehensive strategy. This will ensure every student can fulfil their potential benefits by linking funding to reform and effectively addressing teacher shortages. We are making strides towards achieving 100 per cent fair funding for every school. Notably, the Western Australia, Northern Territory and Tasmania governments have signed the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement to allow them to reach this goal. For Western Australia alone, this entails an additional $777.4 million in public school funding from 2025-2029, ensuring full funding for disadvantaged schools by 2026. Additionally, we are allocating $203.7 million to the Student Wellbeing Boost, which supports students' wellbeing across all schools in Australia. This initiative underscores our commitment not only to academic success but also to creating environments where students feel safe and supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's legacy in education has been marked by widening gaps and declining outcomes. The Productivity Commission reported that, under their governance, disadvantaged students were three times more likely to fall behind academically. Attendance rates dropped, high school completion rates declined, teacher shortages worsened, and disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged students grew significantly, and that's highlighted by their having only one speaker this morning on this motion. Our vision is clear: through collaboration and commitment to these reforms, including addressing teacher shortages, we can create an education system that is equitable for every student.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, let us remember that the success of our students directly impacts the future of our nation. As a board member of eight schools in my electorate of Pearce, I understand that investing in education and ensuring we have quality teachers is crucial for fostering a brighter future for Australians. I thank all the teaching staff and teacher aides out in the communities. Together we can provide every student with the opportunity to reach their full potential and contribute meaningfully to our country's growth and its development.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I thank my good friend, the effervescence and ever-industrious member for Corangamite, for moving this motion, as it gives me the opportunity to reflect on the Albanese Labor government's commitment to and action on education. As a former high school teacher, education is a subject that is close to my heart. I'm looking forward to speaking in support of the Better and Fairer Schools (Funding and Reform) Bill this week. Education is the great transformational opportunity. Education has been a key priority for this government since the end of the antediluvian times, back in May 2022. Our reform focus has encompassed the whole spectrum from boosting support in the early childhood sector through to enabling greater access to postschool education—from ABCs through to PhDs and everything in between.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This focus was certainly needed when Labor came into government. After nearly a decade of coalition government, the sector was neglected, underfunded and underloved. Young Australians paid the price, with the Productivity Commission finding that the equity gap widened under the coalition's school agreement. To translate what that means, the LNP were white-anting our egalitarian society. This same schools agreement, the National School Reform Agreement, did not enable any public schools outside of the ACT to reach their set Schooling Resource Standard, thus ignoring the economic and social benefits that Gonski said would flow from such investment. The former government's flippant disregard for the Gonski recommendations from 2011 meant that public schools across the country were underfunded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, the Schooling Resource Standard is an estimate of the level of government funding that a school needs to meet the educational requirements of its students. Remember, all students take baggage from their parents and homes to school. Some is nice baggage, some is horrible baggage, but all students carry some of their home environment through the school gate each day. Under the coalition, students from disadvantaged backgrounds were found to be three times more likely to fall behind. Over 85,000 students did not meet basic literacy or numeracy standards. As a nation that values learning, this is a shameful record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can trust a Labor government to take action on inequity, and that is at the heart of the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement. It will replace the ineffective and damaging National School Reform Agreement at the end of this year and will run until the end of 2034. It will invest $16 billion to meet Gonski targets and to ensure fair school funding. That means every school will be achieving 100 per cent of its fair funding level. Under this agreement, the Commonwealth will contribute half of that five per cent gap in SRS—the biggest ever increase in funding to public schools—with the states and territories also contributing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, as their  name suggests, state schools are run by states. The Minister for Education, Jason Clare, has already negotiated deals with WA, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. This means that schools in WA and Tasmania will be fully funded from 2026 and that those in the Northern Territory will be fully funded by 2029. This is ahead of the plan by two decades and is entirely necessary to provide equity for children who are experiencing disadvantage. Minister Clare has said that this funding is not a blank cheque. Crucially, it's tied to outcomes-focused reforms. We want the community to have full transparency about how their taxpayer dollars are changing young lives. This means measures such as early assessment, in year 1, of phonics and numeracy to identify children who need additional support before they get left behind. As a high school teacher, I can say that I definitely believe that 'a stitch in time saves nine' when it comes to kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Better and Fairer Schools Agreement is also focused on shoring up a strong and sustainable workforce. One of the first actions taken by Minister Clare was the development of the National Teacher Workforce Action Plan. Even in Moreton, an inner-city seat, some of my schools still have trouble tracking down teachers. This plan recognises five priority areas: increasing the number of teachers, strengthening teacher education at universities, retaining current teachers, elevating the profession to the respected and valued status it deserves, and mapping out future workforce requirements. This has translated into 4,000 additional university places for starting a teaching degree and $56 million for Commonwealth teaching scholarships designed to attract enthusiastic and committed students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I went to my good friend John Carozza's 60th birthday party. We met on my first day at teachers college back in 1983. The table was full of teachers: John, Brendan, Fiona, Craig, Kylie, Rex, Liz. We were all talking about a lifetime of teaching. John Carozza is an exceptional teacher at QACI in Kelvin Grove. We were talking about what we need to do to retain teachers and also inspire students at schools to go into a teaching career—a strong, noble career. It is something that my youngest son has committed to doing, and I hope he fares well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  In my first speech to parliament, I made it clear to those who had elected me and to those who were in the room that I wanted to be part of a government that would help fix the imbalance in school funding. My ask was pretty simple. I want public school kids to have the same education and resources as those who attend independent schools. Today we know that the scales have been tipped heavily in the wrong direction. For far too long public schools in Australia have been underfunded, and in New South Wales the gap in the Schooling Resource Standard has persisted. This gap doesn't exist as regularly for independent schools, and it has meant that students' access to quality education isn't the same. The imbalance we have, made worse by nearly a decade under the Liberals, has meant that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are three times more likely to fall behind, with 86,000 students across the country not meeting basic literacy or numeracy standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To address this gap, Labor has put $16 billion on the table over the next decade, committing to cover half of the SRS funding gap. This $16 billion represents the largest increase in Commonwealth funding to public schools in Australian history, ensuring that all students, no matter their background, have access to high-quality public education. Our ask is pretty reasonable. The states, who are responsible for the delivery of public education, can fund half, and the federal government will step up and fund the other half. For the first time, our federal investment is tied to real, measurable outcomes focused on improving student performance, enhancing student wellbeing and creating a strong and sustainable teaching workforce. The Better and Fairer Schools Agreement reflects this commitment to reform and sets out to close the educational equity gaps that have held back so many public school kids for so long. As we know, education opens doors, and these reforms will ensure that every student, regardless of their background, has a foundation to build a successful future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because learning doesn't just happen in a vacuum, in today's world supporting students' wellbeing is also crucial. The pandemic brought new challenges, and we've seen a rise in mental health issues among young students. That's why Labor has invested over $200 million in student wellbeing through the Student Wellbeing Boost. This funding allows every school across the country to support student mental health better with the flexibility to address the specific needs of their school communities. Schools have used this funding to bring in mental health professionals, run wellbeing programs and create activities that foster a sense of belonging and engagement. Our approach to wellbeing ensures that no student's mental health is overlooked. We know that, when students are emotionally supported, they're more prepared to engage academically. This investment in student wellbeing is a direct response to the mental health challenges young Australians face today, making sure they have the support at school that they need to thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong education system also requires a strong workforce. Unfortunately Australia has been facing a teacher shortage, an issue that has been growing over the past 10 years. Our government is addressing this challenge head-on through the National Teacher Workforce Action Plan. It includes a $159 million investment for 4,000 additional university places in education, a $30 million teacher workload reduction fund and $56 million in scholarships designed to attract passionate individuals to the profession. These initiatives are creating a stronger and more sustainable workforce. We're focused not only on attracting new teachers but also on supporting those already in the classroom. This plan provides teachers with high-quality professional learning, eases their workload and equips them with the tools they need to succeed in the classroom. Retaining experienced teachers and encouraging new ones to the field are essential to our strong education system, and our plan is crucial to achieving that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to education also includes the very environments in which they learn, with $285 million allocated through the Schools Upgrade Fund to invest in critical school infrastructure. In Bennelong, schools like Eastwood Heights Public School, Ryde Public School and West Ryde Public School have received upgrades to outdoor learning spaces, shade structures and more, creating comfortable, safe environments for students to learn and grow. On this side we want our public schools to be the best they can be. What we've delivered plus our record funding arrangements on the table show that federal Labor is serious about addressing the funding imbalance in public schools in Bennelong and right across the country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to move this motion standing up for our farmers and the critically important work that they do to provide food security to our nation and to feed the growing global population, now exceeding eight billion people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paragraph 4 of this motion points to current comparable regulatory practice and evidence that there is no link between paraquat, diquat and other herbicides and the risk of illnesses such as Parkinson's disease. Even so, nobody should interpret this motion as rejecting what the science may show or prove in the future. I fully empathise with those that suffer neurological conditions. They are debilitating and horrific, and in this motion I do not wish to diminish their suffering or the cause of their illness. Today's motion is about the practice and science today, not what might once have been.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paragraph 2 of this motion takes issue with the sensationalism of the ABC portrayed on <span style="font-style:italic;">Landline</span>, a program that farmers have trusted for generations. Their suggestion is that historical practices are still occurring today. Children are not being exposed to herbicides in the way the ABC's recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Landline</span> program suggested, and farmers now apply herbicides in protected environments that are safe, with virtually no exposure to the chemicals. The fact that the APVMA took the rare step of responding to <span style="font-style:italic;">Landline</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span> misrepresentations of the reality of this topic demonstrates the severity of that misinformation spread by the public broadcaster. I commend the APVMA for correcting the record.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make clear that the coalition supports the independence and evidence based approach to policy at the APVMA. This motion, in paragraph (2)(b), makes that abundantly clear: trust the science. Don't trust sensationalist and frankly disappointing reporting or vested interests pushing for an outcome. We trust the APVMA to come to the right conclusion, but the misinformation being spread about modern paraquat and diquat practices must be countered in this place, lest the decision-makers labour under the misapprehension that nobody here takes issue with claims that grow close to slandering our farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Naturally, the Nationals are quick to their feet when our farmers are potentially slandered. My Nationals colleagues who are speaking on this motion and I represent electorates with farmers who rely on paraquat and diquat to operate in both an environmentally friendly and financially viable way. That's the irony of what has been proposed by would-be environmentalists in this debate. By seeking to reduce herbicide usage, activists risk farmers being forced to one or two unpalatable outcomes. Firstly, they may have to revert to heavy tillage farming. Secondly, in the alternative, they may have to cease farming, and then who will maintain the land and prevent the prevalence of weeds or other pests on those properties? One might also ask: who is going to feed the nation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current usage rate of paraquat is around 1,200 to 1,800 millilitres to the hectare. But, as my constituent Ron Hards from Werrimull told me, if the rate is reduced to, say, 400 millilitres to the hectare: 'You may as well pee in the corner of the paddock. It does nothing.' Worse still, as Ron points out, at low dosages, policymakers will effectively be promoting weed resistance to herbicides. Paraquat and diquat have been used safely for 30 years and are presently used to knock down weeds, weakened first with the application of Roundup herbicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without paraquat and diquat, my hometown of Mildura will once again be blanketed in dust storms. Even those Labor and Teal MPs might want to explain to their voters why they would want dust storms over Sydney again. That's what will happen if farmers are forced to stay viable by returning to heavy tillage farming if paraquat and diquat are removed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Grain Producers Australia and Mallee constituents like Andrew Weidemann and Ron Hards, and a great many more who have spoken with me privately, who've been gathering the evidence, gravely concerned about the ABC's misrepresentation of the reality of grain producing farming and deeply concerned that activists will yet again have another win which will mean severe loss for Australian farmers. Make no mistake: an unworkable APVMA ruling will sit at Labor's feet.</span>

                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  As the member for Tasmania's largest rural electorate, I take a keen interest in the matters the member for Mallee has brought forward today. Before any agricultural and veterinary products can be sold or used in Australia, they are evaluated and registered by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, APVMA, an independent regulatory body responsible for ensuring the safety, efficacy and environmental impact of such products—including paraquat and diquat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paraquat and diquat are widely used herbicides in grain and horticulture farming. The APVMA recently reviewed paraquat and has proposed removing support for certain high-rate uses, due to its potential as an environmental risk and insufficient mitigation of acute poisoning risks. The APVMA's proposed decision released on 30 July sets out which uses of paraquat can remain acceptable—specifically, at lower rates and early in the season. These proposed restrictions align with best practice to protect our environment and, importantly, our users, who, of course, are our farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The APVMA examined a wide range of epidemiological studies, including concerns about paraquat's potential link to Parkinson's disease, which of course was the subject of the ABC report that the member for Mallee refers to. After thorough evaluation, both the APVMA and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have found no robust association between paraquat exposure and Parkinson's, reassuring the public that these findings are grounded in scientific evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that the APVMA operates as an independent body. Its decisions are based on evidence. Government officials and elected representatives cannot and should not seek to influence such regulatory decisions, which are founded in science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're speaking about the APVMA, I'm going to take the opportunity to highlight some of the systemic challenges that it has faced as an organisation in recent years. A 2023 review found that some chemical reviews by the organisation had taken decades to resolve. The roots of those delays can be traced back to the decisions of the former Liberal-National government. Of course there was also the forced move of APVMA in 2016 to the city of Armidale in the electorate of New England, the seat of the then agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. This move significantly disrupted APVMA's operations and led to severe staffing upheaval, including a shortage of technical experts, and a decline in regulatory efficiency and quality, as highlighted in both the 2019 Independent Review of the Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Regulatory System in Australia and the 2023 review. Despite these findings, the former government failed to act. It sat on critical reports, allowing inefficiencies and staffing shortages to persist. The combination of the upheaval of the forced relocation and the delayed response to the impacts smashed the APVMA's ability to fulfil its purpose. It has been left to the Albanese government to pick up the pieces and fix the mess left behind by a decade of Liberal and National incompetence and neglect, and that's a familiar refrain across so many portfolios.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April, the Albanese government outlined our preliminary response to the rapid evaluation of the APVMA, detailing the reforms necessary to restore confidence in this essential regulator. A critical step was the appointment of Scott Hansen as new board chair and CEO in July, installing the experienced leadership needed to make the APVMA a world-class chemical regulator. We have removed the requirement for APVMA staff to be based at Armidale, allowing the organisation to recruit based on expertise rather than geography. This change improves operational efficiency and enhances the agency's ability to fulfil its regulatory responsibilities. And let's be clear. For the record, the APVMA's role is to regulate the sector across all of Australia, not to shore up a local jobs message for the member for New England in a city in his electorate. Throughout the reform process, the APVMA will continue to exercise its regulatory powers to address outstanding chemical reviews and will keep the minister informed with regular updates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mallee had a bit of a sledge at the ABC. I reject that entirely. I don't agree with everything the ABC does, but I respect its right to act independently and make its own editorial judgements.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  My late father, Lance, left school after his primary school years and went straight to the farm. I can remember, when I came along and Dad took me up to the paddock, we used to pour chemicals and liquids into water in the boom sprayer and then make sure we did everything we could to get the highest yield. He probably didn't take all the necessary measures, because they weren't in place at the time and he just didn't know what he didn't know. Of course, these days farming is a lot different. Farmers kit up properly when mixing chemicals. They do everything they can to place safety first. My father placed safety first too, but times were different. Times were way different. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly didn't get the yields then that we are getting now. We are getting the yields now from grain because of the wonderful steps we've taken in technology and science, and we thank the universities and we thank our farmers for what they have done to increase production. And we should thank our farmers three times a day every day. Every time we tuck our knees under the table to eat, we should be applauding and lauding our farmers' work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers are the best in the world. They're the best environmentalists in the world. What they don't need is more regulation. What they don't need is somebody coming down on top of them and telling them that they've got to dilute this and got to dilute that, because what will happen, if we go down the path that some are suggesting, is that we will make the weeds resistant to the various chemicals we spray on them—substances we use to gain higher yields—and we can't have that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very good motion, and it wouldn't be brought forward by no less than the shadow assistant minister for regional health if it weren't a good cause. Paraquat and diquat have been used safely for more than three decades. They're presently used to knock down weeds which have been weakened first with an application of Roundup herbicide. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the ABC has gone out on a limb on this. Sometimes we see our national broadcaster do this sort of thing in this sort of way and then use <span style="font-style:italic;">Country Hour</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Landline</span> to push it and promote it. But even the member for Lyons just said that, as it stands, based on current evidence, there is no link—no link whatsoever—between paraquat and Parkinson's disease, but there is an obligation to listen to the science if such evidence presents itself. There is. The member for Mallee understands that. She grasps it. She has a history of making sure that the people she represents come first, and this is why she has brought this important motion to the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that farmers adhere to the safety precautions when using any herbicides. My father did in his own way. I know the member for Parkes, a farmer of many decades experience, also does. When used within these guidelines, any risks associated are reduced. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry must listen to all farmers on this issue, not just those from perhaps a show or a radio program broadcast by the ABC. We saw what happened last time Labor did this, with live cattle. In a knee-jerk response to a program in June 2011—I remember it well—we just cut the cattle trade. We didn't tell Indonesia at the time; they found out later. But we cut the cattle trade. It was the worst decision in agriculture—the worst decision up until they decided to stop live sheep exports.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an attack on farmers. Make no mistake; it always is. It's an attack on those people who produce the finest food and the best fibre in all of the world. These decisions need to be made holistically, taking in the evidence from farmers and, most importantly, the science, and weighing up the risks and benefits to primary producers and how it would affect the production of the top-quality food and fibre I mentioned for which, as I also mentioned, Australia is renowned. The APVMA—the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority—is reviewing the approved usage levels of paraquat and diquat in Australia, and that is imminently and perfectly sensible. Let's leave it to the experts. Let's not leave it to the ABC, let's not leave it to Labor trying to score political points. Let's leave it to the experts. Let's make sure we put every provision in place for our farmers to increase their yields, to do what they've always done in the best possible way and to not rush to stupid, knee-jerk, meaningless responses, the only benefit of which and the only winners of which will be our weeds.</span>

I commend their stance, but it is a little bit surprising given the record of the coalition when it comes to this independent arm's-length regulator.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, was established in 1993 to centralise the registration of all agricultural and veterinary chemical products in the Australian marketplace. The chemical registration process rests on a rigorous scientific evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a chemical to protect the health and safety of people, animals, the environment and trading relationships—scientists serving the nation, scientists saving lives, scientists doing science. Billy Hughes was still a Labor PM when he set up the precursor to the CSIRO way back in 1916. He did go on to serve five other parties, but, I note, never the National Party. The Labor Party has always had that strong connection with the bush and with science. We believe that it's vital to value and uphold the role of all independent agencies, especially scientific ones.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't want politicians making scientific decisions. This means letting them get on with their job of interpreting the science without undue influence and then listening to their expert findings. The APVMA is no different, and the Albanese government is taking steps to bolster confidence in it after years of some, frankly, quite bizarre interference under the coalition government. First, there was the ill-thought-out and ill-planned move of the APVMA to Armadale in the electorate of New England. This measure was designed and implemented by the member for New England for his own bizarre personal reasons. First, he ordered a cost-benefit analysis of the move. Then he decided to ignore that process. He did not wait for the report or consult industry, and then he moved the APVMA anyway. In fact, there was intense industry opposition to this move, led by the National Farmers Federation and CropLife. Surprise, surprise—the National Party member ignoring the farmers! Maybe because he was an accountant, I don't know. When the cost benefit analysis was finally released—</span>

When the cost-benefit analysis was finally released it warned that the move could delay investigation and approval processes, adversely affecting the industry. It also cautioned against the loss of regulatory scientists—the experts responsible for the critical work—foreshadowing how this would affect the ability of the agency to meet its KPIs. By May 2023 the staffing crisis within the agency was actually raised in estimates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not like the former government did not know there were problems. The former agriculture minister commissioned a report into the regulatory system in September 2019 and then sat on the report for a year without taking any action. It has taken a Labor government to step in and resolve these issues. Labor is helping the bush because we govern without fear or favour. We appointed a new board chair and CEO to provide the leadership required to revitalise and reform the APVMA so it could continue to serve farmers like the honourable member opposite. We also removed the requirement that staff be Armadale-based: therefore, attracting high-quality candidates from further afield and not just because their postcode happened to be 2530, smack bang in the middle of the New England electorate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2023 Clayton Utz review of the APVMA noted that some reviews for chemicals were subject to decades of delay. In response, the minister for agriculture issued a ministerial direction to resolve outstanding reviews, and significant progress has been made. Letting the APVMA get on with its job is precisely what this Labor government is doing when it comes to the herbicides paraquat and diquat.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These chemicals are used to manage weeds in grain and other horticultural farming and have been under review by the APVMA. As a result, the APVMA proposes to apply some limitations to their use, including at high rates of applications that pose an unacceptable level of risk to the environment—and the people around that environment, obviously—and when the poisoning risk is not adequately mitigated. The proposed regulatory decision was released on 30 July this year and still allows usage at lower rates and early in the season. Public consultation ended on 29 October. This proposal has received support from the interim CEO of Grain Producers Australia, who agrees with the measures to tighten rules against their safe handling.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak with practical experience in the use of paraquat. In my previous role as a grain farmer, we would use that in what's known as a double knock. The glyphosate would take out a lot of the weeds. The harder to kill ones would need another application, this time of paraquat, to finish them up.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">People would go, 'Oh, you're using chemicals.' The reason that at the moment, as we speak, right across western New South Wales we have the biggest wheat crops on record ever harvested is the technique of growing wheat in western New South Wales, and that's using no till, zero till. We're not ploughing or cultivating; we're just preserving the trash from the previous crop on top of the ground. It reflects the light and the heat, and it conserves the moisture. We hear a lot of talk in this place about carbon farming and funky phrases about what's all the go. The farmers in my electorate have been doing this for decades. They pioneered this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC didn't just play this once. I must be in the car—I think it was last week—driving around my electorate, and I heard the first report on this, with the same gentleman quoted, between six and 6.30 in the morning. Then, it was on between 12 and 1, and it was on the afternoon show, at about four in the afternoon. So three times in the one day they read this. I've got great sympathy for the gentleman they reviewed, who has Parkinson's and who believes the use of this chemical might have led to it. But he also said he was soaked in this chemical. Look, if you soaked yourself every day in petrol, you probably wouldn't be all that healthy, but we're not banning petrol. If mechanics tipped battery acid over their heads while installing batteries into cars, it probably would do them much good either, but we're not banning battery. This is the same. When I used paraquat, I wore rubber gloves and a long-sleeved shirt. It was towed by a tractor with a carbon filtered cab—everything as per the recommendation. If you follow those recommendations, it is a safe chemical to use. It's an essential one. We need to make sure we don't have these knee-jerk reactions from people on the fringes of things that tend to want to do things to make others change what they're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a lot of defence for the APVMA and a lot of discussion about their history. I can say the APVMA can lift their act. This is not the only issue that has been bubbling along for some time. For the last 12 months or so, I've been talking with some farmers and suppliers in my electorate about a seed treatment called Victrato. The significant trials of Victrato that have been done by Syngenta with the local firm McGregor Gourlay over five years have shown considerable improvement in yield potential by controlling crown rot. Crown rot is a very, very insidious issue with wheat, which remains largely unknown until the crops mature, and then the yield just falls away. They have been waiting for an outcome from the APVMA, hoping that this year they could use Victrato, but that's not happening. They thought next year, in the 2025 season, but it looks like that has been pushed out because the APVMA are concerned about the lack of efficacy, not about potential environmental impacts. My point is: why not let the market decide whether this chemical works or not? If it won't have any ill effects and it's only about the efficacy, that's an issue that should be dealt with. The APVMA does have an issue of dragging its feet in places where it's not necessary. I'm not saying we take shortcuts. I'm not saying that chemicals shouldn't be properly scrutinised. But there is no need to drag things out unnecessarily when it's affecting the viability and potential profitability of farmers in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  Governments have a duty to protect farmers and the agricultural sector, and not just economically, given the value Australian farming has to local communities and the wider nation—I will touch on that later—but physically. Like all Australian workers, farmers on the land must work in the safest possible conditions. This is something a Labor government will never shy away from, and it should be an objective for those opposite who are in large part representatives of more regional and agriculture-centric communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would expect members of the opposition to agree with me on this subject. I would also expect those members, such as the member for Mallee, to acknowledge that, when new evidence is found regarding the impact of certain chemicals, it is taken into consideration constructively, then scrutinised and finally actioned accordingly by regulatory bodies. In the motion, the member for Mallee at least touches on the important role these authorities play for our nation. In this case, it's the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, and rightly so. This body performs critical work to ensure the chemicals used by our farmers—those employed each and every day to help ensure food continues to end up on Australian tables—are safe to use. Whether that's by mandating certain practices with chemical substances or by introducing restrictions on a product's use, these efforts go a long way toward limiting potential health risks within Australian culture. The significance of this role can't be understating. It's important that public faith, both inside the agricultural sector and beyond, is maintained by the APVMA so that it can continue to make these important decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that faith was undermined under the watch of those opposite—so much so that it led to a strategic review of the body. That review recommended significant changes. Once again, it's up to this Labor government to clean up nearly a decade of neglect under the previous Liberal administration. Under that old government, a report to review the regulatory framework behind agvet chemicals, which include paraquat and diquat, was first authorised. What was the outcome of this review, I hear you ask? Well, it was nothing, because those opposite chose to sit on that report for over a year without taking any action on its recommendations. The opposition must appreciate the work the Labor government are doing, having chosen during its administration to leave so much work for our government to tidy up later. It's flattering if not a little disappointing, but I digress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's imperative that confidence be restored in the APVMA, and we're getting on with that task, having taken important steps towards its reform. Likewise, the APVMA is getting on with its role, too, having recently proposed additional regulatory action on the use of paraquat and diquat. That regulation was open for public consultation and submissions until last week. Submitted as part of that consultation are the views of neurologists and other doctors who believe there is a link between these chemicals and the development of Parkinson's disease. Regardless of our thoughts on them as legislators, taking in views such as these represents a core process of the APVMA, especially as they're an independent agency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The body is also, as the member for Mallee's motion seeks to promote, listening to the voices of farmers across the country, who are having their say on that submission process as well. This is happening as I speak, and it's something I'd expect the member for Mallee to appreciate, given her motion. But, unfortunately, the honourable member doesn't see it that way, having come to her own scientific conclusions, refusing to let the APVMA do the work required and dismissing other points of view as sensationalist. The member is choosing to weaponise media reports that she disagrees with. It's a shame, because using a regulatory process solely to attack the ABC does nothing to help farmers waiting for the final decision on the proposed changes. It certainly doesn't display a willingness to listen to science, either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Processes like these allow for scrutiny, research and analysis from both public and academic levels, enabling us to make informed decisions to protect Aussies' wellbeing. With a motion like this, the member for Mallee goes around that process and applies her own ideas, away from that scrutiny. This is worrying behaviour. Worse still, it has been embraced wholeheartedly by the opposition. I would urge the member for Mallee and her colleagues, who continue to apply forms of antiscience like this, to consider the impact of their actions and change course.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I rise today to talk about wages growth and the first act of the Albanese Labor government, the Jobs and Skills Summit, because this government has spent the last two years following through on the findings of that summit and what drove that summit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The summit's focal topics included keeping unemployment low, boosting productivity and raising incomes; delivering secure, well-paid jobs and strong, sustainable wages growth; expanding employment opportunities for all Australians, including the most disadvantaged; addressing skills shortages and getting our skills mix right over the long term; maximising jobs and opportunities from renewable energy, tackling climate change, the digital economy, the care economy and a Future Made in Australia; and ensuring women have equal opportunities and equal pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2022 the member for Hawke and I had our own outer western suburbs jobs and skills summit. Our local summit helped to inform the national Jobs and Skills Summit in Canberra on 1 and 2 September 2022. At both summits, we heard similar information. We heard that the feminised industries, particularly the care economy, were being left behind in terms of wages. We heard that the industries, including child care and aged care, that those opposite would rather we didn't mention had bargaining systems so complicated that wages were going backwards and there was understaffing and reduced productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here now, a proud member of the Albanese Labor government, knowing that we are delivering wage increases of up to 15 per cent to aged-care workers and early childhood educators and carers. Why? Because the coalition government purposely kept wages low and allowed enterprise bargaining to collapse—so much so that only 14 per cent of industries were covered by an agreement and we experienced a decade of Australians going backwards financially, with stagnant wages, particularly those in the care economy. Those things have now been addressed. Our industrial relations legislation has seen industries opened up and negotiations made easier for workers, to ensure that their wages will continue to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Jobs and Skills Summit, the government took steps to reinvigorate bargaining with our significant reforms under the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Act. These included enacting the new supported bargaining stream, which has reduced the barriers for low-paid sectors to access the benefits of bargaining; making the better off overall test simpler and fairer; and giving the Fair Work Commission more power to arbitrate and resolve intractable bargaining. Because of this government, there are now half a million more Australian workers covered by current enterprise agreements. This is boosting wages and workplace conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it bluntly, Deputy Speaker, when the Labor government say they're going to do something, they do it. As an election commitment, the Albanese government said that it would prioritise addressing the cost-of-living crisis with well-thought-out and practical measures, and that what is what we've done. In less than a full term we have successfully turned a decade of coalition government deficits into Labor surpluses. We've ensured wages growth. We have the gender pay gap down to 11 per cent, the lowest it's ever been. This is a government that I am proud to be a part of, a government committed to increasing wages, tackling inflation and ensuring that unemployment doesn't rise. There has been carefully planned and carefully implemented legislation brought to this place, one step at a time, delivering on the commitments that we made on taking government and delivering on the things that we found in the skills and employment summit.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion in relation to the Labor government's workplace relations policies, and I note that it was originally moved by the honourable member for Werriwa. The honourable member for Werriwa, of course, represents an electorate in Sydney's south. After the next election, following the Electoral Commissioner's redistributions, the suburbs of Glenfield, Bardia, Macquarie Links, Macquarie Fields and Long Point will be within my electorate of Hughes. The suburb of Ingleburn, currently within the electorate of Macarthur, will similarly be moved into Hughes. If I am re-elected, I look forward to serving and representing those constituents, as my seat will then be firmly in southern and south-west Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those in south-west Sydney, indeed for those throughout the entirety of our nation, the role the federal government plays in workplace relations is critical. It is critical for those working in manufacturing, in retail trades and in construction. These are sectors that predominate in southern and south-west Sydney. There are also large numbers of small businesses within my existing electorate and within the areas that will become part of my electorate. Industrial relations policy is top of mind for our small businesses, and they are not happy with this Albanese Labor government. This is not the government of Hawke and Keating or even of Whitlam, who were committed to looking after the so-called working class. Instead this is a government that has forgotten the economic reforms of Keating and Hawke, with the wages accord, a system that ensured that wage increases were linked to productivity, giving prosperity to Australians. Despite his PhD in Keatingism, this Treasurer does not understand that, and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations understands it even less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take, for example, the manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector plays a crucial role in the Australian economy. During COVID, it contributed 6.2 per cent to the GDP. Imagine what it's doing now outside of COVID. It supports more than 862,000 jobs. The manufacturing industry in Australia is made up of nearly 104,000 businesses. Food manufacturing, for example, is the leading industry in the manufacturing industry, with 18 companies in the top 100 manufacturing companies. The total output of the manufacturing industry for Australia in 2020 was $319 billion. However, this is an industry that has been largely ignored by the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I met with the Southern Strength Agile Manufacturing Network. This is a group of manufacturers that are working together to ensure the long-term viability of the manufacturing sector. They spoke to me of the workplace shortages throughout the sector, especially in the trades: boilermakers, fitters and turners, welders, toolmakers, structural steel workers, packers, metal fitters and machinists, maintenance technicians and of course electricians, plumbers and pipefitters. Where is Labor's plan to address the shortage of manufacturing workers? The Labor government's workplace relations legislation does nothing to address the critical trades shortage that Australia currently has and that is on a trajectory to become a national crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we turn to the retail trades. Throughout my electorate, as a result of many factors, including the cost-of-living crisis brought on by this government, we have many vacant shopfronts. For the first time in my memory, we have spaces vacant in suburbs like Sutherland and Engadine for months on end. In Sutherland in the last two years I have been in parliament, two of the three beautiful local homewares and gift stores have had to close. My Little Dream Co. at Sutherland remains a beautiful independent retailer with the most wonderful children's books, clothes and toys. However, she is now the sole trader in that space. The retail trades have been savaged by the Labor government's policies, including workplace relations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we go to the construction industry. The National Electrical and Communications Association has spoken about the chronic shortage of trades within this sector and the chronic shortage of electricians—we need at least another 85,000 by the end of 2050. This government has no plan on workplace relations to address the critical shortages that our country is facing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  I have been pleasantly surprised to see the growing confidence in both the aged-care and childcare industries in my electorate of Gilmore following wage increases in both sectors. Whether it's caring for our youngest citizens or our oldest, the Albanese government is supporting those who play a vital role in our community with a much-deserved pay increase. I have visited many childcare centres in my electorate over the past few months, and the management, staff and families were thrilled about this government's decision to fund a 15 per cent increase for early childhood educators. Not only has it provided a boost for existing employees; this pay rise has made the childcare sector more attractive for school leavers and those seeking work in an industry that is shaping the next generation of Australians. Since the announcements, I've started seeing new childcare centres popping up in my electorate, which is fabulous because many families struggle to secure a place for their children. In Gilmore, we need more childcare providers, and this pay rise means more staff, more job security, more centres and ultimately more places for our little people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ECTARC Clipper Road Early Education and Care Service in East Nowra welcomed the pay rise, with the CEO Anita Kumar explaining how difficult it had been to attract and retain staff in an often challenging environment. The majority of the young children in care at Clipper Road are from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the wonderful staff are exhausted by the end of the day. Anita said the pay increase was well deserved by her passionate team and she is confident it will help attract additional staff, which means the centre can stay open longer, therefore helping local families in need. It was also great to see Little Zak's Academy recently open its doors in Bomaderry, with a second centre soon to open in Kiama. New childcare centres are also on the drawing board for Ulladulla, Sussex Inlet, North Nowra and central Nowra, which is just fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm seeing a similar scenario playing out in aged care. In the electorate with the second-highest number of aged-care pensioners in the country, aged-care workers are in demand. The Albanese government's investment of $3.8 billion over four years to support the aged-care sector has given providers more confidence. The 15 per cent wage increase for aged-care workers makes this important industry more attractive for workers needing the financial security to buy their own homes. Funding pay rises for aged-care workers of up to 28 per cent for workers from 1 January 2025 will facilitate the delivery of a higher standard of care for older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's workplace reforms are delivering secure jobs and better pay, which is providing cost-of-living relief. In the two years until May 2024, average weekly earnings have increased by $153.60 per week, compared to only $55.90 per week over the two years prior to May 2022, when the coalition was in office. In the June 2024 quarter, I'm pleased to say we've seen a wage price index growth of 4.1 per cent, the second-largest annual growth rate since December 2009. The WPI has been equal to or above four per cent for the last four quarters, which has not occurred since Labor was last in government. Under the Albanese government in the year to June 2024, we've seen the highest wage increases in the healthcare and social assistance sectors, education and training industry, and electricity gas, water and waste services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, we have seen strong nominal wage growth and weakening inflation, which has resulted in real wage growth returning, thanks to our workplace relations reforms and responsible economic management. We have gone in to bat for low-paid workers with a national minimum wage increase three times in three years. That's an extra $103.30 per week in the pockets of full-time employees. We have advocated for wage increases and have taken steps to reinvigorate bargaining with our significant reforms under the secure jobs, better pay act. These changes mean that almost half a million more workers are now covered by current enterprise agreements, improving conditions and delivering real wage rises.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is also supporting women to earn more, and I'm thrilled that in September the female participation rate was at a record high of 63.2 per cent. It's also great news that the gender pay gap is now the lowest on record.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  It's been interesting listening to this debate, because I thought it was about real wages, but I haven't heard much about real wages. I've heard about gross wages but not real wages. When I'm out in my community talking to people, most of them talk about net wages. I can remember as a young bloke getting my first pay, which was in a little yellow envelope, a mustard colour—we can all remember those ugly things—and it had 'gross pay $104, tax $14, net pay $90'. You ripped it open, you tipped it out and you had some cash, and it was great. All we cared about was what we got in our hand. We couldn't a toss about what it was before tax; all we cared about was what we were getting in our mitts. But real wages, of course, go another step, because real wages are about what you get for your money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember talking to a young person a couple of months ago about how tough the cost of living was on their family. I said, 'What do you think the solution is?' and they said, 'Maybe they should put wages up.' I said, 'Yes, they could do that. Let's work it out.' Let's say someone's on 50 grand a year, and we gave them another 50 bucks a week. They'll lose $16 of that in tax. The person who's picking the strawberries at the farm gets the same pay rise. The person who's driving them in a truck to the depot gets the same pay rise. The forklift driver gets the same pay rise. Then it gets delivered to Woolies, and the person unloading it gets the same pay rise. The person putting it on the shelf gets it. All those extra gross wages have to be paid for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you've got two choices when you're in business. If your gross wages bill goes up, either you've got to put your prices up or you've got to cut your wage bill. It's pretty simple. The thing about it is that most people who are in business can't afford to put their wages up, because of competition. So what happens is they start to lay people off. That doesn't sound like a win. That doesn't sound like a party that cares about workers. So I would contend this: what's the point of getting a pay rise of $50, paying $16 in tax, being $34 better off, when your grocery bill and your cost of living go up $70 a week? That's a net loss of $36. That's a complete waste of time. There are no winners in this whole story. Forget the spin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember talking to my son. He came to me when he was in his early 20s and he said, 'Dad, I don't understand politics and I don't care about it, but I'm trying to figure out who I should vote for.' Trying to be pragmatic and fair, I said, 'Son, you should probably go and look at all the different parties and see what they stand for and vote for what you believe in.' He said, 'I don't care about any of that stuff, Dad. It's just for old blokes like you.' I think at the time I was about 43! He said, 'All I know is that I seem to have more money in my pocket when the Libs are in, so I'm going to vote for them.' I said, 'That sounds like as good a reason as any, son,' because that is the stark reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can spin this however you like. You can talk about higher wages. We all want more people to earn more; of course we do. But at what cost? 'At what cost?' I ask the government. For goodness sake, are we going to keep putting wages up? We are in a global market, and we are becoming more and more uncompetitive. That's why it was the coalition who brought out the tax cuts—because we believe that net pay increases are what matters. It doesn't put any burden on the employer. It doesn't add costs to the goods that people are buying. Therefore, their wage increases in real terms make a difference to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way that this government's doing it, by continuously putting up gross wages, is just not helping the situation at all, and it's got to be stopped. If they understood economics, if they'd ever been in a business, they would understand that. The problem is they're trying to do it all from a textbook, and all they're doing is the headline. They'll say, 'The member for Longman doesn't want to see people get pay increases.' That's rubbish. I want to make sure that people get more and that they get more for their money. That's what I want to see. I don't want to see ridiculous headlines that just penalise people and make them go further into a hole, and that's exactly what your policies are doing. You're destroying the country. People out there are suffering. I can tell you now, when I go out and I ask the people in my community, 'Who is better off than you were three years ago?' the answer is no-one—no-one—because you're crippling this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  I rise to support this motion and congratulate the Member for moving such a good motion when it comes to real wage growth. I was listening to the previous member saying no-one's a winner when you have wage growth and increases in wages—well, the winner is the person who is getting more money in their pocket. That's what an increase in wages means; it means more money in your pocket. If you were to listen to the other side over the many years I've been here, and seen the many industrial relations policies that have been put forward—whether by the coalition or by us—with us it's about bettering the industrial relations area in terms of increasing wages and giving people the ability to earn a decent living, while on the other side it has always been about putting pressure downward, ensuring that wages remain low. We saw that for the 11 years they were in government—it was the lowest wage growth we have had in the history of this country, and every time that we spoke about increasing wages, the then coalition government opposed it. In fact, when we went in to support the increase in lower wages at the commission, they opposed it and said we shouldn't get involved in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to understand is that we have an economy, and within this economy people buy and sell. The majority of people are wage earners. Eighty per cent of Australia's population would be wage earners. They need a decent wage to be able to pay their mortgages, to put food on the table, to get kids to school and to be able to buy consumable goods. That's what keeps our economy going. If we press wages down and ensure they don't go up then the economy starts to stop. Anyone who has done 101 economics knows that once people stop buying consumable goods, the economy goes southward. It's so important to ensure that we have real wage growth, and that's what this government is doing. Since being elected, average weekly earnings have increased by 8.7 per cent, or $153.60 per week. That was two years to May 2024, compared to when the coalition left office and there was only a 3.3 per cent increase per week over the two years prior to May 2022. The wage price index growth of 4.1 per cent in the June quarter of 2024 was the second largest annual growth rate since the December quarter of 2009, which was 4.2 per cent. You can see where we were from 2009 onwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that we have decent wages and that wages keep pace with our cost of living. Four per cent for the last four quarters has not occurred since Labor was last in government. There's proof for you; when Labor is in government, real wages grow. When we're not in government, they decline and remain at a level that doesn't keep people living with decent wages and proper pay. We've also seen the lowest-paid workers in our nation—childcare workers and aged-care workers—all receive a big increase. They're all quite happy about it. The aged-care premises I go to and speak to has many, many workers, and they tell me how grateful they are for this wage increase. It's the same for childcare workers—people who do an extremely important job, educating those children at a very early age so parents can either work while they're being looked after. We can repay that by paying them a decent wage, and that also attracts more people to those industries where we need them so much. There's such a shortage at this point in those industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time I have left, I want to make sure that we are aware that over the last 10 years we had one of the lowest, slowest wage growths in the history of this country. That was because we need to put policies into place to ensure that wages keep up with the cost of living and a whole range of other things. Unfortunately, we had a government that, all those years, basically wanted to keep wages low. Some in economics argue that if you keep wages low it employs more people—that may be the case for a short time, but the reality is if people can't buy consumable goods and they can't pay for the things they require to live day-to-day then we're going backwards. We want to ensure that we go forward with government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to move a motion in recognition of our agricultural sector, a cornerstone of Australia's social, economic and environmental sustainability. Agriculture is not just an industry; it's an essential part of who we are as Australians. Our farmers work tirelessly to put food on our tables, contribute to our economy and protect our food security. In the 2023-24 financial year alone, the agricultural sector generated over $82 billion, bolstering our economy and creating jobs. In fact, this sector employs 257,000 Australians, with many working in our rural and regional communities, ensuring that over 90 per cent of our fresh produce is grown right here on Australian soil. However, our farmers are facing unprecedented challenges due to the actions of this government, which consistently disregards the needs of those who keep our food supply stable and affordable. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's decision to scrap the dedicated agriculture visa has left a gaping hole in our workforce. Industry leaders have warned of a workforce shortfall of 172,000 people, yet these calls for support have gone unanswered. Instead, Labor has chosen to rely on the Pacific Australia Labor Mobility scheme, which does not adequately meet the needs of our farmers. Our farmers need workers to keep operations running. This government has left them stranded. This isn't an issue just for farmers; it's an issue for every Australian. Without a secure workforce our farmers can't produce more, which means supply goes down and prices go up. Every Australian feels the cost of Labor's choices at the checkout.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's actions have not only undermined our workforce but also compromised Australia's water security. Water is the lifeblood of agriculture, and, by cutting over $7 billion from critical water infrastructure projects, Labor is threatening the very foundation of our farming communities. They stripped $483 million from the Urannah Dam project in Central Queensland, an initiative that would have secured water for farmers across Capricornia, yet, in blatant hypocrisy, they were quick to cut the ribbon on Rookwood Weir, a coalition funded project. This inconsistency is symbolic of a government that prioritises inner-city voices over the needs of our rural and regional communities. These reckless cuts go beyond budgetary decisions. They're an assault on the entire agriculture supply chain. Every dollar invested in water infrastructure yields enormous benefits, ensuring that our farmers can withstand droughts and changing weather conditions. By pulling this funding, Labor aren't just jeopardising the livelihoods of farmers; they're threatening the stability of rural communities and the broader Australian economy. Under this government, food prices have risen by 12 per cent, adding even more strain to Australian families, while Labor claim to support Australians struggling with the cost of living, their agricultural policies are doing the opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These policies are raising grocery bills for every household in the country, impacting everyone from families in our cities to pensioners in the bush. Our farmers bear the cost of misguided policies every day, and, in turn, so do Australian families. When Australians see their grocery bill, they should be reminded that this government is driving those prices up. Every price increase at the supermarket reflects Labor's misguided policies. Farmers aren't the only ones paying the price. The entire agriculture supply chain, the regional communities that depend on farming, and every hardworking family being hit with higher grocery bills are feeling let down by this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 September 2024, thousands of farmers gathered for the National Ag Rally on the lawns of Parliament House in Canberra. This rally was a powerful display of the sector's frustration with Labor's anti-agriculture agenda. Farmers from communities across Australia came together, united by a shared message: the Albanese government's policies are hurting those who feed our nation and drive our economy. I stand with our farmers and our agricultural communities in Capricornia and across the nation. Agriculture is not a political bargaining chip; it's the backbone of our nation. It supports families, sustains businesses and fortifies regional Australia. Our farmers have earned our respect and support. We must ensure that their needs are prioritised, not dismissed. It's time for this government to stop turning its back on agriculture and start recognising the essential role it plays in our prosperity, security and identity. Today I call on this House to acknowledge the importance of Australian agriculture and to reverse the harmful policies that are jeopardising the future of this vital industry. Let's keep farmers farming.</span>

                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  As the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, I know the work that goes on in Australian agriculture. It is a great honour to be chair of such a valuable committee in this place. It not only gives us great insight into agriculture, but we get the opportunity to meet with many farmers and many peak agricultural groups and talk through issues that are really important to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only am I proud to chair the agriculture committee, but also I married the son of a farmer, and we have maintained the friendships from his farming upbringing, over years and years. So it's not only as a politician that I get to talk to farmers. I have a lot of farming friends and they are a fantastic source of information about, really, what's going on in Australian agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect of my exposure to farmers is my electorate. I have this incredible electorate, where we have a broad base of people who still farm—not only land based farming but also fishing, and oysters, too; there's dairy and beef cattle farming. We even grow turf in my neck of the woods. I know how passionate Australian farmers are and how hard they work, not just in my fantastic electorate of Paterson but right across this broad and incredible country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the country is indeed difficult. It's been a terrific season, but we all know that we're often only a couple of months away from a dry summer that can change things. In the viticulture industry, you can be one frost away from losing everything, and that's happened too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, the gross value of agricultural production is forecast to rise by $3.7 billion to $86.2 billion in 2024-25. It's $92.1 billion if you include fisheries and forestry production. It's the third-highest result on record. So, whilst those across the aisle want to spread fear, we know that our agricultural industry is growing. The facts just don't lie. It puts us well on track to meet the industry target of $100 billion by 2030. We want to support our farmers. We want to support our entire ag sector to get to that $100 billion target by 2030, and we're on track to do it. According to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 72 per cent of our agricultural production is exported, and that's a magnificent thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, speaking from experience, we spent nearly 12 months last year doing a report on food security in Australia, and we also looked at how we help secure food for our neighbours—and this is a great thing—with our major products being sugar, beef, lamb, rice and canola, going to nations like China, Japan, Indonesia and the United States of America. We are doing a fantastic job in this country of not only feeding our own people but also helping to feed the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics prepared a report that detailed what governments should examine to resolve the tensions that have been emerging in the industry as our economy modernises and as it decarbonises. And we know that we've got very progressive farmers in Australia. They're at the cutting edge. They embrace technology like those in no other nation. They know what's going on in their industry, and they know that, in our government, they have people who want to listen and want to help them produce more food and fibre—not only, as I said, for our country but for the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working to ensure that this industry remains contemporary and vibrant and can continue to access skills. There's been a lot of commentary around labour. We opened the first jobs and skills council of agribusiness, which will work through the challenges facing the industry now and into the future. We've also invested in fee-free TAFE, which has supported over 20,000 students to gain agricultural industry skills. So we are putting the money where it needs to go in terms of agriculture. We know we need more people working in the field, and we're doing that, and that extends beyond the farm and ag sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that our grocery stores are often a place of great consternation for farmers. That's why we're putting policies in place, through the ACCC, that are looking at the mandatory code of conduct to ensure that our farmers do get a fair price—and so do consumers at Australian stores. I couldn't be prouder of the work we're doing in ag.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I am a farmer and grazier, and I'm very pleased to second this motion, moved by my colleague, the member for Capricornia, which acknowledges that agriculture is the cornerstone of Australian social, economic and environmental sustainability and that it plays an essential role in our nation's prosperity. In the 2023-24 financial year, the agricultural sector generated over $82 billion, driving Australia's economy forward. The agricultural sector employs 257,000 Australians, and over 90 per cent of the fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs available in Australia is produced locally, safeguarding our nation's food security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hardworking men and women of Central Queensland and Wide Bay have a strong history of feeding this nation. Whether it's beef from Proserpine, citrus from Mundubbera, sugar cane from Gin Gin, eggs from Mount Morgan, milk from the Boyne Valley, wheat from the central highlands or sorghum from Taroom district in Central Queensland, Wide Bay has a thriving agricultural industry. According to the Queensland government's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Queensland's contribution to the national economy in 2022-23 included 96 per cent of sugar cane, 67 per cent of grain sorghum, 33 per cent of cotton, 94 per cent of bananas, 70 per cent of macadamias, 70 per cent of sweet corn, 65 per cent of avocados, 58 per cent of lemons and limes, 53 per cent of fresh beans, 53 per cent of capsicums, 50 per cent of mandarins and mangoes and 48 per cent of the national cattle herd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion further notes that the Australian agricultural sector is facing increased pressure due to this government's destructive actions. The government's decision to scrap the dedicated agricultural visa has left the industry with severe and widespread workforce shortages. Australia's water security is being jeopardised by this federal government's reckless slashing of over $7 billion from critical water infrastructure projects. This government's misguided agricultural policies have driven food prices up by nearly 12 per cent, piling even more financial strain on everyday Australians. Central Queensland and Wide Bay have felt the brunt of antifarming policies of both state and federal Labor governments, including the introduction of vegetation and reef legislation laws that essentially took away farmers' and graziers' rights to manage their own land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2.5 years of this Labor government has felt like a lifetime for the agriculture industry of Central Queensland and Wide Bay. Labor recently proposed a biosecurity tax for Australian farmers. This levy was proposed as a way to charge Australian farmers for the biosecurity costs of importers. That is probably one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard, and that says a lot, considering that this is a proposal by the Labor government. Why would the Australian government tax their own farmers to pay for foreigners to bring products into this country? Ultimately, if the legislation had been passed, it would mean that farmers would be forced to pass on costs, which would meant families would have to spend more on fresh food produce. I'm proud of the Nationals, farmers and industry successfully, after months of campaigning, helping to scrap this tax, which was due to be implemented from 1 July 2024. Labor's fresh food tax would have hurt families at the checkout as well as 84 agricultural commodities which would have faced taxes to raise $150 million over three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, we've seen this Labor government cut vital water infrastructure funding. The decision to slash funding to restore the Paradise Dam in the North Burnett and Bundaberg region was a kick in the guts not only to the Wide Bay area but to the agricultural industry as a whole. The Bundaberg area produces 25 per cent of Australia's fresh food, and hundreds of millions of dollars of agricultural investment has been put at risk due to the Labor government's inexcusable decision to slash the funding to restore this vital piece of water infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also seeing this Labor government approve wind and solar projects at the fastest rates in Australian history, and this is to the detriment of the agricultural industry. There are countless so-called renewable projects littering and occupying prime agricultural land, and it is a simple fact that you can't eat wind turbines or solar panels. We've seen successive governments send our manufacturing overseas to countries like China. Do they want to see us all eating our fruit and vegetables from China as well? Agriculture is one of the biggest industries, if not the biggest industry, in Central Queensland and the Wide Bay, and it must be supported by both state and federal governments and not hindered, so that it can remain sustainable for generations to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I thank the member for Capricornia for raising this motion, seconded by the member for Flynn, to highlight the importance of the agricultural sector in Australia. You don't grow up the son of a butcher, the grandson of a butcher, the brother of two butchers and even the nephew of a butcher in the Balonne Shire—famous for sheep, cattle, wheat, cotton, grapes, rock melons—without a keen appreciation for farmers and graziers and the role they play in our national economy and all the prosperity that flows from that. In fact the first dollar I earned was in a shearing shed, and I also cotton chipped my way through high school and teachers college and even after, when I wanted to go backpacking around Europe. My schoolmates were the sons and daughters of cotton growers and beef cattle farmers, and I still value my connections with people working the land there today, like Ross and Paul Brimblecombe, David Moon, Peter Haslem and my very good friend Wayne Long, who's still working hard on Billy Knight's property today. We put out a book together last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical nature of the agricultural sector is also re-enforced whenever I visit the Brisbane Markets in my electorate of Moreton. They are the third largest of Australia's six central markets. Over 4,500 people work or do business there daily in Rocklea at 170 different businesses: fruit and veggie growers, wholesalers, provedores, food processors, retailers, independent supermarkets and the food service industry. It's a vital part of South-East Queensland's fresh produce supply chain, with an annual trade in excess of 700 million kilograms of produce. That's more than $2 billion worth of fruit and vegetables. There is no chance that China is going to be taking over that market any time soon, as I told the member for Flynn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that the outlook for Australia's agricultural sector is very, very positive. The gross value of agricultural production is forecast to rise by $3.7 billion to $86.2 billion in 2024-25, the third-highest result on record. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry cite research from ABARES which indicates further positive signs for both livestock farmers and crop growers. Flynn has actually been a little bit quieter since Labor came to office. Strong global demand is driving increased production values in livestock and livestock products. Beef saleyard prices are forecast to rise by 29 per cent over 2024-25 and lamb saleyard prices by 24 per cent in the same period. This growth is bolstered by increased domestic processing capability and higher export prices. Value-adding by slaughtering here is giving jobs to Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is mirrored by anticipated crop production values rising despite lower global grain and oilseed prices. In 2024-25 winter crop volumes are expected to rise by 17 per cent thanks to timely rainfall in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. I'm not saying that Labor made it rain, but many are—weather is a national responsibility! With figures like these, it is understandable that Australia consistently ranks as one of the world's most food-secure nations. We grow about 90 per cent of our own food. An ACIL Allen study highlighted the roles of diversified production, mature supply and delivery chains, and a stable society in bolstering domestic food security and maintaining a vibrant and prosperous export market. A nation of 25 million people produces enough food and fibre for 75 million people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government acknowledges the cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing at the moment. That's often felt most keenly at the checkout when we buy our fruit and veggies. Labor is committed to ensuring that Australians are paying a fair price for groceries but also that farmers are receiving what they deserve for their hard work. In terms of emissions reduction, a fair return for farmers ensures that there is no cultivation wasted. We don't leave fruit rotting on the vine or plough produce back into the fields. Labor is taking a range of measures to ease these pressures in the supermarkets sector. We've instigated a broad competition reform agenda, which includes funding for Choice to conduct quarterly price monitoring reports. That is particularly appreciated by my electorate of Moreton, who want to find out where to shop to save a few dollars. We're progressing legislation to implement the biggest change to our merger reform system in almost 50 years. We're directing an additional $30 million in funding to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to deal with dodgy practices in the supermarket sector. There is much more to be done. Get on board, National Party.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  A federal government has two main jobs. One: they keep their borders secure and their citizens safe. Two: they keep the citizens fed. This Albanese Labor government is failing at both. Agriculture is a cornerstone of Australia's success and should be one of Australia's biggest industries. If you look back through time, agriculture—the production of livestock and fresh produce—allowed millions of residents to live in cities. Think about it. If you live in the heart of Sydney or Melbourne and go to the shops, who supplies those apples, that lettuce or broccoli or that nice, juicy piece of fillet steak? That comes from a farmer. That farmer can sometimes be thousands of kilometres away from you and often has never visited your city. Every day, that farmer continues to ensure that we have fresh Australian produce on our tables. In fact, in 2023-24, the agricultural sector generated over $82 billion and employed over 250,000 Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Food security should be at the forefront of everyone's minds. Ninety per cent of the fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs available in Australia is produced locally. However, the destructive policies from the Albanese Labor government are putting this in jeopardy. The government has shut down the live sheep export, putting hundreds of businesses at risk and increasing their financial stress, all because of politics. It's not because the market ceased—no, no, no, no, no! It was purely because of some crazy idea between Labor, the Greens and the Teals. Then the government imposed a container levy that our farmers have to pay for. Can you believe that? Our farmers must pay for the biosecurity of our international competitors. I shake my head in disbelief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The price of energy is one of the biggest issues facing our farmers. Labor's reckless race to renewables is doing absolutely nothing to drive down the energy costs. Just this week, ecological experts are calling for a halt to new large-scale renewable projects. The Queensland government's former principal botanist, Jeanette Kemp, said there would be a considerable backlash if the public were fully aware of the extent of land clearing and fragmentation of valuable habitat to make way for wind farms. It's about time Australians fully learned the hypocrisy of Labor, the Greens and the Teals. They have brainwashed millions of Australians, including teachers, professors and our younger generation, claiming that they are the only ones who care about the environment. Well, it's here in black and white. They are the ones destroying it. They won't allow farmers to clear land to increase their viability—to plant, to grow—but they will allow clearing for steel structures. It's just bizarre. Life has never been easy under Prime Minister Albanese. Food prices have risen by 12 per cent. There is no water security because of Labor cuts of over $7 billion to critical water projects. The worst part: 34 per cent of Australian vegetable growers are considering leaving the industry. That's within the next 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a better way. A coalition government will reinstate the live sheep export trade. We will bring back the ag visa and fix the PALM scheme so it's working appropriately and effectively. We will ensure the 88-day backpacker visa remains in place, and we will not introduce a container levy that Australian farmers have to pay for. We will fix the energy crisis in this country by creating a mix of energy sources, instead of Labor's reckless race to renewables. We will stop Labor's proposed taxes on superannuation that will impact our farmers. The coalition will keep the supermarkets in check by delivering stronger penalties for anticompetitive behaviour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just had an election in Queensland. What a marvellous result that was for every Queenslander. A Liberal National Party was elected under the leadership of David Crisafulli, and I congratulate the team wholeheartedly. I encourage the Prime Minister to head down to the Governor-General and call for a federal election. Australians have had enough. They've had enough of not feeling safe, they've had enough of crime and they've had enough of sky-high energy prices. They want to be able to afford to build a home. Australians are doing it tough and we need a Liberal National government. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  The first half of the member for Capricornia's motion is actually quite sound. Agriculture certainly is of vital importance to Australia, and the sector requires a government that works actively to support it. I say that having grown up on farms in Mildura and seeing firsthand both the immense work that goes into Australian agriculture and the significant value that comes from that effort not just economically, locally and across the nation, but also socially. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Capricornia would know quite well that the work of farmers and their families builds communities from the ground up, and the impact has become a significant piece of the Australian story. My own electorate of Spence, with its own periurban localities, is a prime example of the holistic value of agriculture. The Northern Adelaide Plains Food Cluster, which includes areas such as Virginia, Angle Vale and Gawler Belt, produces approximately 200,000 tonnes of fresh produce and over $300 million in farm gate value every year. That is a third of South Australia's overall agricultural production. This cluster has become a valuable community group in itself. It is one that I continue to engage with, and their importance cannot be understated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Capricornia and I, and, indeed, all of my Labor colleagues, can definitely agree on the significance of agriculture. It then begs the question: why does the member for Capricornia and the rest of her colleagues proceed to consistently attack policy to support the sector? The member states in the motion that farmers are facing increased pressure due to action taken by the federal government. This simply isn't inaccurate. In fact, the reality of the situation is quite the opposite. This is a government working to lift pressure from the backs of farmers, regardless of the opposition's refusal to support or even acknowledge these efforts—which is a shame. We're delivering much-needed support the sector, having engaged with a variety of farmers and bodies across Australian agriculture to inform our approach. That includes biosecurity funding, totalling more than $1 billion, to continue Australia's world-leading record in this space and ensure the $84 billion agricultural industry continues to grow. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no accident that Australia remains the only continent free from the avian influenza H5N1. We invested another $95 million last month to help keep things that way, further boosting the stability of Australian agriculture. This government is also opening the doors to new trade opportunities across the world—in China, India, Thailand, the UAE and more—after a decade of neglect towards our trade relationships by those opposite. As a result, our farmers are now working within the most diversified export market in Australian history, including 169 countries in the last financial year, achieved under this Labor government. In all, we've delivered over $3 billion of extra funding to the agricultural sector since coming to office in 2022. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Better still, that funding is not only throwing much-needed government weight behind farmers when they need it most but working to fight the cost of living across this country. It is applying downward pressure on food prices in shops by backing farmers on the land and working to improve their productivity because, as a Labor government, we know that a healthy agricultural sector in Australia is what helps make fresh produce more affordable when it reaches the consumer. That's why we're committed to helping grow the value of Australian agriculture to $100 billion by 2030. It's already projected to reach over $86 billion by the end of this financial year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To link higher food prices in this country to government support that's been actively delivered to the agricultural sector, as the member for Capricornia is trying to do, just doesn't stack up. Not only does it turn Australian agriculture into a numbers game, to be won or lost by the opposition; that motion also works against the interests of farmers, as well as the rest of Australia, given our nation's dependence, both in the regions and in the cities, on their efforts. The Labor government is getting on with the job, providing farmers the support needed to whether difficult economic conditions. The opposition is choosing to use those conditions to build a narrative, instead of offering solutions. I thank the house.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I thank the member for Capricornia for bringing forward this motion. This is a chance to recognise just how crucial agriculture is for Australia's economy, society and environment. Agriculture isn't just another industry; it's a key part of our success and essential to our way of life. In the 2023-2024 financial year alone, Australia's agriculture sector generated over $82 billion, supporting economic growth and helping our country remain resilient. It also provided over 257,000 jobs, many in rural and regional areas just like mine in the Hunter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 90 per cent of the fresh fruit and vegetables, the meat, the milk and the eggs on Australian shelves is grown right here. This high level of local production shows the dedication of our farmers and reflects our commitment to food security, ensuring that Australians can rely on homegrown food. The cost of living is an ever-present concern for Australians, particularly as food and grocery prices continue to impact household budgets, but this government understands the pressure that rising prices place on families and communities across the nation, and we're committed to ensuring that Australians pay a fair price for their groceries while farmers are fairly compensated for their hard work. Our government has taken the bold step of addressing the issues that drive up costs at the checkout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recently allocated $2.1 million to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to look into the high electronic payment surcharges which impact Australians in a cashless world. Many Australians face these extra fees on essential purchases and think it's unfair, just like I do. That's why, starting 1 January 2026, following consultations with the Reserve Bank of Australia, we plan to ban debit card surcharges. Our goal is clear: we need to reduce costs for consumers without negatively impacting small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October, the Treasurer introduced the biggest reform of Australia's merger laws in 50 years. This change means that mergers, especially in the supermarket industry, will face strong scrutiny from the ACCC to ensure fair prices. This reform is part of our commitment to competition and transparency so Australians know they aren't being overcharged. We're also tackling shrinkflation, which is when products shrink in size but prices stay the same. Last month we announced changes to the Unit Pricing Code to make sure that consumers can compare prices more accurately. There will be stronger penalties for companies that don't follow the code, and the ACCC will start an awareness campaign to help shoppers find the best deals. Additionally, we're holding big supermarkets accountable for misleading pricing. In September this year, the ACCC took legal action against Coles and Woolies for allegedly deceptive discount pricing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This step was part of the extra $30 million we have given the ACCC to address retail sector misconduct, protecting consumers and suppliers alike. In September, we released the ACCC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Supermarkets inquiry </span><span style="font-style:italic;">interim </span><span style="font-style:italic;">report</span>, which raised concerns about supermarket pricing, supplier treatment and barriers to competition. With the ACCC's final report due in February, we will have the information needed to create a fairer, more competitive market for all Australians. We're also improving protections for suppliers, particularly small business. The new code of conduct, based on recommendations from Dr Craig Emerson's review, will protect suppliers from retaliation with improved dispute processes and a confidential whistleblower system through the ACCC. This step helps make grocery supply chains fairer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking forward, we're working with state and territory governments to fix competition barriers in planning and zoning rules, which often allow big players to control large portions of the market, limiting choice and keeping prices high. Reforming these rules is essential for a more competitive and consumer-friendly supermarket sector. Last year, we raised penalties for corporations involved in misconduct, increasing them from $10 million to $50 million, with turnover based penalties going from 10 per cent to 30 per cent of their annual turnover during the breach. The change ensures that the penalties reflect the seriousness of the offence and act as a strong deterrent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve to know that their government is working hard to protect them from high costs. Through these actions, we're addressing every part of the problem, from how prices are set to how supermarkets operate. We are committed to fair prices, transparency and protecting consumers. This government will keep strengthening these measures, working towards a grocery sector that offers fair value for consumers, fair pay for farmers and accountability for retailers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  The West Pennant Hills Cherrybrook Football Club and the West Pennant Hills Cherrybrook Cricket Club are based at Campbell Park. The football club, the Lions, was established in 1969, and the cricket club dates back to the 1930s. Since then, both clubs have gone from strength to strength, with tens of thousands of players calling West Pennant Hills Cherrybrook home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the Lions' greatest milestones came in 1985 with the introduction of women's soccer teams. In one year alone they won three premierships, four championships and two pennants. The cricket club, which is one of the largest in Australia, was home to Lisa Sthalekar, a former Australian women's captain, and also to Denise Annetts, who holds the highest test average of any living person: 81.9. The club won Cricket Australia's Women and Girls Initiative of the Year in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these successes, their facilities are not up to scratch. Great clubs deserve great facilities. After speaking with Keith Everard and Mike Pompeii from the Lions and Ross Anderson from the cricket club, I had a look around Campbell Park recently and saw the need for urgent upgrades. Their hardworking club volunteers know that, with more women getting involved in soccer and cricket, it's essential that there are facilities to support them. Since I was first elected I have taken up the fight and delivered for many local clubs, including funding for new clubhouses, re-turfing, equipment, storage facilities and bathrooms. I've listened to the clubs at West Pennant Hills Cherrybrook and I've started working on a plan for how to support them as they grow and continue their tradition of making our community proud.</span>

Bendigo will now have access to bulk-billed, high-quality health care seven days a week. In its first month alone, this clinic had over 800 visits, demonstrating the critical need for this service in my electorate. The largest proportion of presentations to the Medicare urgent care clinic were children. Over one in three visitors were under the age of 18. As a mum of a three-year-old and a four-year-old, I know, from talking to kinder parents, how this service has made a difference. Almost half of these visits have occurred after hours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bendigo has struggled to attract GPs to do after-hours services, so this clinic is making a difference. Importantly, this clinic is taking the pressure off the Bendigo Health emergency department, which is just around the corner. The clinic has already demonstrated, in data provided by Bendigo Health, that one in three visits to the emergency department are non-life-threatening conditions; therefore, having this clinic does give people an alternative. As I said, there is very limited access to after-hours GP services, meaning that people end up at ED.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  Queenslanders woke to an LNP state government last Sunday—a divisive, out-of-touch, untrustworthy government who are already moving to scrap renewables projects, scrap the Path to Treaty and send more kids to jail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a federal election coming up, and it's clear we can't take anything for granted. Peter Dutton's Liberal-National coalition are up in the polls, and this should be a concern for all of us. Peter Dutton doesn't represent everyday Australians and he doesn't represent the people of Ryan, their values and their hopes. Dutton's agenda is extreme. It's negative, it's divisive and it's out of date. Dutton wants to derail our shift to renewable energy in favour of an expensive, dangerous nuclear fantasy. When Dutton was health minister, he tried to abolish bulk-billing. He cut and froze the Medicare rebate, leading to its eventual collapse. Dutton opposed same-sex marriage, voted to weaken a woman's right to choose and is responsible for refugees being deported back to danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During a cost-of-living crisis, Labor's inaction has given more oxygen to Dutton, and it's time to fight back. The only way to stop Dutton's divisive and out-of-date agenda is with a positive plan for reform and a hopeful message about our future, and that's what the Greens will fight for.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Festivals like Diwali are a reminder of the spirit of the Hindu community. Diwali encourages an annual reflection: give and forgive, unite and unify, prosper and progress. These are all qualities that shine through consistently in the local BAPS community in the way they work in so many charitable endeavours and the way the community reach out to the broader Canberra community and welcome them in.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Festivals like Diwali also remind us of the importance of celebrating our multicultural identity and how diversity enriches Australian life. By working together we can create a more safe and harmonious society for all. In this light, we stand with the Hindu communities that practise their faith in Florey and Mawson and experienced vandalism to their places of worship the weekend before Diwali. Targeting any place of worship is unacceptable. We need to stand united against such acts of hatred and intolerance. When we do so, together we can ensure light overcomes darkness.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  I table a petition in relation to the protection of native bushland. This petition has been signed by over 25,000 Australians desperate to end the destructive and uneconomic practices of native forest logging and deforestation. The petition is part of a campaign I've been running to save the Aussie bush. The Australian government is permitting native plants and animals to be pushed to the brink of extinction, and what's worse is that tens of millions of taxpayer dollars are being used to do it. Not only are we paying forestry corporations to log our native Aussie bush but it is being used to produce low-value products like wood chips and tomato stakes, all for a financial loss. Native bushland deserves protection. The Albanese government has the power to do it this year. This petition shows the community wants it done.</span>

Aunty Joyce grew up on Ulgundahi mission on the Clarence River. Her work dated back to before the 1967 referendum, right through to the referendum last year. In 1996 Aunty Della Walker and Aunty Joyce began the landmark Yaegl native title claim. This led to recognition of title over 90 kilometres of coast and sea, the first of its kind in New South Wales. She did this alongside her husband, Colin, a strong ally to Indigenous people, and with their four daughters. Both were committed to the Labor cause, with Joyce running for preselection in the 1980s. Aunty Joyce was a living example of the resilience of First Nations culture and people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aunty Jennifer Newman was a proud Wiradjuri woman, who lived in the inner west. A talented storyteller, she used her skill to build understanding and recognition across Australia. Aunty Jennifer felt a deep connection to country and caring for country. Part of her legacy will be as president of the Cooks River Valley Association.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  For 773 days, the communities of Eungella and the Pioneer Valley lived in the shadow of an impending environmental catastrophe. The previous state Labor government's Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro scheme was more than a misguided project; it was an assault on one of Australia's most ecologically diverse rainforests, a plan that threatened to scar the very heart of our region's natural beauty. This wasn't just an environmental disaster in the making; it was a fiscal sham. The former Premier's agenda would have drained Queensland taxpayers of a staggering $36 billion, all in the name of ideological policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our communities didn't stand by and watch; we fought with every fibre of our being. It was my honour to join the dedicated residents who refused to accept the twisted narratives fed to us by a government willing to trade our precious ecosystems for political gain. Together we fought their reckless disregard for our environment and our children's future. With over 12,000 voices united, our petition to save Eungella echoed across the state. Today I'm thrilled to announce that our hard work has paid off. Under the leadership of the LNP Crisafulli government, the nightmare of the Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro scheme is now just that: a bad dream that will never see the light of day. We stood together, we persevered and we saved Eungella.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Did you know that more than 76,000 kids in Australia showed up to homeless shelters and many were unaccompanied by adults.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Many homeless shelters are under-supplied and understaffed which means they are turning away people who need a safe place to stay.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">First, we should all appreciate staff at homeless shelters for all the help and time they are giving to the community. They are seriously undervalued.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, most homeless shelters don't have enough supplies to handle a lot of homeless people. They need more money and resources.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Do you know what the main cause of homelessness is? Domestic violence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In June 2021, over 700 million people were put to stop domestic violence but that was just in NSW, we need a more substantial Australia-wide plan.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I want Australia in the next ten years to get more people off the streets and into a safe place and solve some of the problems that cause homelessness.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  A lot has happened in my electorate of Fowler in the month of October. I was honoured to be part of the centenary celebration of Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Fairfield, a parish that is a pillar of strength and connection for our culturally diverse families under the spiritual guidance of Father Bob. I know he has had a long-term illness and is just coming back to the parish. Bishop Danny Maher's homily spoke to the significant role the church played in the lives of the multicultural congregation. I also joined in seeing St. Gertrude's Parish in Smithfield to mark its 75th anniversary and the 20th anniversary of the Pauline Fathers as pastoral carers of the parish. I joined them in dancing and celebrating a significant milestone at the Club Marconi.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we didn't just celebrate a religious milestone; we also celebrated a cultural milestone when I joined the Timor Chinese Association's 23rd inaugural presidential dinner at Crystal Palace in Canley Heights, where my office is located, to welcome the new president, Mr William K Leong. I wish him and his committee continuing success in their community work in supporting those most in need in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I rise to acknowledge the many years of hard work and kindness of local Bunbury mechanic Nathan Reed. Nathan, the owner of Advanced Auto Solutions, has since 2016 partnered with the South West Refuge, a women's refuge now known as Harbour, providing used, roadworthy vehicles to women and families affected by domestic violence. Nathan takes vehicles that have been kindly donated, works on them at his own cost to ensure they're roadworthy and pays for a period of registration of those vehicles before donating them to women and families in need. A recent recipient of his generosity is a mother of four who previously had to spend up to $80 a day on taxis to get her kids to school and other activities. On top of the donation, Nathan has covered the cost of two ongoing services for the vehicle itself. These are lifechanging donations. Nathan, because of you, women and their families are able to start rebuilding their lives after dealing with the trauma of domestic violence and regain a sense of independence. Your generosity and hard work are a great example of the impact one act of kindness can have on a person's future. Thank you also to the community members who donate the vehicles that allow these women a fresh start. Anyone who can help, please get in touch with my office, and we'll put you in touch with Nathan. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  I recently caught up with dozens of seniors from Leonay, Emu Plains, Emu Heights and the lower Blue Mountains at my seniors forum. It was held at Emu Sports Club, and I was delighted to have the Assistant Minister for Ageing and Social Security, Kate Thwaites, join me as we discussed everything from aged-care reforms to supporting people to stay longer in their own homes, through to pensions and the challenges of being a self-funded retiree, the seniors healthcare card, housing challenges in the home equity scheme, and other supports available through Services Australia. I thank everyone who gave up their time. While I am incredibly proud of the changes that we've made, I know there's more to do as we reform systems so older people are treated with the dignity and the respect that they deserve. Getting residential care right is also a big priority for the Albanese government, with new standards of care and quality already in place, and additional wages for the ever-caring workers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The assistant minister and I visited the Uniting Care residential facility in Emu Plains—Edinglassie—which has a four-star My Aged Care rating. We spoke with the ladies doing word games, who proved to be quicker at those word puzzles than we were, and chatted over afternoon tea. I got to see beautiful grandchildren—it was a pleasure to visit.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  The unrealised capital gains issue—call it a Labor threat—still hangs like the sword of Damocles over Australian farmers. Whilst abroad last week I was interested to read an editorial in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span> for 1 November which read:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many will have no option but to sell up to pay the bill, destroying businesses held by families for generations and destabilising food security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The comment piece was talking about new taxes being placed on British farmers, but it continued:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But why would Labour be bothered? They calculate their voter base is predominantly urban, so it does little political harm. And if it means green fields can be sold off for solar farms or new housing, all the better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Farmers work backbreakingly hard to keep society fed. Their hours are long. And because of their careful stewardship, our countryside remains a precious asset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any fair-minded government would shower them with rewards, not hit them a punishing and pernicious new tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I say, but you could replace Labour Britain with Labor Australia, because the facts remain the same. Why is it the Left are always punishing our farmers with new taxes? Why is it the Left don't realise or care or understand or know where their food and fibre comes from? It is our farmers who feed our people. It is the farmers who help our exports. It is our farmers who help this country so much and continually get whacked by Labor governments wherever they are.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I'm thrilled once again to be participating in the Raise Our Voice campaign, which champions the voices of young Australians by giving them a voice in parliament. This year's topic was: what do you want your community to look like in the next 10 years, and what can the next parliament to do to achieve it? It was difficult to choose just one entry, so here's a small sample of some of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amber and Baden from New Norfolk said, 'We think there should be a KFC in New Norfolk because it's not fair to have to drive 20 minutes then come back with food that isn't finger lickin' good anymore.' Jack and Seth, also from New Norfolk—I reckon they were sitting next to each other—said: 'Imagine a World where you don't have to drive for that irresistible KFC flavour. A KFC New Norfolk' contributes to shaping our community's development. Lacie, also from New Norfolk, said: 'I would like to see more family bike tracks in the Derwent Valley, to get more young people off their devices to see the beautiful world we have.' Hip, hip, hooray! Ashley from Molesworth Primary School said, 'I would like to see more National Parks, nature walks and bike tracks added to our community, to get us outside and off our devices more.' Hear, hear, Ashley!</span>

So today I rise to speak about my friend Jim Ryan. Jim died on 28 August this year, and his life was celebrated by friends and family in a beautiful ceremony on Arthurs Seat on 13 October. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Jim on Main Street in Hastings during the last election campaign. He was selling Anzac Day badges, a thing he did every year. He greeted me like he was my grandfather. 'I was waiting for you,' he said, knowing full well that my new life as the candidate for Flinders would lead me to his feet one day. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim was a great volunteer in life. He was there for every single cause, like the Red Hill Show, where he was the vice-president; Second Bite; and, indeed, the Liberal Party, where he was the driver of the 'Briony bus' during Briony Hutton's contest for Hastings at the state election. He was there every day on prepoll for me too, handing out how-to-vote cards. But mostly he was just there filling my heart each and every time I saw him.</span>

I will miss you forever, my dear friend Jim.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I know how important education is to my wonderful community in Chisholm, and it's really important to me too. I've always been an advocate of accessible and affordable pathways to higher and vocational education, and the opportunities that they deliver for people, communities and, indeed, our nation. I'm really pleased that a re-elected Albanese Labor government will cut student debt by 20 per cent for everyone. It will also reduce the amount graduates have to repay each year and will make free TAFE courses permanent. This is just the start of our positive plan for a second term—helping with the cost of living and building Australia's future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been working hard to take pressure off Australians. We know it's been tough for people. Labor has rolled out tax cuts for every taxpayer. We've boosted bulk-billing and we've made child care and medicine cheaper. Our second term will build on these strong foundations. We'll cut around $5½ thousand from an average university student's debt, and making the repayment system fairer will ensure that take-home pay will be boosted for people repaying student debt. This is about putting money back into the pockets of young people and putting intergenerational equity back into the system. Together, we can keep building Australia's future.</span>

Under this government, building approvals have fallen to their lowest level in over a decade, dropping 8.8 per cent to just 158,690 new starts in the year 2023-24. Simultaneously, the government have brought in more than one million migrants in their first two years in office, whilst only 350,000 homes have been constructed during that time. What a joke!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response, we have announced our plan to keep the dream alive by boosting supply and reducing demand. Our $5 billion housing infrastructure program will help to deliver 500,000 new homes by providing funding to complete essential enabling infrastructure, like water, power, sewerage and access roads. There are hundreds of greenfield sites across the country ready for development, but progress has been stalled due to a lack of funding for this enabling infrastructure. A Peter Dutton led government will also bring down demand by reducing immigration, implementing a two-year ban on foreign investors purchasing existing homes and capping the number of overseas students. These changes will free up over 100,000 homes over five years. The next election will be a clear choice between a coalition government and a Labor government that has crushed the dream of homeownership.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  In the recent weeks I've been chatting with residents across Lane Cove, Gladesville and Ryde, listening to their experience with our local bus services. I've heard about missed buses, overcrowded routes and far too often people left stranded. Parents are understandably anxious about their children getting to school safely, and workers need reliable services to get around on time. Since their bus services were privatised by the last state Liberal government, our bus network has suffered. This eight-year contract has bought on delays, contested timetable changes and ongoing issues with driver shortages. Privatisation, of course, has also made these issues more difficult to address. Privatisation promised improvements, yet the outcomes have shown otherwise. Routes 288, 292, 533 and others have had issues since recent changes, and frequency, overcrowding and reliability have been issues raised directly with me. This is unacceptable, and it impacts families every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, this is very much a state issue, but locals know that when I see an issue in my community I'm always willing to help. That's why today I'm launching a community survey to hear directly from those locals affected by these changes. I need locals to help me identify the issues so that I can fight for you to get them addressed. Feedback received will go straight to the New South Wales government, as we work together towards better public transport in Bennelong.</span>

Voters in Gympie showed their ongoing confidence in Tony Perrett, and I congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Primary Industries. I congratulate Deb Frecklington, in Nanango, for her success and appointment as Queensland's Attorney-General. I congratulate my friend and former police officer Marty Hunt who retook Nicklin for the LNP, and, in Noosa, Clare Stewart ran a campaign that demonstrated her dedication and dignity. While the 15.8 per cent margin Clare was up against was always going to be a mammoth challenge to overcome, she achieved an incredible seven per cent swing to the LNP. I thank Clare for her effort, and I know she has much to offer the community into the future. I congratulate Sandy Bolton on her re-election. In Maryborough, John Barounis ran an exceptional grassroots campaign and claimed a seemingly impossible victory in what was a remarkable win. I congratulate John and his campaign manager, John McDonald, for their admirable effort. I also acknowledge the former member for Maryborough, Bruce Saunders, and acknowledge his nine years of service to the electorate. The LNP campaigns rely on volunteers, and I thank them all for their great effort in securing a wonderful victory for the LNP in Queensland.</span>

This month, 113 Hindu community organisations and 561 volunteers across Australia united in this remarkable effort. Together, they have collected over 24,000 kilograms of groceries for organisations in need, including 3,000 collected just in my state of Victoria. These groceries have been donated to organisations, including Perth Homeless Support Group in WA, OzHarvest in the ACT, Karma Kitchen in New South Wales, and Foodbank in Victoria, WA, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  Communities in the Riverland are bracing themselves for the economic fallout of water buybacks and will inevitably see a decline in primary production and in the economic activity that goes with it in the region. I'll always stand against any policy that reduces the ability of farmers to grow food and fibre in this country. I want to see a thriving and diverse Riverland where we not only continue the proud tradition of producing high-quality food but we also warmly welcome visitors to our riverbanks and we protect and preserve the unique ecology of the region. That's why I'm such a strong supporter of Calperum station as part the Riverland's diverse offering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Calperum creates important employment and training opportunities, environmental education and ecological preservation and boosts the visitor economy. With the right investment, the possibility for increasing this positive contribution is almost endless, but ageing infrastructure at Calperum is an impediment to sustainability and growth. It's incredibly frustrating to watch projects like Calperum Connect being put on hold while building costs blow out and co-contributions are withdrawn as a result of state Labor's lack of support for the project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as I will take up the fight on water rights to protect and respect the generations of growers, so too will I fight for funding to support the ecotourism and the education and training offerings at Calperum station. A strong Riverland needs a strong Calperum, and I'm committed to giving them the infrastructure they need.</span>

They're everywhere, tirelessly helping those in need. Usually, they work quietly behind the scenes without fanfare, except when the Tassie bash comes to town. What's not to love about buying an old car and giving that car a decent whimsical dose of Wick'ety Wack, driving around Tassie with your mates and raising money for kids in need?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another great charity is Rapid Relief Tasmania. They pulled out all the stops with breakfast, hot coffee, fresh fruit and egg-and-bacon sangers when the bashers visited Penguin pitstop recently. The bashers visited Forth Primary School, Boat Harbour, Smithton, Redpa Primary School and the North West Support School. I've got no doubt that their visit made those kids' year. It absolutely did. Knowing somebody is out there thinking of them is often enough. So TasBash 2024 is a wrap—1,230 kilometres, 15 themed cars, dozens of passionate bashers and over $283,000 raised for Tasmanian kids. There's no doubt charities like Variety and RRT are making the country better. I can't thank them enough and all our great charities enough for all that they do.</span>

The event was hosted by Multicultural Community Services of Central Australia, which has been supporting people coming to Alice Springs of a very culturally and linguistically diverse background since 1985. The event was well attended with great entertainers and community leaders. We thoroughly enjoyed meeting these proud Territorians who now call Alice Springs home and enjoying the celebrations of their rich cultural diversity. It was great to be part of Multicultural Community Services of Central Australia's round table, with many of the multicultural communities participating in exemplary work and leadership in the business community in Alice Springs.</span>

It was fantastic to be part of those celebrations over the two days with the minister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Last month, hundreds gathered at the Rock Christian Church in Capalaba to bid farewell to Wendy Tidbold, a lifelong local whose legacy as a horse rider, saddler, wife, mother, grandmother and friend has left an indelible mark on the Redlands and beyond. She was a global leader in her field and a highly respected member of my community. Wendy rode horses nearly all her life and competed in dressage and showjumping. She was a gifted craftswoman, and her products were renowned far and wide. Wendy was a steadfast supporter of side-saddle riding in Australia and generously shared her time and knowledge. We were reminded at her funeral that she loved to be challenged and that the word 'can't' simply did not exist within her vocabulary.</span>

They remember her not only for her dedication to her craft but for her faith, her kindness and her joy in life's simple moments. Wendy's warmth extended to her customers and friends, who she treated like family. Those of us who met her and knew her knew that they were in the company of someone truly remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wendy's loyalty and devotion anchored those she loved, and her faith gave her a profound sense of purpose. Her family carries forward her legacy of resilience, passion and generosity. Her spirit lives on in each story told, each laugh shared and each saddle crafted with love. Our thoughts and prayers go out to her husband, Mike, her children and her grandchildren. We will miss Wendy very much.</span>

Like many in this place, I was the first in my family to go to university. It changed my life, and it changed the lives of my family. Increasingly, tertiary qualifications—TAFE or university—are required to get a job or to continue to get ahead in your career. Employers need skilled workers, industries need skilled workers, and certainly industries of the future will need skilled workers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to ensuring that top-quality, affordable education is available for all Australians and we're acting on it. Pay rises for early childhood education workers is part of building up a skilled workforce in early childhood education to make it a career of choice, which supports the development of skills of our youngest Australians. We have millions on the table to fund public education at primary and high school levels. We have changed the way HECS debts are calculated so that indexing never again rises more than the wage price index and backdated it, reversing last year's increases, and the massively oversubscribed fee-free TAFE has enabled Australians to access training in areas most at need: early childhood education, IT and, of course, trades. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have announced that a re-elected Albanese Labor government will cut 20 per cent off every HECS debt and make fee-free TAFE permanent, because we are backing a future made in Australia and we're backing Australians.</span>

Angela was last month inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, at their 68th annual Order of Sport awards, having already been inducted to be Athletics Canada Hall of Fame, in 2019. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why am I talking about Angela Doyle, who's in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame? Angela is a constituent and lives in Bundaberg, would you believe. Angela is married to Simon Doyle, a very well-known local, who himself is no slouch on the world stage of athletics, and with their children, Michael and Emily, live on a farm near the hummock in Bundaberg. What an incredible record she has. To have somebody of this standard in our local region deserves to be acknowledged. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Angela was born to a Sioux woman and a soldier of Scottish-Canadian ancestry. She's a member of the Birdtail Sioux nation and lived with her military family in various cities. She grew up racing against her brothers, and those races taught her how to push herself to win. She has an incredible list of achievements, and I won't to get through them all. In 1990, she made history as the first female athlete to win gold in both the 1,500-metre and 3,000-metre races at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland. At the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Victoria, Canada, she was the Canadian team flag-bearer for the opening ceremony and defended her 3,000-metre gold medal in those games. In the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, she won bronze in the 3,000-metre race. There is an incredible list. Congratulations, Angela. You deserve to be recognised. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I rise in support of the member for Wentworth's motion urging the government to commit to a better, more transparent and responsive approach to infrastructure projects. This motion goes to two fundamental reforms about infrastructure: how we select big infrastructure projects and when we undertake them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big infrastructure projects can be a useful economic management tool. In response to the COVID-19 economic downturn, the federal government made substantial commitments to infrastructure developments, as did state territory governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In theory, this was consistent with sound economic policy. When the economy is weak, that's the right time to stimulate it with big projects. But the Australian economy recovered far more quickly than expected. This was obviously good news, but, when it did, we didn't adjust the infrastructure decisions accordingly. So our current high-level infrastructure spending is in fact driving prices up. The 10-year $120-billion infrastructure investment pipeline is now crowding out private sector investment. Multiple recent independent reviews have shown this. Big public projects should be timed to fill the troughs in the economic cycle rather than compete during construction-sector peaks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year's independent review of the Infrastructure Investment Program showed $33 billion in additional known cost pressures as a result of a clogged infrastructure pipeline. This is currently particularly painful because we desperately need to build more homes and we need the people and materials to build them. At the moment, the housing sector, the mining sector—particularly in WA—and the clean energy sector are competing with large-scale infrastructure projects for construction-sector workers. While not all trades and skills are transferable between sectors, many are, and current strong employment conditions make it harder to expand the domestic construction workforce. Something's got to give. Some of the $120 billion of committed infrastructure projects should wait so that we can build the homes we need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prioritising and scaling back infrastructure spending until we have sufficient resources of both labour and materials to meet demand would stop pushing up prices for labour and materials and contribute to lowering inflation. It would mean that the most critical projects could be completed in shorter timeframes with less pressure on costs, and it would reduce pressure on the housing sector and stop crowding out private-sector spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But how would we prioritise infrastructure projects? Which are the best projects? These questions lead to the other big change proposed in this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was absolutely floored when I found out that big infrastructure projects don't have to have a business case. That's right: government can commit to spending hundreds of millions—even billions—of dollars without proving that the project is needed, that it will deliver benefits or that it's worth doing. Coming from the private sector, this is astounding. You can't spend shareholder money without justifying it. But, when it comes to taxpayer money, if it's popular, or the party in government at the moment wants it, that's good enough, even if it makes no actual sense. Governments should have to explain to the public: 'Why are we doing this? What outcomes do we hope to achieve? How will we know if we've achieved these outcomes? Do the numbers stack up?' Robust business cases should be required for all infrastructure projects and made public to allow for scrutiny and community oversight. An amendment to this effect was proposed by the member for Wentworth, which I backed, just for projects over $100 million, and it was rejected by both the major parties, who ultimately don't want the headache of actual accountability when they are in government. Also, after projects have been delivered, they should have to be evaluated. Can you believe they don't have to be? We never find out if a project actually achieved its goals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's too little accountability when it comes to spending our money. If governments are spending taxpayer money, they should have to spend it well and spend it at the right time. We must focus on investments that improve the productive capacity of our economy and contribute to explicitly stated long-term goals, whether economic or social or environmental. This is particularly important now, in an environment of high inflation, with pressure on the budget in the medium to long term. I urge the government to respond to the two independent inquiries calling for better processes for infrastructure decisions—to do what any company must do, and actually have a defensible business case for spending taxpayer money on infrastructure, and to pause non-essential infrastructure for now so that we can build the homes that we need. We urgently need better transparency and accountability in our infrastructure projects.</span>

                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  The Albanese Labor government has reformed Australia's infrastructure pipeline, ensuring our investments in the nation's infrastructure grow, so that the economy improves in productivity and takes pressure off inflation. We all know that infrastructure projects, whether they be bridges, roads or other types of projects, are an important part of assisting and enhancing our communities. Infrastructure grows the economy and ensures positions and jobs for workers. It enhances the economy of a particular area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to have currently in my electorate three major infrastructure projects—and many, many more, but I'll speak about three of them today. The first is the North-South Corridor, the Torrens to Darlington project, which was announced back in 2013. I was there for the first sod turning when the current Prime Minister was then the transport minister. This $15.4 billion project goes straight through my electorate, through South Road. It's being delivered in partnership with the state government of South Australia. It will upgrade the North-South Corridor between the River Torrens and Darlington. The section specific to my electorate will be from the River Torrens all the way down to the Kurralta Park and Plympton area, which is absolutely congested with motor vehicles from 6 am right through to 8 pm or 9 pm every single day. This motorway will free up traffic, allowing people to save time on their trips to and from work. Even 10 minutes a day, when you add it up, is 50 minutes at the end of the week or 60 minutes for people who work six days a week. Think about that. That one extra hour to read to the children before they go to bed, to help prepare dinner—to spend quality time with your family—makes a massive difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once finished, the River Torrens to Darlington project will allow motorists to avoid 21 existing sets of traffic lights between the River Torrens and Darlington. It will complete the non-stop, 78-kilometre North-South Corridor between Gawler and Old Noarlunga. Back in August I was delighted to join the Prime Minister, the Premier of South Australia and the other state and federal members of parliament whose electorates this project will go through to announce the preferred alliance partner to deliver South Australia's biggest ever infrastructure project. The Torrens to Darlington project will support approximately 5,500 jobs per year during main construction. Ninety per cent of labour hours will be undertaken by South Australians, with an agreed minimum six per cent Indigenous employment on the project, 600 jobs for apprentices and trainees, and opportunities for more than 220 long-term unemployed people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, another exciting project is the $90 million—again fifty-fifty with the state government—Grange Road, Holbrooks Road and East Avenue intersection upgrade to relieve congestion and improve safety and connectivity for all road users at that location. The upgrade will remove a staggered intersection and create a direct connection, across Grange Road, between Holbrooks Road and East Avenue. I have spent over the decade writing to different transport ministers about this project and I'm very pleased that this Labor government has listened and made this announcement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project, being delivered as part of an $850 million suite of projects, is designed to ensure Adelaide's road network functions efficiently during construction of the T2D project—the Torrens to Darlington project—and once it is completed. Community engagement on the project is continuing, and, judging by the large turnout at recent community meetings, I know the community is excited about the upgrade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to mention the tram grade separation projects. These will benefit residents in the federal electorates of Adelaide, Boothby and Hindmarsh. We are investing $600 million to remove three level crossings where the Glenelg tram line crosses Marion Road and Cross Road, Plympton, and Morphett Road, Morphettville. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I want to thank the member for Gilmore for introducing this really important motion to the House. One of the great pleasures in this job is being able to visit our wonderful early learning centres in the electorate and meet some of our youngest citizens. I recently had the pleasure of joining the Prime Minister in Mount Waverly at an early childhood education centre, and I visited Glen Iris with Minister Anne Aly. It was truly a wonderful experience, learning from the children and seeing how they learn, and that their minds are being sharpened through play. It was great to read stories with the children and share in singing with them too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, of course, recognises the transformative benefits of early childhood education and care for children and families. I want to thank families, and I want to thank educators at this point too, for their incredible advocacy in pushing governments, like ours, to take steps to properly recognise and remunerate the work that gets done in the sector every day. We're working to build a universal early childhood education and care system that is accessible for all families, no matter their circumstances or background. We've already taken some critical first steps in this regard, including making early childhood education more affordable for over a million families through our cheaper child care reforms. Our government also recognises that early learning educators and teachers do a vital job, making it possible for millions of other Australians to do their jobs too and supporting young children's early learning and development. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Productivity Commission report has stated, we must prioritise the early learning workforce before any major reforms, and that's exactly why we have made a historic announcement of a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood education workers. Since coming to government, the early childhood education and care sector has grown by more than 30,000 workers. That's because our government is working with the sector to develop and deliver practical solutions to retain staff, while continuing to develop and strengthen work recruitment and training pathways. We already have provided more university and fee-free TAFE places for early childhood education teachers. We have helped deliver a 4.6 per cent pay rise from July 2022, a 5.75 per cent pay rise from July 2023 and a 3.75 per cent pay rise from July of this year. We commissioned the ACCC and Productivity Commission inquiry into the early childhood education and care system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also invested $72.4 million to support the skills and training of a quality and sustainable early childhood education and care sector. Our workforce package is helping to build skills and strengthen the supply of qualified early childhood education and care workers, including through supporting professional development opportunities and paid prac placements. This investment means high-quality early learning educators remain in the sector, and makes it easier for educators to progress their careers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't just take my word for it. We have heard from educators right around the country. Lisa, who's an early childhood educator in New South Wales, has said: 'This is a monumental, history-making moment. This means I can stay in the job that I love and know that it's going to change a lot of lives, not just my own.' Here are some words from Karen, an early childhood educator in Queensland: 'The changes that the Albanese Labor government are bringing in mean that early childhood educators who've been relying on Foodbank to feed their families won't have to do that anymore, and those that worked two or three jobs just to make ends meet will be able to spend more time with their families.' Here are some words from Sia, an early childhood educator from my home state of Victoria: 'Instead of searching for a second job, this pay increase will help me now pay rent and put food on my table.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that educators do is not just important for themselves—putting a roof over their head—but for our communities. It enables more parents to participate in the workforce. Of course, we know the first five years of a child's life are so vital to their learning, so this is setting up the youngest people in our communities with the very best start in life. I'm so pleased with the efforts of our government to recognise the importance of this sector.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  It's pretty much universally agreed in my electorate of North Sydney that those working in the early childhood education and care sector play a vital role in supporting families and parents right across our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021, 93 per cent of workers in the early childhood education and care industry identified as female, adding this profession to a long list of female dominated work environments that are not properly valued by our society or by governments in general. As I stand to speak to this motion, then, today, I think the real question for this parliament is: has it done enough to fundamentally shift our nation's mindset to one which truly values those working in the care economy? After all, following a decade of coalition governments, many would argue this sector and the families that rely on it have never been so pressed as cost-of-living pressures close in on everyone and professionals in the area leave in droves because both their salary and career progression prospects are so poor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, my community fundamentally believes that every childhood educator and carer plays an essential role in shaping our society. Not only do they teach and nurture our kids in their formative years but their very existence helps drive our economy, as they enable millions of Australian parents, most often women, to return to work and pursue the careers they wish to. Despite this contribution, however, for far too long early childhood education and care workers have been appallingly underpaid, contributing to the high turnover and one of the largest unfilled vacancy ratios in any occupation in the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To navigate this complex problem and identify potential policy solutions, I recently hosted the North Sydney early childhood education and care deliberative democracy forum. With 40 residents from North Sydney randomly selected from a wider group of 5,000 invited, the forum was demographically representative of my electorate. The deliberations of this group drew upon both expert input and community submissions to build a community consensus on what they wanted to see me fighting for in this place. By coming to a consensus on a federal policy position that could effectively address affordability and accessibility in the sector, the forum really did unlock my community's thinking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To help inform their views, participants heard from a range of experts, including Early Childhood Australia, the Australia Institute, Australian Childcare Alliance New South Wales, the Centre for Policy Development and the Centre for Research in Early Childhood Education at Macquarie University, with the potential solutions discussed including everything from government funded universal access to early childhood education and care places for all children from birth through to strategies to deal with the discrepancy in remuneration structures for early childhood educators employed in preschools versus those employed in primary schools.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ultimate result of those deliberations made it really clear. My community of North Sydney wants to see early childhood education and care valued more appropriately and not just relegated to 'women's work'. Specifically, they told me they wanted to see free or low-cost access to early childhood education and care integrated into the existing education system and to see it offered universally to all families for children from birth, regardless of where the family lives or their socioeconomic status. They advocated that, while as a society we've come to value education as a basic right for young people, we haven't taken the steps to expand our universal system to cover the early years. They also told me they believe I should be advocating strongly that the early childhood education and care workforce be paid an award commensurate with that of primary school teachers. Finally, they also want to see early childhood education and care facilities built alongside new public primary schools, to ensure adequate supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, communities like mine, where families pay some of the highest childcare fees in the country—an average of nearly $190 per day per child—want to see the early childhood education and care sector recognised and workers properly valued. So, while the government's recent move to raise the wages of early childhood education and care workers is welcome, it is just the first step in a reform process that is well past due. After all, the 15 per cent wage increase will still not bring the average earnings of an early childhood educator and care worker into line with primary school teachers; nor will increasing wages necessarily prevent burnout or increase retention rates, as the lure of employment in the primary school sector will remain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, although the government's 4.4 per cent fee-cap conditions are admirable in trying to ensure wage increases don't necessarily translate to increased fees for families, it does nothing to address how expensive this sector already is in my community. Put simply, early childhood education and care is essential, and people working in that area deserve the respect that is due to them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  It goes without saying that the Albanese government recognises the transformative benefits of early childhood education and care for both children and their families. I should say, 'It should go without saying,' but in this place we are still required to remind all members that it is a really transformative thing to do to have quality early childhood education. We know those first five years are vital. We know that on this side. We know the crossbench, by and large, appreciates that as well. We know that there are people in this place that do not hold that view. They are not listening to the science, but we are, and we are working to build a universal early childhood education and care system that is accessible to every family, no matter what their circumstances or background.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already taken some critical first steps, including to make early childhood education more affordable for more than a million families through our cheaper childcare reforms, but we know that there's more to do to provide long-term sustainable support to parents. I say to people who don't have children, don't think this is not relevant to you. I say to those people, early learning educators and teachers do an absolutely vital job—yes, for the families and the children involved—but they make it possible for millions of other Australians to do their jobs too. If you're a small business or a big business, your workers need to have access to quality affordable childcare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is, we're still not producing enough early educators or keeping enough of them in the system. Since coming to government, we've seen Australia's early childhood education and care sector grow by more than 30,000 workers, and that's because our government is working with the sector to develop and deliver practical solutions to retain staff while continuing to develop and strengthen recruitment and training pathways. We've already provided more university places for early childhood education teachers, and fee-free TAFE. We've helped deliver a 4.6 per cent pay rise from July 2022, a 5.75 per cent pay rise from July 2023, and a 3.7 per cent pay rise from July 2024. We've commissioned the ACCC and the Productivity Commission inquiry into the entire early childhood education and care system. We've also invested $72.4 million to support the skills and training of quality and sustainable early childhood education and care. Our workforce package is helping build skills and strengthen supply of qualified educators, including through supporting professional development opportunities and paid prac.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these things are key, and as the Productivity Commission states, we must prioritise the early learning workforce before any major reforms. That's why we've made an historic announcement for a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood workers. This is a vital investment by the Albanese government to ensure high-quality early childhood educators remain in the sector, and to make it easy for educators to progress their careers. I want to see every eligible early learning educator in Macquarie receive that 15 per cent pay rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware of the challenges that small not-for-profit or small private providers—both long-day care centres and OOSHs—are facing in the implementation of the increase. I was very pleased to host a roundtable discussion last week with departmental officials where directors and key executives of local centres could raise their issues and ask questions frankly. I'm also grateful for the support offered by the United Workers Union to assist these small centres. We haven't solved all the implementation issues yet, and I'll continue to work with local providers across the Blue Mountains, Hawkesbury and Emu Plains regions to get it right. While the 15 per cent increase is not the end of the improvements to conditions for early childhood workers, it's an interim step as other reforms take place. I don't want anyone to miss out on that $100-a-week increase before Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall we're talking about a 15 per cent pay rise over two years, starting in December this year—10 per cent initially, to increase by 15 a year later. The key thing for me is we want to see providers pass all that money onto the workers—that's who deserves it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I rise today to give voice to the deep concerns of families with young children across my electorate of Wannon. Accessible and affordable child care is not a luxury; it's a necessity, yet, for people in regional and rural Australia, especially in my electorate of Wannon, there is not the availability of child care that is needed. What this means is young mums, in particular, are missing out on being able to access the workforce as they should be able to. Not only are young mums missing out; businesses across my electorate are missing out because they're not able to employ these young mothers, who they need to work in their businesses. What is occurring is a double whammy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen from both the federal Labor government and the state Labor government in Victoria? Everything that they are doing is working against childcare availability, and this means young mothers, especially, in the electorate of Wannon are missing out. We've seen the federal government do nothing about broadening access to child care. We've now had green droughts in the electorate of Wannon and right across Australia when it comes to child care, which the government has done nothing about and has not even tried to address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria, it has got even worse. Earlier this year, the Labor state government revealed a very different reality for regional and rural families. They promised to expand access to child care and to build centres in key towns in my electorate, and what have we found out? These have now been delayed, not only delayed for months but delayed, sometimes, for up to a decade. We haven't got time to wait for those sorts of delays. The false promises we're seeing all the time from the state Labor government and now from the federal Labor government are doing nothing to improve the availability of child care in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Albanese Labor government, please think about what you need to do to provide availability in child care right across this nation. Don't just think about the capital cities; think about what you need to be doing right across our country. If you're able to provide greater child care in our regions and country towns—in towns like Warrnambool, Port Fairy, Portland, Hamilton, Colac—what it would mean is that businesses could grow and develop there. Economies would get stronger in those communities, and those communities would get stronger. It would take some of the pressure off our capital cities; it would take some of the pressure off the growth in population that we see in capital cities, with crowded infrastructure, crowded access to hospitals and everything else that comes with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What you need to be doing is making sure you are focused on not only insuring that people are paid properly when it comes to providing childcare services—we're all in agreement about that—but making sure that there is that availability where young mums, in particular, need it. That is my request to this government—make sure you're putting the policies in place that will enable child care to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker talked about the pressure being put on our small and not-for-profit childcare providers. That is something the government also needs to look at and also needs to pay attention to. If you put pressure on those small and not-for-profit providers, what you are doing is harming the provision of child care in regional and rural Victoria, and you won't see it develop and enhance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll end on this point: you also need to be able to provide emergency services quickly when needed. The Casterton childcare centre, which was hit by a severe hailstorm two weeks ago, really needs your help. You need to step in and help them at this moment as well.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I thank the member for Gilmore for moving this motion. I'm pleased to have an opportunity to voice my support for Australia's wonderful early childhood educators and carers and to thank them for their hard work. Moreton has some fantastic early childhood education centres. In fact, I live across the road from one of them—the one that my sons went to—so I had never had a great journey in terms of the double drop-off; I just went across the pedestrian crossing. They're all great places to visit. I'm always inspired by the educators and carers and by their dedication to and enthusiasm about their work. It's great to see the children having fun while learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These centres provide a rich learning environment for 1.8 million Australian children aged from zero to five—that crucial period for brain, language and social development. These years are the building blocks for good health, education and wellbeing for school and later in life. Quality early learning programs also provide children with better educational outcomes. This includes improved literacy and numeracy skills, greater engagement in schooling and completion of school and, ultimately, higher paying jobs. The best part is that the children at these centres are achieving this vital groundwork via play and having fun, the core business of childhood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise the importance of this and, in turn, the importance of supporting the workforce that makes this possible. That's why early childhood educators and carers will receive a 15 per cent pay increase over the next two years. This increase is real and tangible cost-of-living relief for early childhood education workers, as well as an acknowledgement of how much the Labor government values their work. It amounts to a $3.5 billion investment from the Commonwealth government, and it will mean an increase of between $100 and $250 per week for typical workers from December this year, just next month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's vital that we invest in this workforce. We need to retain experienced professionals and attract more workers. I'm pleased to say that since May 2022 the sector has grown by more than 30,000 employees. They've been drawn by more university places for early childhood teachers and the fee-free TAFE initiative. Having a thriving early childhood education sector is essential not only for our children but as a key part of our economy. After all, early childhood educators enable other Australians with young children to go out and do their own jobs, and thanks to Labor initiatives, doing this has become more economical for families rights across Australia. There are over 1.2 million families benefiting from our cheaper childcare reforms. This has reduced the average out-of-pocket cost for centre based daycare by 11 per cent. It makes it so much more affordable for mums and dads to work or to do training or study.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also linked the pay rise for early childhood educators to a condition that, from 24 August, early childhood education centres do not increase their fees by more than 4.4 per cent for the coming year, and we're working on a new index for the year following that. This ensures that families are not faced with fee hikes and that the funding goes to the centres' employees' pay packets. The Labor government's ultimate goal is the provision of a universal early childhood education and care system—something we're working towards steadily, methodically and with significant progress. We commissioned the ACCC and the Productivity Commission to inquire into the early childhood education and care system to guide further reforms, and these findings will be considered over the coming months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the goal of universal early childhood education and care in mind, we know what's required are evidence-based long-term strategies and investment. We want it to be accessible, affordable and inclusive, and we'll work collaboratively to achieve this in the city and in the bush. I'll leave my final words to the centre manager for an early childhood education centre in my home suburb of Moorooka. Karen said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The 15% pay increase for early childhood educators is a great first step for the Early Childhood Sector in recognising and acknowledging the work that we do and supporting the retention of people in our sector. Importantly, I feel it makes Approved Providers more accountable for fee increases, providing transparency, something historically that has not occurred. It supports families with affordability in this current economic climate and truly gives back to the many Educators who work tirelessly each and every day to deliver quality care and education to our most precious little humans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Karen, for your words and for the great work that you and your peers and colleagues do. Thank you to all early childhood educators across Moreton and across this nation. I can't think of a group in society more deserving of that 15 per cent pay increase.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our nation's health statistics are confronting. Our world-class health professionals are working tirelessly, yet patients still struggle to get the treatment they so desperately need. Today we are honoured to have Professor Jane Tiller, an expert in her field, with us in the gallery—welcome to the good professor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to rethink our approach to health care and to consider one that focuses on prevention and the early identification of risk factors before disease manifests. Today I wish to update the House on the potential of preventative genomic testing in reducing disease burdens across the entire country—a shift from a reactive to a proactive form of health care. Genomic testing analyses a person's DNA in order to identify genetic predispositions to certain diseases. For high-risk individuals and their families, having this information early can be lifesaving. It would allow the time to take preventative actions—for instance, regular monitoring or early treatment or, in some cases, even preventative surgery. This would lead to not only better outcomes and fewer hospitalisations but also a significant reduction in long-term healthcare costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The case for increased investment in preventative health care has never been more pressing. Currently, only about two per cent of Australia's healthcare budget is directed towards preventative measures. This contrasts with potential savings from early detection. Genomic testing offers promising investment opportunities for that investment, particularly for conditions such as cancer and heart disease, which have significant health and economic impacts. Limiting funding restricts genomic testing to a narrow post-symptom criteria, yet genomic testing's greatest advantage is the identification well before that. The current criteria-based approach is failing to identify our most high-risk individuals, leaving them unaware and without access to preventative measures. This results in lives consumed by poor health, deaths that could have been prevented and heartache for families for those that lose loved ones. But we could change the scenario. We have the access to this technology that could save lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The DNA Screen study led by Monash University is a recent example of genomic testing's incredible potential. The study screened more than 10,000 young adults for genetic risks linked to cancer and heart disease. It revealed that three-quarters of those identified as high-risk would not have qualified for funded testing under the current criteria—that's three in four who are missing out. This highlights a critical gap in our health system that the government has an opportunity to address. The biggest fear associated with DNA testing is whether life insurance companies can discriminate based on these results. I welcome the government's legislative ban announced in September—this would ensure Australians can undergo genetic testing without insurance concerns. That legislation hasn't been introduced as yet but, hopefully, we will see that in the near future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has also recognised the potential of genetic testing, and recommended monitoring of the outcomes of the DNA Screen study, which also explores future investment in population-scale genomic testing and screening. We should heed this call. By expanding genomic testing and making it accessible to a broader population we can detect these diseases earlier, manage risks proactively and save lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we need to prepare our health system in order to meet the increased demand that population-wide genetic screening will bring. We must strengthen the infrastructure for downstream services and risk management in order to ensure that high-risk individuals receive timely and appropriate care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adult preventative genomic testing represents a significant opportunity. I mentioned the Monash study. Of the 10,000 participants, 24 were from my electorate of Braddon, and one of the 202 high-risk individuals lives in our region. Disease does not discriminate. This investment shifts us from reactive to preventative care, empowering individuals to take control of their health. I call on the government to implement— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  This Albanese government supports expansion of genetic testing to improve the early detection of diseases in Australians and help them quantify their risk and modify it through lifestyle choices or medical interventions. As an indication of support for genetic testing, in September this year, we announced a landmark reform driven by the advocacy of Dr Jane Tiller, who is present with us, and colleagues at Monash University as well as community advocates like Rare Voices Australia. We did this to end the ability to discriminate against an adverse predictive genetic test. As a result, we have banned its use in life insurance. Underwriting this change will give Australians the confidence to undertake genetic testing without fear that it will impact their ability to access financial security through life insurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rare diseases affect two million Australians, accounting for eight per cent of the population. Actually, rare diseases collectively are not that rare. Eighty per cent of these diseases are genetic in origin, with the rest being non-genetically linked cancers, infections and autoimmune diseases. That should give you an indication of the potential for DNA screening against an entire population. However, delayed diagnosis of rare diseases is the norm, and this includes those cancers associated with these genetically related problems. In fact, 30 per cent of adults have a diagnosis delayed by five years. This in turn leads to poor outcomes, exacerbating stress and anxiety as well as the financial cost felt by patients and carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ovarian cancer is an example. Due to the nonspecific symptoms, like abdominal bloating, and a lack of an early detection test, around 70 per cent of ovarian cancers are diagnosed late. Consequently, the average five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer in patients is quite poor at 49 per cent, compared to 92 per cent for breast cancer, 84 per cent for uterine cancer and 74 per cent for cervical cancer. DNA Screen at Monash University tests for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, Lynch Syndrome and heart disease. With funding of $3 million, DNA Screen has tested over 10,000 18- to 40-year-olds. Two per cent were found to be at high risk—one person in my electorate of Higgins. DNA Screen now proposes to scale this up to 100,000 people, requiring approximately $50 million in investment, as a precursor to a nationwide screening program. This is truly an ambitious plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess the questions raised are also significant. Arguably, screening is the easiest part of the equation, but how then will the results be managed? We don't have enough genetic counsellors, and GPs do not have the time nor the expertise to fill this gap. Do we have the diagnostic capacity from imaging as well as the radiologists, pathologists and proceduralists to perform the inevitable scopes or biopsies on these patients? We would need to ensure that the downstream impacts on the healthcare providers, the health workforce and the hospital system are manageable. These and other questions are now being dealt with by the health department as well as DNA Screen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is investing in genomic research and genetic screening in Australia. $66 million is going towards genomic research, including testing of 500 children with cerebral palsy. We are looking to screen 1,000 patients with Parkinson's disease. We're looking to test for more rapid diagnosis and identification of epilepsy in infants and to improve blood pressure treatment according to a patient's genetic profile. Each of the 25 projects will receive up to $3 million in funding, and in August this year Assistant Minister Ged Kearney announced that $5.5 million will be going to establish a newborn screening program for illnesses at birth, including haemophilia, cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Australian Cancer Plan, the Albanese government wants to improve cancer care in Australia. Genetic testing has great potential in early detection of a range of diseases and in breaking the back of delayed diagnosis for rare diseases as well as rare cancers. Whatever model is finally adopted needs to be equitable, above the postcode lottery, and within the capacity of the healthcare workforce to meet the needs of these patients. It must also be cost effective to ensure that taxpayers get bang for their buck.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I rise to lend my very strong support to this motion and emphasise the amazing potential of genetic screening to help us tackle cancer and other diseases. By implementing proactive, populationwide genetic screening, we have an unprecedented opportunity to identify Australians at high genetic risk for certain diseases before the symptoms emerge, providing a pathway to better prevention to save lives and significantly reduce healthcare costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People who carry specific genetic markers, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, face up to a 70 per cent risk of breast cancer, often at a younger age, and these cancers are also typically more aggressive. Another example is Lynch syndrome, which leads to a 50 per cent lifetime risk of bowel cancer in both men and women. For those with these genetic markers, much earlier and more frequent screening, such as MRIs or annual colonoscopies, is necessary to catch diseases at their most treatable stage. By adopting a more widespread genetic testing approach, we will not only save lives but also save taxpayers and the health system a lot of money in the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must acknowledge the work of Monash University, which continues to illustrate the importance of DNA screening and a more equitable approach for all Australians. Again, it's nice to see you here, Dr Tiller, in our gallery. Of the over 10,000 young adults tested in Monash's DNA Screen pilot, around two per cent were found to be of high genetic risk for cancers and heart disease. This is not rare. It equates to about one in every 50 Australians, a significant number of whom would not have been eligible for existing testing due to restrictive criteria. At least 42 participants in this study came from my electorate of Leichhardt, and one of the identified high-risk individuals is also from my region. This reinforces the reach and relevance of this issue across all of our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the powerful evidence in favour of proactive genetic screening, the current approach remains largely reactive, with testing often occurring only after someone has been diagnosed with either cancer or heart disease. This is a missed opportunity to keep people healthy, out of hospitals and actively participating in our workforce. By shifting to a proactive, preventive model we can empower Australians with the knowledge they need to safeguard their health and to alleviate strain on our healthcare system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure it's very clear now that this information that we can unlock through genetic testing is quite powerful, and we should be mindful that it should be used only for the benefit of Australians. I commend the government on its recent announcement regarding its intent to ban the use of genetic test results in life insurance underwriting. Without this protection, too many Australians fear genetic testing, worrying that a high-risk result could affect their ability to secure insurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Assistant Treasurer has previously confirmed the government's intention to pass this legislation within the current term. If we're going to make this a reality, you really need to get a move on this very, very quickly. I urge the government to keep their promise to protect Australians. Let's get this legislation drafted and bring it into the House without any delays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic modelling from Monash University has also illustrated that the widespread adaptation of a proactive genetic screening approach in Australia would be very cost-effective, at a price that could soon be achievable for as little as $400 per person. It's a very small price to pay for such a significant benefit. It would represent a unique opportunity to bring our healthcare system into the 21st century. This is not about gene editing or designer babies; it's about practical, evidence based interventions to identify those who are at risk of cancer and other diseases and provide them with the preventive care they need. I certainly commend the member for Braddon on this motion, and I look forward to accelerating the progress on this very important issue.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  Our government's commitment to advancing preventive health care is steadfast, and it's grounded in our belief that every Australian deserves access to our world-class healthcare system through their Medicare card, not their credit card. As a government, we absolutely recognise the promise genetics and genomics hold in transforming how we prevent, diagnose and treat disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are taking significant steps to ensure that these scientific advancements remain a source of empowerment and not of discrimination. A prime example is Minister Jones's recent announcement of a total ban on the use of adverse genetic testing results in life insurance. This is a landmark decision that ensures Australians can seek clarity on their health risks without fearing discrimination by insurers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this matter, I'd like to share a story from a constituent in Bennelong who contacted me throughout this process. I'll respectably refer to her as Jane to protect her medical privacy. Jane's experience illustrates how deeply these issues impact Australian families. After losing her parent to cancer and watching her close relative battle terminal ovarian cancer, Jane chose to undergo genetic testing for the BRCA2 mutation. Her motivation was clear—to give her three young children the gift of knowledge and the possibility of preventive action. Jane make this choice out of love, seeking to empower herself and her children with information her own mother ever had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, Jane was faced with an unexpected and heartbreaking choice. She was informed just before her testing that taking the genetic test could impact our children's ability to obtain life insurance in the future. Jane was warned that the results of her test, meant to empower her children, could instead become a barrier to their future financial security. This was devastating news to a parent who would do anything for her children. It is totally unfair that someone who took proactive steps to manage her family's health risks should face a decision where vital knowledge comes at the cost of her children's future security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Minister Jones's recent announcement banning the use of adverse genetic testing results in life insurance is so significant. People like Jane and her children will no longer have to face these difficult choices in seeking genetic information just to protect their own health and the health of their children. This ban sends a clear message that genetic testing is a tool for empowerment and not a tool to discriminate. Australians like Jane will soon be able to pursue testing and take preventive steps without fearing that it will limit their children's opportunities for security later in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Genetic screening offers benefits beyond individual health. It has the potential to reduce the financial strain on our healthcare system by identifying at-risk individuals before conditions develop, saving costs associated with late-stage disease treatment. The government also recognises that the benefits of genetic screening extend beyond individual health outcomes. By identifying high-risk individuals early, our governments can alleviate some of the strain on our healthcare system. Preventive health measures save lives, but they also reduce the long-term costs of treating advanced disease. Health economic modelling consistently demonstrates that preventive interventions lead to significant cost savings. This approach frees up resources to address other critical areas within our healthcare system, making it more resilient and responsive to Australia's needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By expanding genetic screening, we can build a future where the healthcare system is both more sustainable and better prepared to address unique health risks in our population. Organisations like pathology Australia are essential partners in our preventive healthcare efforts. Their work ensures that Australians have access to reliable diagnostic and preventive services, including genetic testing. Pathology Australia's role exemplifies the importance of collaboration in creating a healthcare system that is accessible, comprehensive and proactive. By working together with such organisations, we can strengthen our diagnostic pathways and enhance Australians' access to life-saving information. As a government, we are committed to ensuring that our investments in preventive health are aligned with protecting the rights of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Genetic testing can be a transformative tool, empowering Australians to make informed choices about their health, but this power must come with a guarantee of fairness and protection. The recent ban on genetic discrimination is a good step forward. We'll continue working alongside experts like Dr Tiller here and all the work she's done. I commend this motion's call for expanded genomic testing and research.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I thank the member for Braddon, my good friend and colleague, for moving this important motion, which we discussed earlier in the year within the coalition. I particularly commend the efforts of Monash University, through DNA Screen—a study funded by the Medical Research Future Fund—led by Professor Paul Lacaze and by Dr Jane Tiller, who is in the gallery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With some pride, I must add that it was the former coalition government in 2021 that awarded $2.97 million through the MRFF for this study, searching initially for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome. A key takeaway point for me, as the shadow assistant minister for regional health, is responsibility within the Nationals for federal health policy, which, in large part, is about primary and preventive care, as the states generally manage but don't fully fund acute care. This is the profound potential for DNA Screen to promote preventive health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the motion reads, it's very encouraging that so many young people have participated in DNA Screen's trial. The more we encourage all generations, particularly the younger generation, to change the culture around personal health the better. We, in the slightly older generation, might spend more on upkeep of our homes, motor vehicles or other assets than we do on our own health. Even the money some spend on private health cover may be more motivating as to being able to quickly address urgent care situations, than as to engaging with preventive care available under private health policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Primary and preventive care is also very important in regional Australia, due to the lack of urgent care locally—that is, the distance you have to travel, which is, in some cases, hours, to actually get urgent care. Screening can help identify health problems well before they become apparent and reduce the need for regional patients to be away from home for weeks or months on end for treatment because disease has been picked up too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This pilot program, if funded, would potentially see saliva testing kits sent out to homes. As shadow minister, I hope that regional Australians will be able to send those test kits in and be on the same status as urban Australians. The last thing that we want from a program is an outcome that exacerbates what is already a dire disparity between urban and non-urban Australians' health outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the advocacy of Dr Tiller for some time on preventing life insurance companies from discriminating against those who have genetic screening. It is pleasing that the government has committed to move on this issue, and we will consider this further in the coming months. Certainly the uptake of screening will improve if people do not fear negative outcomes on life insurance from being screened in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to note that it seems very odd indeed to punish people for taking preventive care steps. Why would you disincentivise discovering risks by making it harder for people to access life insurance? Surely, where there is risk, there is a cost threshold to manage that risk. The fact that insurance companies were looking to not insure people if they had DNA markers is disgraceful, and I am pleased that this will be stopped.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  Genetic screening sounds like something out of science fiction. For the more suspicious amongst us it can even sound Orwellian. But it's certainly part of our future, in one way or another, and that means we have to be on both our intellectual and our moral toes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Genetics and genomics have enormous potential to shape the way we prevent, diagnose and treat illness. They are, I think, a power for good. I received a heartfelt note from Ms Troth, whose family, thanks to screening, identified a CHEK2 gene mutation, which means that within her family there is double the chance of developing a range of cancers, such as breast, bowel and ovarian. The legislative actions we're taking will mean that the Troth family and others will be able not just to engage in screening but to take the necessary preventative health actions without facing financial discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has provided $3 million, under the Medical Research Future Fund, for the DNA Screen pilot study, led by Monash University. This study is offering free DNA screening for high-risk hereditary disease gene variants to 10,000 young Australians. Over 20,000 people registered in the first three days—double the allocation—and there are 30,000 registrations to date. DNA Screen updates the Department of Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Health and Aged Care. The discussions and the work have considered an enormous range of issues. We have been sensitive to the dangers of discrimination based on adverse predictive genetic testing results, and our government has committed to banning their use in life insurance underwriting. We don't want people to be frightened away from testing that could ultimately save their lives by the fear that the information could be used to their financial detriment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're ensuring that medical practitioners are enabled to help people everywhere in preventing, diagnosing, treating and monitoring heritable conditions. We did this by the means that work best: we consulted and we listened. We received more than a thousand submissions, and 97 per cent of them supported a total ban on the use of results in a way that threatens the availability of life insurance. In five years time we'll look to review the ban, just to make sure that there are no unintended consequences. That, of course, is what responsible governments do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're proud to note that the Council of Australian Life Insurers have declared their full support because they see this as good for Australians, good for government and good for industry too. This is what happens when you strive to take people along with you, as the Albanese government does, rather than trying to sow discord. Notwithstanding the coalition's failure to act in this area while in office—something we saw across so many portfolios—I hope that this motion signifies that our legislation will have broad support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note I want to express my gratitude to Dr Jane Tiller, of Monash, who did so much to enlighten us in not just this area but broadly and who continues to advocate fiercely for people who suffer from genetic conditions. The report <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Genetics </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Life Insurance Moratorium</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">monitoring the effectiveness and response</span>, known as the A-GLIMMER report, delivered last year, alerted us all. It found that genetic discrimination was occurring in life insurance and was indeed deterring people from seeking testing and engaging in what could be life-enhancing research. I congratulate Jane on being named as a finalist for Research Australia's Advocacy Award.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to genomic research continues. Under the Albanese government, a further $66 million has been invested, along with $5½ million for the screening of newborns for genetic disorders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also committed, as we are in all aspects of life, to equitable access. All Australians must have access to methods which are critical to tackling disease prevention. Investment in prevention in all its aspects is vital to sustainable healthcare systems and to national wellbeing. Healthy children are much more likely to be healthy adults, and people who have received sound healthcare advice are much more likely to live into healthy senior years. That is why we are committed, as a Labor government, to strengthening Medicare. Every time the coalition is in government, Medicare suffers damage and neglect. The repair job is underway, and this week we can see that our investments are starting to work. We won't ever give up on it. We're expanding the network of Medicare urgent care clinics across the country. I think it's up to 75 now—it's hard to keep track—though we only promised 50. There are new bulk-bill clinics that are open seven days a week with extended hours. We're making a bigger than ever investment in bulk-billing, which does take a hit every time the coalition takes office. This new investment is helping more than 11 million children under 16, pensioners and concession card holders to see doctors free of charge. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  Preventative health care, through genetic screening and testing to determine risk factors present within patients, has the potential to save lives. That aspect of these practices alone has meant research in this area could have enormous value for our country. This is something which the member for Braddon understands and for which I commend him. It's something the Albanese Labor government values too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want Australians to be in a position where they can identify their genetic risk of developing serious illnesses, such as types of cancer and heart disease, before these conditions develop. We want this because lives and livelihoods are profoundly affected by diagnoses of cancer and other debilitating, rare conditions on a daily basis in this country. Cancer alone is estimated to have accounted for three in every 10 deaths in Australia in 2024. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't need to be said that such illnesses can be absolutely shattering for individuals and their families. I draw on personal experience in making that statement. Cancer has reached into my family's lounge room on a number of occasions and into my workplace, where I recently lost one of my best mates. My former boss, Ian Smith, lost his fight with bowel cancer back in July this year. I also think about my cousin, who failed to reach his 40th birthday. He was struck down with leukaemia, cruelly, leaving behind his wife and four children. Breast cancer has hit my family on a number of occasions, most recently with my sister-in-law, Marta, taking her in her mid-30s. I also had the misfortune of losing my father seven years ago, at the back end of what was a complicated heart condition. He subsequently was found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm. It's something that can be genetically linked and something I have to go and get an ultrasound for every two years, to make sure I don't have one. It's something that I and my two sisters have to do to make sure that we keep ourselves in good health. What happens when you don't have access to these types of tests is that you can be walking around quite blind to the fact you have something wrong, and the inability to have it treated in a prompt way may cut your life short.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Experiences like mine are felt by families nationwide. There are not many across this country that haven't been touched in some way by one of these diseases. That is the reason we provided $3 million to the DNA Screen pilot study, led by Monash University, under the government's Medical Research Future Fund. If there's an opportunity for just one Australian to detect such an illness early and prevent a form of cancer or rare disease from becoming life limiting, that is worth researching, and I'm proud to be part of a government that's providing the funding to do so. As the member for Braddon rightly points out, the pilot attracted much interest, with 20,000 young Australians registering in the first three days alone. Of those who've been tested under the pilot so far, two per cent have returned a result indicating a high genetic risk of serious illness. So already the future wellbeing of the tested individuals who've been found to be at high risk is much more secure because of this research alone. It's exciting, to say the least, and it's why our government continue to engage warmly with the team at DNA Screen as it progresses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Related to the preventative measures in improving Australian health is an unfortunate by-product that has been termed 'genetic discrimination' within the insurance industry. This refers to an increase of life insurance fees or outright rejection of a life insurance claim where an individual has an identified genetic risk to their health, and it's a damaging practice. It effectively charges individuals for taking preventative steps to look after themselves, and it has the subsequent effect of people being discouraged from taking genetic tests, because they want to avoid a price hike. Under these practices, a test which could save a life suddenly becomes a cost-benefit analysis for Australians. It isn't something a person should need to consider when taking that step. Genetic discrimination has been done away with, the Albanese Labor government having implemented a ban on the practice, because no Australian, no family in this country, should be discouraged from taking care of themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy goes hand in hand with our longstanding commitment to genetic and genomic research investment in this country. We have invested $66 million into genomic research alongside $5.5 million into newborn screening for genetic disorders. As we close, I want to take the time to thank Dr Jane Tiller for her ongoing research.</span>

I particularly want to draw out that the member for Swan has endeavoured to cover a lot of different areas, because, as Western Australians, we aren't just there as the cash cow and the engine room of the nation's economy. We are a people who are very proud of where we come from, but we understand also Western Australia's particular needs, providing the community with levels of infrastructure and support that ensure it is a place where people want to live, work and recreate. Given the size of our state spans from Victoria all the way to Northern Queensland, it goes without saying that the differences are quite vast.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To this end, the member for Swan has applauded not just the efforts of the federal government but also the partnership with the state Cook Labor government around infrastructure for major projects such as the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges, the Westport project development, METRONET—the most significant rail infrastructure build that Western Australia has ever had—and the Tonkin Highway Corridor. There are so many other major works that have to happen in order to move the enormous amounts of resources that are produced from our great state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just the infrastructure projects; we need to have that surety of funding. To this end, we have a federal government that has Western Australia's back. Being an economic powerhouse of the nation, Western Australia needs to be supported. Prime Minister Albanese is on the record as a leader fully committed to supporting Western Australia and its GST deal. The opposition leader has nothing to say on this matter. Leading Liberals like Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and Julie Bishop all cast doubt on his level of support for our GST deal. If we want to be able to ensure that Western Australia continues to drive the Australian economy, we need to ensure that well-paying jobs and security come with the right to our fair share of the GST.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good part of the motion that the member for Swan has introduced points to the critical infrastructure sector. We are a vast state with enormous resources that benefit the entire nation, and the figures differ. The CME suggests that Western Australia contributes some $99 billion to the national economy with some 66,000 directly employed Australians. But the state forecasts are actually even more, with the mining sector contributing about $186 billion to the state's gross product. That as a share of the federal budget is at least six per cent. Needless to say, the numbers are vast, and it demonstrates the importance of supporting the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's Future Made in Australia plan was music to sandgropers' ears. We're working, planning and building for an Australia that does not just provide homes, secure jobs, skilled workers and clean, cheap energy; the plan also unlocks the private sector investment required to be able to succeed in the new global economy. We're working to strengthen the global supply chains for our critical minerals and we're building the resilience of the industry. Of course, we've got a wealth of those critical minerals right under our feet, and they are needed for the solar panels, batteries and wind turbines. Without them, we simply are not able to transition to net zero.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do really excel at extracting critical minerals, but now the challenge is to move into that processing stream. To that end, we're assisting young people to develop the necessary skills, with more than half a million fee-free TAFE places. Here I'd like to pay tribute to the outstanding work being done by my colleagues Madeleine King, the Minister for Resources, and Andrew Giles, the Minister for Skills and Training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are geopolitical challenges impacting the critical minerals sector, and we're working on them, but we're also delivering incentives backed by industry, such as our production tax incentive. The $17 billion production tax incentive for critical minerals processing will grow the resources sector in a way that benefits all of our resource-rich states and, by extension, all of us. In Western Australia alone, it will boost $10 billion worth of critical mineral projects. Western Australia is where it's at, and I'm glad the Albanese Labor government gets Western Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  It's incredible just how out of touch this government is. It's quite clear that, since Labor was elected, life for the vast majority of Western Australian families has got harder, not easier. That's despite those opposite saying life would be easier and would be cheaper under them. Yet here we are again, with those opposite giving themselves an almighty big pat on the back for overseeing this cost-of-living disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Swan, in her motion, calls on this chamber to recognise that this government understands the specific needs of the Western Australian community. Well, I'm sorry, but that is an absurd request, given the Albanese Labor government is making decisions over here in Canberra that, to the detriment of our state, aim to shore up inner-city votes in the eastern states. Look no further than Labor's dreadful decision to wipe out the Western Australian live sheep trade. This is an industry that is unique to Western Australia. It supports some 3,000 workers across regional communities that depend on this trade. How can those opposite come into this place and say they understand WA's needs and they have our best interests in mind when they have turned their backs on our regional communities?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister talks a big game about how often he visits Western Australia. Just a couple of weeks ago he made time to hop on a plane—I'm not sure about the upgrade status—to Geraldton for a photo op with members of the really important crayfish industry, and then he was back on a plane to Perth. Credit where credit is due, I'm very pleased that the crayfish trade with China will resume, and I'd like to note all the constructive efforts of both sides of this House on that matter. While saying that, I'll note that it was reported that the Prime Minister was in Geraldton for just one hour. Obviously, his being in Geraldton for just one hour shows that he believes there's nothing else worthy of his attention in the midwest. Is he coming back, because we've got lots of things we need to talk to the Prime Minister about? It's a real shame that he didn't make the time to meet with our local sheep farmers, who have been targeted by this government, although we shouldn't be surprised, as he has not met once with the Western Australian farmers about this ban on their livelihoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the so-called achievements that the member for Swan has included in her motion. She points to investments in critical infrastructure, and I notice that there is just one example of regional infrastructure, which is the funding for the Outback Way, also known as Australia's longest shortcut. I wonder if the member for Swan is aware that the significant funding for this project was committed to by the coalition government. Seriously, need we thank Labor for not tearing up this investment, like they did for a multitude of other WA projects, including the $48 million for upgrades to the Marble Bar Road in my electorate?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very next line of the member's motion refers to Labor's support for the GST deal, which we delivered whilst we were in government.</span>

                  </a>  Again, patting themselves on the back for adopting our policy, it seems the policies that those opposite are most proud of are the Liberal Party's. Of course, the GST contribution provides a great source of revenue for the WA government, but we cannot forget the contribution of our mining and resources sector. This is a sector that has been treated like dirt under the Albanese government. Labor's pursuit of more and more red and green tape is creating further hardship and hurdles for the sector, which has contributed to almost 60 per cent of the nation's iron ore, coal and gas projects having been delayed, disrupted or put on hold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a pipeline of 421 resource and energy projects, with an investment value of more than $525 billion. Almost 40 per cent of these projects are in Western Australia, so they are WA jobs that this government is putting at risk. We are a mining state in a mining nation. It's simple: we won't be able to fund the essential services like Medicare and the NDIS, build the hospitals in Sydney or, indeed, the roads in Melbourne without a strong mining sector. This is a point those opposite fail to understand, as they make it harder and harder to get projects off the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australians are not mugs and we understand that Labor will attempt to pay us lip-service but, when push comes to shove, they will sell our state out if it means they have a better chance to hold off the Greens over in the east. At the next election, there will be a stark contrast between the Labor government, who has betrayed Western Australian farmers and industry, and a coalition who unashamedly backs Western Australia. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I thank the member for Swan for the motion. I rise today to recognise the unwavering commitment of the Albanese Labor government to the unique needs of Western Australia. This commitment is not just a statement; it is a series of actions that reflect our dedication to fostering growth, innovation and prosperity in our great state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a diverse and vibrant region, rich in resources and potential. Our government's focus on addressing these unique needs is commendable, ensuring that every corner of our state has the opportunity to thrive. One of the most significant areas where we see this commitment in action is the critical minerals industry. This sector is not just a cornerstone of our economy; it is a gateway to a sustainable future. The world is rapidly transitioning towards renewable energy sources, and Western Australia is poised to be at the forefront of this revolution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lithium is essential for battery production, and with the increasing demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage solutions, demand for the material is set to soar over the coming decades. The critical minerals industry is facing challenges however, including market manipulation and monopolisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government understands these issues, as well as the importance of supporting our emerging critical minerals processing industry in Australia. Also, International Graphite's battery anode material project represents another significant step forward. Graphite is vital for battery technology, and investing in local processing ensures we capture more value from our resources while contributing to environmental sustainability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased about the recent announcement of a $17 billion production tax incentive for critical minerals processing. This bold move not only encourages investment but also positions Western Australia as a leader in critical minerals, attracting businesses and talent from around the globe. It is an exciting time for our state of Western Australia as we harness our natural resources responsibly and sustainably.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to our investments in critical minerals, we must also acknowledge Albanese Labor government's commitment to critical infrastructure projects that enhance our communities and improve connectivity across Western Australia. Infrastructure development is essential for economic growth and social wellbeing. The following are some major projects that are set to transform our Western Australian landscape. The first one is the Westport project development, which aims to modernise port facilities, facilitating trade and boosting our economy by accommodating larger vessels and increasing efficiency. METRONET is an ambitious public transport initiative. It will connect communities across Perth and beyond, reducing congestion and making travel more convenient for all residents. The Tonkin Highway Corridor expansion will improve road safety and travel times, linking key areas of growth within our state. The Causeway cyclist and pedestrian bridges will promote active transport options, ensuring safe passage for cyclists and pedestrians while enhancing accessibility. The Outback Way, often referred to as Australia's longest shortcut, will enhance connectivity between remote communities, opening up opportunities for tourism, trade and local businesses. These projects are not merely about construction; they represent a vision of progress, one where every citizen can access essential services and opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to emphasise the ongoing commitment of the Albanese Labor government to the goods and services tax deal for Western Australia. This agreement ensures that we receive our fair share of funding from the federal government. It allows us to invest in vital services, such as health care, education and infrastructure, that are fundamental to the wellbeing of our communities. The continuing advocacy for this deal reflects our understanding that equitable funding is essential for addressing disparities across the regions. It empowers us to make strategic investments that uplift all Western Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We face many challenges: climate change, economic shifts and social inequalities. It is imperative that we respond responsibly and effectively. I call upon the opposition to unite with us in supporting these vital initiatives. By listening to community voices and prioritising their needs we can make sure no-one is left behind and secure a sustainable future for Western Australia.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  There is one question Western Australians need to answer: have you actually been better or worse off since Labor came to government in 2022? In WA, we know Labor has delivered higher costs of living, higher mortgages, 12 interest rate rises, higher costs of doing business, shortages of housing and rental properties, and shortages of skilled workers in spite of record immigration. Western Australians are paying higher prices, higher taxes and higher mortgage repayments because of Labor's homegrown inflation. Labor is trying desperately to manipulate headline inflation through taxpayer funded subsidies, subsidies that will be paid for by current and future generations of WA taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over and above this, let's consider how Labor is deliberately and actively damaging Western Australia by closing the live sheep trade. As a farmer myself, I well understand why WA farmers know that the Labor government believes that we are expendable, that we simply don't matter. Axing the live sheep trade is a prime example. We Western Australians know that Labor is totally east coast, city, elite, activist focused, dictating to and actively sacrificing WA farmers and our communities. Every family and farming business matters in regional communities. That is something that Labor either doesn't understand or couldn't care less about. Each one of these businesses keeps their community going by buying locally from other small businesses and contractors. Livestock transporters, shearers, truckies, stock agents, schools, vets, mechanics and other small businesses are the lifeblood of rural and regional Australia. They're the ones that support our local volunteer emergency services, and sporting and community groups. Every local dollar that circulates in these communities helps to keep the whole community sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How about the dreadful financial and personal stress this is forcing onto our farmers and their families? Labor couldn't give a damn in WA. When I watched the then Labor ag minister smiling as he held up Labor's document to end live exports, I thought, 'How disgusting for WA farmers—an eastern states federal Labor minister celebrating an end to a farming industry in WA.' Labor is coming after WA farmers one sector at a time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just WA farmers; it's also our beautiful, productive regional communities. Labor is planning to build hundreds of around 300-metre offshore wind turbines in our iconic Geographe Bay, off my electorate. Labor will ride roughshod over our south-west by literally forcing our communities to bear the massive burden of Labor's intermittent, unreliable renewables-only obsession. Like the live sheep closure, Labor is targeting Western Australians once again. Its ruinously expensive green offshore wind dream is our regional communities' worst nightmare. Picture 4,000 square kilometres of hundreds of these 300-metre turbines in our pristine Geographe Bay. What a dreadful and appalling blight on our marine environment in an area that is a major tourist and recreation attraction in the south-west of WA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People come to enjoy the sheer beauty and the amazing marine recreational area. They don't come to see visual pollution or bird-killing 300-metre wind turbines or the prospect of significant damage to our marine life. With each one of these actually needing exclusion zones, no-go zones, you can imagine the amount of ocean that won't be able to be enjoyed by our local people and tourists alike. With hundreds of turbines, these exclusion zones will excise and lock out all other activities all around the areas of the bay, with hundreds of kilometres of undersea cable, substations and onshore transmission lines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course Western Australians will be guaranteed to pay more for their power because of the enormous cost of offshore wind. According to a CSIRO report last year, it's at least three times more expensive than onshore wind and the massive turbines will only last 25 years before they have to be removed and replaced—or south-western WA will be left with rotting wind towers in our pristine Geographe Bay. The community says no, and the coalition has said no. Our south-west and WA can be confident there will be no wind factory in Geographe Bay under a coalition government. That's in contrast to a Labor Government that continues to punish WA and our critical mining and resources sector, with changes around industrial relations, the nature positive act, layer upon layer of red and green tape, and uncertainty over approvals. They are continuously biting the hand that feeds them that is Western Australia. We on the coalition side will stand up for Western Australia every day of the week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Newtown Park has a fascinating history. You can walk through it today, and it has a beautiful rose garden, the Queensland State Rose Garden. But, on those grounds, the 11th Light Horse Regiment trained. They famously followed the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments in the ride on Beersheba. It's a proud part of our legacy, and the training grounds are still visible there in Newtown Park. Throughout World War II it was again a camp for US and Australian servicemen as they prepared for the awful days ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today it serves a very different part of our history. Today, you can walk through Newtown Park and see groups of Ezidi Australians—young kids playing soccer and volleyball, groups of elderly women sitting together in a circle talking and the Ezidi men always walking and talking all the way around the park. I'm there playing basketball with my kids. The challenges of languages and of cultures clashing together played out in this historic park in the centre of regional Australia—it's something I'm intensely proud of, that Toowoomba has become a place of refuge for these people. It's a legacy that I think the Liberal Party can reflect on with some pride, thinking back to those terribly dark days when the Ezidi people were being horrifically treated in their homeland by ISIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When speaking of the 10th anniversary of that terrible historical event, I don't want to go into the depths of what they faced. It's sufficient for us all to note that their homeland became their hell. I'm very proud that Australia was in a situation to be able to reach out to people in desperate need and extend the hand of friendship and love and give them a new home here in Australia. In Toowoomba, we became a place of refuge. What has been extraordinary is that, since those first days, we have had secondary settlement come to Toowoomba in waves. We now have somewhere around 7,000 Ezidi people living in Toowoomba, the largest regional capital. It's great to see that they have chosen this as their home and they have found safety, security and friendship in our great city. I think this is an important legacy for us to reflect on on this side of the parliament. It was under Tony Abbott that that decision was made. It was on our leader Peter Dutton, as our then immigration minister, to ensure that those people came here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what's important for us in acknowledging the extreme trauma that the Ezidi people went through is that, having taken these new friends into our hearts and made them part of our nation, we continue to help their settlement. We are talking about a cohort of new Australians who experienced trauma far beyond what the human mind can imagine. In remembering those days, I think it's important that we set ourselves forward for what the next 10 years will look like, to make sure that we reach out to the Ezidi Australians and say, 'Hey, look, we understand this is going to be tough—this has been tough—and we'll continue to find ways to work with you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been very happy that, in my community, my predecessor, John McVeigh, sought specific funding to help with that resettlement process, understanding that many of these people did not have a written language and did not have an understanding of how to integrate into our society. The mechanisms that we might use for other cultures were not working, and we had to find new ways to make that work. Having brought them here, it's our responsibility to make sure that they do settle and they are given every opportunity. I've continued that fight to continue that funding. I think it's important to point out that, when we extended that hand of friendship, it was with very strong borders. It was with a view that the full processes would be applied. I speak to particularly the younger Ezidi who remember going through that process and how tough it was, sometimes going to a third country and waiting over a year for their visas to come through and how tough that process was but how grateful they are to be with us. I think it's important on this anniversary to say: after all you've been through, we are grateful you've joined us. You've made us a better country. Your hard work and effort is something that we reflect on with great pride. I look forward in 10 years time to saying how well you've settled.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  I preface my comments by saying that I am speaking here in the place of the member for Wills, who can't be here today, for family reasons. He very much wanted to put on the record his support for the Yazidi people both here and also in the Middle East. I just wanted to put on the record that he is a champion of human rights issues in that part of the world and more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure that the comments I make today are broadly in alignment with what he would have said. I also acknowledge the mover of the motion, the member for Groom, and just say that it's important as local members that we bring to this chamber the issues that are important to groups in our community who have gone through very difficult times. In my community there are not a lot of people of Yazidi background, but there are people from the Chin community and the Tigrayan community who have been through very similar experiences. So I want to acknowledge the sentiment, and I very much support the fact that the Yazidi community in Australia and, in particular, in Toowoomba, which has the largest such community, deserves acknowledgement of all they've been through, as well as support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My understanding is that there are around 700,000 Yazidis around the world. Most are living in northern Iraq, in and around Sinjar. I want to make the point that that is a region of the world where, at the moment, there is a great degree of polarisation, a great degree of conflict and, in many ways, a great degree of intolerance. It hasn't always been like that. The Yazidi people have an ancient religion, but one that differs from other religions celebrated in that part of the world, and that has led to tension of late. It is very unfortunate, it goes without saying, that we are going through a period not just in that part of the world but also in the rest of the world where intolerance is leading to the kinds of horrific incidents that we remember occurring 10 years ago. The slaughter of innocent people that occurred in August 2014, when the Daesh attacked the Yazidi people, is something we must do everything we can to prevent. And, of course, we need to provide as much support as we can to the people adversely affected by such acts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the Australian government has continued to support the rights of the Yazidi people to live in safety and security throughout Iraq and Syria. But it has also continued to support people seeking refuge in Australia—people with family connections and people seeking to avoid extremely dangerous situations in northern Iraq or Syria. As the previous speaker, the member for Durack, mentioned, we acknowledge the horrific experiences that people went through a decade ago. They would remain with the many Yazidi people here in Australia, who now live in a much more peaceful and secure environment. But some of those acts will haunt people forever. So it's critical that we continue to support people that have been through such horrific situations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia continues to advocate for the rights of Yazidis in Iraq, and we do this at the highest level. For example, in August 2024, Australia's ambassador to Iraq attended a commemoration in Baghdad and issued a statement to mark the 10th anniversary of the Sinjar massacre. We continue to monitor the Iraqi government's efforts to achieve justice for the Yazidi government. We also continue to advocate, at the highest levels, the importance of preventing violence and hate speech against minorities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also continue to support the Yazidi community through our offshore humanitarian program. Between July 2014 and September 2024, over 7,200 offshore humanitarian visas were granted to Yazidis located in Iraq and Turkiye, focused particularly on Yazidi women—as well as their immediate families—who often endured appalling conditions in captivity under the Daesh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reiterate the acknowledgement of all that the Yazidi people have gone through, and this government and this parliament's continued support for them. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  While I do not agree with all the elements of the motion moved by the member for Groom, I do wish to commend the contributions made by members to this debate, and I commend the member for Groom for representing the concerns of an important community within his electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day of 3 August 2014 was one of unimaginable horror for the Yazidi people living in Sinjar in north-western Iraq. Over the following days and months up to 400,000 people were displaced and countless people were trafficked, kidnapped or killed. Those who survived were forcibly transferred to bordering countries as slaves or were trained to fight, against their will. The United Nations documented that over 5,000 Yazidis were killed and over 11,000 women and girls were trafficked throughout Iraq and Syria. Ten years on, thousands are still missing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the UN's investigative team to promote accountability for crimes committed by Daesh released a report concluding that war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide were committed by the militant group during their 2014 offensive. Since the outbreak of war in 2014, successive Australian governments have provided humanitarian support to the Yazidi diaspora who now call our country home. We recognise the importance of and the need for justice for the Yazidi people. Persecution has been a painful yet consistent theme for the Yazidi. Their resilience means they have survived countless attempts, spanning across centuries, to wipe them and their faith from history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of Australia's greatest attributes are its multiculturalism and its helping of those in need. Australia heeded the call to help, and since 2014 the government has granted thousands of offshore humanitarian visas to Yazidis from Iraq, Syria and Turkiye. The government's offshore humanitarian program has focused particularly on women and children, as well as on their immediate families. The government is committed to the families of those who have resettled in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward a decade from that terrible day in Sinjar and much has changed for those who've settled here. There are regional hubs, like that in Toowoomba in the division of Groom, which is now home to one of the largest Yazidi communities in the country. While we may not agree on everything in the motion being put before the House, I admire the member for Groom for strongly advocating for his constituents in this place. Kurdish Kurmanji, their traditional dialect, is the second-most spoken language in the region. Those who have settled here have not only embraced this new opportunity; they are giving back to the communities that assisted them when they first arrived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who did resettle here, there's an understanding of feeling happy and safe, yet equally, understandably, there's concern for their families and friends who remain at risk of ongoing persecution. Many members of the Yazidi diaspora living in Australia have shared their often-horrifying experiences, and, while opening our doors to them was life changing, concerns linger for the safety of their family members, either missing or unable to join them here in Australia. Stories like these reinforce why the government is providing 20,000 visas through our humanitarian visa program for the 2024-2025 period, ensuring we can permanently resettle and protect in Australia those most in need from around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government fully supports the right of Yazidis to live in safety and security throughout Iraq and Syria. We acknowledge the horrific experiences of sexual slavery, torture, mass murder and brutality experienced by the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria at the hands of Daesh. We stand united with the Yazidi community, and we'll continue to advocate for their rights, and for justice, and to monitor the efforts of the Iraqi government to achieve justice for the Yazidi community following that unthinkable violence in 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government also continues to advocate to Iraq the importance of preventing violence and hate speech against minorities and of implementing Iraq's laws governing the protection of all minorities, with our ambassador to Iraq recently attending a commemoration in Baghdad and issuing a statement to mark the 10th anniversary of the Sinjar massacre. In that statement, the ambassador noted that 3 August was 'the 10th anniversary of the Sinjar massacre in Iraq, which marked the beginning of a series of atrocities suffered by the Yazidi people at the hands of Daesh. The Yazidi community faced unthinkable violence, forced displacement and sexual violence. We mourn those lost and honour those who carry forward their memories and culture. We admire the resilience and strength of the Yazidi community, including those that now call Australia home.'</span>

When asked about my children, I don't always add Michael and Meaghan, not because they are no longer part of our family and certainly not because I don't think of them regularly, but because I don't always have the ability to talk to people who haven't suffered the loss of a pregnancy through miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal loss. Reactions are wide and varied. In the early days I felt like people shied away from me. I'm sure that was because they didn't know what to say, and for good reason—they just didn't know how to help. Acknowledging the loss and the child by name makes such a difference to a grieving family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ours is a club no-one wants to join, but this year more than 110,000 Australian mums will experience a miscarriage. October each year is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, and Sunday 15 October was Remembrance Day, when families throughout this country light candles to acknowledge the babies who are thought of often but no longer take a place at the family table. Although Australia is one of the safest places in the world to give birth, around six babies are stillborn and two die within 28 days of birth in the neonatal stage, equating to around 3,000 perinatal deaths a year. Sometimes that's what makes the loss the hardest; there are so few of you and you rarely know someone in the same situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are an Indigenous mum or come from a CALD community, you are up to 50 per cent more likely to suffer pregnancy or baby loss. This figure is stubborn and hasn't changed in the eight years I've been in this place. Indeed, the figure has not substantially changed for 30 years. More research is needed. Better access to good, reliable prenatal care is also essential wherever you live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government, through the 2024-25 budget has dedicated $9.5 million to improve care and support provided to women and families experiencing miscarriage and early pregnancy loss. This included $1 million over two years to the Australian Institute of Welfare to undertake a miscarriage data-scoping study. The study will support work to better understand miscarriage and help to improve the support offered to women and their families, because if you don't know what's happening, you can't help. There will be $1.5 million over two years for a national audit of early pregnancy assessment service clinics—improved information can be used by GPs and other health professionals to ensure women experiencing pregnancy loss and other early pregnancy complications are referred to the proper specialist services where feasible. There is $1.5 million to develop miscarriage education and awareness resources, including public awareness and education programs. There is $5.5 million over four years for frontline miscarriage support services to provide evidence-based, culturally safe bereavement care, and support for women and families who have been impacted by miscarriage. Funding of $0.9 million over two years was also announced to continue to monitor and evaluate activities under the National Stillbirth Action and Implementation Plan. This is building on funding from previous budgets, with a continuation of Red Nose Australia's Hospital to Home program, which provides services to more than 2,000 Australian families who experience stillbirth each year. There is funding to deliver high-quality, evidence-based bereavement care for women and families from high-risk population groups that have experienced stillbirth and miscarriage, especially for those from First Nations, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, families living in rural and remote areas, and women younger than 20. This also includes direct bereavement counselling and training for health professionals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are encouraging signs that the research will help families and babies reduce the rate of deaths and miscarriages every year. More importantly, families will feel and be more supported in their journey of loss. To every family whose babies are no longer with them, I share your pain and remember your loved ones and acknowledge them. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion brought by the honourable member for Werriwa. I thank her for bringing this important matter to the attention of the House and also for sharing her personal stories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year, 15 October marks Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. It acknowledges the shared loss experienced by parents, friends and healthcare workers of those little ones lost too soon, whether through miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death or by any other loss. The day serves as a moving reminder of the universal sadness felt by parents, friends and healthcare professionals in the wake of the devastating loss of infants due to miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death or any other tragic event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The joy and excitement that a much-hoped-for pregnancy brings, sadly ends in tragedy and grief for far too many Australians. Every year, 110,000 Australians experience a miscarriage, more than 2,000 experience stillbirth, and almost 700 lose a baby within the first 28 days. The recognition of these numbers underscores the gravity of the issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have, sadly, witnessed friends endure the pain and loss, the absolute cruelty, that a miscarriage can bring. These are mostly endured in silence. Most miscarriages occur within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a period when most expectant mothers are reluctant to share their news. They and their partner often then grieve together but alone, with the loss unacknowledged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day serves as a sombre yet necessary moment for reflection and unity, transcending political boundaries and embodying a bipartisan sentiment. It acknowledges the pain that countless families endure across the nation, emphasising the importance of compassion, empathy and support in times of devastating loss. It's also an important day for the support services available for bereaved families, encouraging open discussion about these difficult topics and creating a sense of connection among individuals who have faced unimaginable grief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My journey with my very premature babies brought me into contact with mothers and fathers suffering the loss of a child at the NICUs at various hospitals, including here at the Canberra Hospital. My husband, Michael, and I were very fortunate, 18 years ago, with our little miracles. However, I will never forget how close we came to a very different outcome. I vowed then that, at any opportunity, I would raise the issue of premature births, miscarriages and also infant loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families undergoing these traumatic events need significant support. This year I was privileged to be able to attend a special memorial service at Woronora Memorial Park at Karinya children's garden. The service was highlighted by music, the lighting of candles and the release of white doves, and by some very courageous keynote speakers. I particularly mention the parents of Rafael, who lost their little son earlier this year. Parents of precious babies lost decades ago said, 'You never get over it. You just learn to live with it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also present at the service were representatives from Bears of Hope. This organisation has a collection of teddy bears available for families who have suffered pregnancy or infant loss, because, for many of those families, they leave hospital with a suitcase instead of leaving with their brand-new baby. So Bears of Hope are there. They have three different types of bears, and they ensure that the family goes home with a package which includes a little bear, so that the family is not leaving the hospital with just their suitcase. The three bears are: Hope, which is recommended for families who have experienced the early loss of their baby, and this is the smallest bear. Sophie is recommended as best for families who have had the opportunity to see and hold their baby, including in circumstances of late miscarriage, stillbirth or loss shortly after birth, and Sophie is the middle-sized bear. Lastly, Xavier is most suitable for families who have experienced the loss of their baby in an intensive care or special care nursery or through infancy; he is the largest bear of hope in their family. I wanted to especially mention this organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loss of a child has a devastating impact on families, causing significant personal, social and financial consequences for parents. We need to continue to recognise and acknowledge that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I'm at the stage of life when a lot of my children's friends are thinking about babies, having babies or trying to have babies. It's a time of great joy to my peers, the grandmothers and grandfathers. But it also means that I'm hearing of young women who are losing babies during pregnancy, and that makes it a time of real sadness and despair for some. While shifting attitudes mean that it's more likely to be spoken about now than when I was young, that doesn't change the pain that the loss brings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one knows exactly how many miscarriages occur in Australia each year, but it's estimated that one in five confirmed pregnancies end in a miscarriage, and that's about 110,000 every year. Miscarriage or early pregnancy loss, which is the loss of a baby before 20-weeks gestation, are the most common complication of pregnancy and can be devastating and traumatic for women, their families and their support people. It's not hard to imagine how it can have lasting impacts on a woman's physical and mental health throughout her life. Devastatingly, one to two per cent of Australian women will experience three or more consecutive miscarriages, and that brings a lot of pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area of health care where there's still a shortage of data and information, as well as still too much silence. I don't think it's a coincidence that a party with more women than men in parliament is building on what has already been done in the past to continue to try and change that. The last budget dedicated funding of $9.5 million over four years to improve the care and support provided to women and families who experience miscarriage and early pregnancy loss. It's things like a million dollars over two years for the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to undertake a miscarriage data scoping study. The study will support work to better understand miscarriage and help improve the support offered to women and their families. There's funding for a national audit of the Early Pregnancy Assessment Service clinics, with the aim of improving information on the EPAS clinics so GPs and other health professionals can ensure that women experiencing pregnancy loss or other early pregnancy complications are referred to specialist services where that's feasible. It's things like $1.5 million to develop miscarriage education and awareness resources, including a public awareness and education program. It's $5.5 million over four years for frontline miscarriage support services to provide evidence based, culturally-safe bereavement care and support to women and families who've been impacted by miscarriage. I hope that through these measures we have a better understanding of pregnancy loss and can better support women and partners experiencing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of this parliament also continues supporting women experiencing stillbirth. Stillbirth can also be a horrible thing for women and their families to go through, resulting in ongoing grief, anxiety and depression, as well as the social and financial impacts. Australia is one of the safest places in the world to give birth, but, even so, around six babies are stillborn, and two die within 28 days of birth, equating to around 3,000 perinatal deaths per year. That's a lot of families who've lost their child. In 2022, there were 297,725 babies born in Australia, and 2,357 of these were stillbirths. While any pregnancy can result in stillbirth, rates remain higher among First Nations women, CALD communities, migrant and refugee groups, women living in rural and remote Australian and women younger than 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has become a world leader in stillbirth awareness and prevention thanks to the work of many previous governments and leads the way in supporting parents and families. But there is still more to do. The evaluation of the stillbirth action plan from a few years ago shows that there have been concrete developments in prevention. Healthcare professionals are more consistent in offering investigations, but we know there's more to do. I know that, across the parliament, there's a deep commitment to ensuring we keep improving in this area. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I want to commend the member for Groom for this very important motion. Banking, as we know, impacts us all. Every Australian and every business is impacted, as are all of our communities. We particularly need to make sure that we have competition in the sector and that we support smaller banks to hold those bigger banks to account. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of regulation that's not thought out, or overregulation, can be crippling in any industry, but particularly in banking. We already know that there are 130 new regulatory changes that banks are having to deal with. Overregulation stifles growth, stifles innovation and stifles productivity. We need to always look to get the balance right in protecting consumers, making sure the frameworks are correct, but not overregulating to cause more harm than good. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we should never forget that overregulation entrenches big businesses over small businesses, because big businesses have the scale to amortise their costs across all consumers, across all of their companies. They also have the resources to invest in more staff to make sure they can be up to date with those regulations, and it actually creates a competitive advantage for those big banks versus small banks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is crucial that we support small banks. One example of small banks that could've been negatively impacted through these changes is the Bendigo community banks. Bendigo Bank plays a huge role in my community. We've got the community banks of Mount Evelyn, Belgrave, Upwey, Monbulk and district, Mooroolbark, Healesville, Woori Yallock and district, Wandin-Seville, Warburton and Yarra Junction district. All of these banks work in partnership with Bendigo Bank, but it's really important to understand they're community led; it's not just in their name. They are led by volunteer boards. I want to thank all the volunteers that give up so much of their time to make sure that the banks are run well and are profitable. They turn up at many community events. I'm lucky enough to spend a lot of time at community events with the volunteer boards from the banks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other crucial roles that a Bendigo Bank plays is giving back to our community. They have given back, over the last 20 years, tens of millions of dollars to sporting clubs, community groups, charities—to those in need. I know, when the Mount Evelyn Football Netball Club were lucky enough to get their rooms redeveloped, it was a partnership between the state and federal government and the local councils. Significant funds from the Mount Evelyn community bank went into making sure the fit-out could be properly done to make sure they had a quality facility, particularly as the growth came through in their women's programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without community banks, our community wouldn't be as strong as it is. That's why we need to get regulation like this right. We have to ensure that they can remain profitable and we have to ensure that they're serving the community. The other thing a community bank will do, which we have not seen other bigger banks do, is make sure they have a footprint in the community through infrastructure—through a physical bank—which ensures those Australians that aren't tech savvy or are concerned about scams can walk into the bank, have a conversation, make sure all of their data is being protected and deal with their transactions as they need to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time that my office was receiving complaint after complaint about the big four banks leaving our community, I stood with pride at the Community Bank Mount Evelyn as we opened their new shopfront, just two weeks ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an investment in funds in our community to make it more open and more engaging, but it was also a signal to the Mount Evelyn community that the Bendigo Bank is there to stay. Every Bendigo Bank across my community, in the Upper Yarra and the Dandenong Ranges—all those banks I mentioned—has a physical location so people can walk in, have a conversation and get the answers they need to their questions. Yes, there is a cost in that. But they see that cost not as something to wash away but as a benefit to the community. That's what they stand there to do. Every time APRA or the government look to make regulation and laws, they need to make sure they get that balance right and allow our smaller community banks to continue to flourish and drive competition in the sector.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  At the start of this contribution, I think it's worth taking a step back and asking why we have prudential regulation. Essentially we have prudential regulation for two main reasons. One is to ensure that financial institutions are operated in a way that is prudent and safe and that those institutions have good governance and appropriate capital holdings. That is of great importance to our community. But the second reason is of even greater importance to our community. There's prudential regulation of our banks so that there is stability of the overall financial system. Prudential regulation requires that banks hold sufficient capital, that banks have suitable governance and that banks undertake appropriate scenario planning. That's because we don't want large organisations being run in such a way that they're at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second aspect, and this is critical to regulation of the financial sector, is that there are systemic risks because banks are interconnected in the way that they operate, because banks, as part of the financial services sector, are interconnected with all other parts of our economy and because banks are so large. So it's absolutely critical for our community that our financial system has a degree of stability. If there was systemic risk in our financial system and if things were not regulated in an appropriate way, we would see things like the GFC bear their ugly heads more often. So APRA's role is absolutely critical, and I think that piece of context is really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the kinds of rules that we talk about in this situation? As I alluded to, the rules in the prudential regulatory space are largely around banks holding sufficient capital, appropriate governance and scenario planning, appropriate stress testing and modelling of risks. The importance of Australia's well-managed prudential setting is borne out in many instances. Most recently we saw, for example, the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank, the carnage of all the devastated businesses left in its wake and the spectre of systemic risk in the US and European systems. We were spared from that. That's just one of a number of examples of the importance of solid prudential regulation by APRA. Key to this is not just that APRA undertakes sound regulation in relation to capital holdings and in relation to stress testing but also that it's independent. This independence of APRA has been instrumental in its success over a long period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other speakers on this motion have pointed to the fact that we need to be cognisant of the importance of small banks and customer owned banks in our system, and I agree with that. In the competition inquiry that I chaired, undertaken by the House Economics Committee, we looked at the important role of small banks and of customer owned banks. We need to have competitive pressure in our system. That is vitally important. But there are balancing acts here that a prudential regulator must undertake. That's why, in addition to bearing in mind the importance of the role that customer owned banks and small banks play, as alluded to in this motion, it is critically important that the prudential regulator has an eye on that systemic risk and the good management of our large banks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The analysis that was undertaken by APRA in relation to some of the non-big-four banks was undertaken in a targeted way. It was undertaken with strong levels of engagement and in the way that you would expect of an independent, robust, rigorous regulator. The motion alludes to the fact that some of the regulation was unnecessary, but I would simply make the point that it is critical that we have fit-for-purpose regulation which balances a number of interests. Critical amongst those is the systemic stability of our system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also make the point that this government, in addition to supporting the ongoing role of APRA, which is reflected in the analysis that it has undertaken in relation to the non-big-four banks, has undertaken significant reforms to reduce the amount of red tape and overlap in our regulatory system—for example, with the regulatory grid initiative, which was something that came up on many occasions in the competition inquiry that the House Standing Committee on Economics undertook. It was something which was supported by the small banks, the medium-sized banks and the customer owned banks. It was also supported by the big four banks, mind you. It was supported by the fintech sector, it was supported by insurers—right across the financial services sector. This government has taken action on that. Let's look at what this government has actually done compared to the 10 years of inaction before that. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion with regard to the APRA requirements for smaller banks. I will start by commending the member for Groom for bringing this motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulation that is proposed is a bit complex, so I'm going to attempt to bring it down to a simpler level. Essentially, in November last year the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, announced it was investigating tighter liquidity and capital requirements for smaller authorised deposit-taking institutions. When it made this announcement, however, APRA did not provide any evidence to justify the change. It seems that APRA had failed to consult with industry, and it provided no evidence to support the change in policy. So, straightaway, when a regulator with the power of APRA conducts an inquiry and there's a lack of consultation in that way, it does raise serious questions. In Australia we have a banking sector that is already subject to considerable prudential regulation, and I think overall it's intelligent in its approach to ensuring the banking sector's resilience to financial market stress. These were the sorts of reasons that were put forward, fairly broadly, as to why these changes to liquidity and things were required. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this is actually about is a power imbalance between our big four banks and our smaller community banks and other mutual societies and organisations. It is not good when we are seeing competition eroded between these organisations. The ones who suffer in the end are, of course, the Australian consumers. We on this side believe strongly in the powers of markets, in the power of entrepreneurial approaches to everything, including the financial sector. In particular, we believe in competition. The changes that have been proposed will result in less competition, less access to capital for consumers and, overall, higher costs for consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we need first of all to look at the very important role that smaller banks and financial organisations play in our community. Because of their very nature, community banks tend to channel most of their loans to the neighbourhoods where their depositors live and work, helping to keep communities vibrant and growing. We heard the member for Casey talk about the number of banks and organisations within his electorate that contribute significantly to all of the activities within the local community, and I note in mine, in particular, their support for local sport and local charities. I think that community banks have a real presence in the community. One of the biggest complaints I receive in my office is about bank closures. But community banks, because they do have a physical presence—they have tellers there, they have real people—provide invaluable assistance to elderly people and people with a disability who may, for example, be unable to access internet banking because they're vision impaired. They may be people with a disability. They may be people that simply do not have internet access; there are still plenty of those in Australia. These are the sorts of very direct services that these community banks provide, and that should be encouraged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community banks also provide very important competition, particularly within the housing sector. At a time when the bank of mum and dad has become the sixth-biggest lender in Australia, we are approaching a situation where whether or not you end up owning a home will depend upon the circumstances of your birth. There is a role, therefore, for these smaller banks to assist, often in circumstances where the larger banks will refuse first home buyers. So it is extremely important to our side that we maintain the strength and integrity of these smaller banks. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  I am a member of the House Standing Committee on Economics and regularly hear from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. APRA does essential work in helping to ensure that our financial system is the best that it can be. Of course, there will always be room for improvement, and part of our role as parliamentarians and committee members is to find ways, sometimes legislative ways, to help APRA improve. That said, it is part and parcel of the role of APRA, as with all such authorities, that it be able to do its work independently. The member for Groom is not a stranger to the work of the House economics committee, given that he is a member of it, and he therefore knows this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The independence of APRA is a part of the trust that underpins its regulation activity, and the government respects that independence. Our well-regulated banking sector enables us to better weather crises. We have seen runs on banks and building societies from time to time, and, when there is a global economic crisis—which also occurs—we need to ensure that we are not just willing to deal with the threat but that we are able to do so. The limitation of liquidity risk is central to APRA's role. The member for Groom used the word 'unnecessary'. None of this is unnecessary—quite the opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023 sent shock waves around the USA and around the world. It was the third-largest banking collapse in US history. Banking systems in different parts of the world experience challenges and crises from time to time. It would be nice to feel that some countries are immune and that a banking crisis somewhere else in the world does not hold lessons for Australia. In fact, the interconnectedness of the global financial system means that contagion is a real and significant danger both within and between national systems. The year 2008 taught us that quite clearly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">APRA are considering changes in the liquidity and capital requirements for smaller banks in Australia and are doing so in the wake of the recent Silicon Valley Bank collapse. It is not a coincidence. Arguably, any regulator in any country around the world which does not review its settings on a regular basis and particularly after a spectacular failure, which is what the Silicon Valley Bank was, is simply not doing its job. The concerns about the Silicon Valley Bank that motivate this review are real. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> describes that bank as having been 'eviscerated' in the course of just two days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">APRA are at the sharp end of our efforts to ensure that our system as a whole is healthy enough to withstand a shock to one part of it—to guarantee that the failure of a bank won't cause a contagion that infects others, including the larger banks. APRA commenced its consultations on this matter a year ago. The proposals involve a narrowing of the gap in requirements between banks of different sizes, and they do not otherwise propose to treat smaller lenders in the same way as large ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, a responsible regulator cannot simply shy away from the need to reconsider its settings, and APRA has not done so in a vacuum. Contrary to the statement in this motion, it received 35 submissions from entities, individuals and industry bodies during the formal three-month consultation period, and reached out to do further work with industry stakeholders. APRA now proposes that banks subject to the Minimum Liquidity Holdings regime for calculating the liquidity requirements will be required to adjust the value of their liquid assets regularly for movement in market prices and that all banks must be operationally ready to provide certain key information regarding their financial position when requesting exceptional liquidity assistance from the Reserve Bank of Australia. These two measures will come into effect from 1 July 2025. Further action will be considered, and, in the meantime, APRA expects all institutions to take steps to improve the diversification of their portfolios to support liquidity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">APRA has here struck a balance between consumer safety, competition and efficiency. The member for Groom doesn't like the balance. The regulator is independent. I am alive, however, to the concern around the need to support competition in the sector and to support our community-owned banks, among others. I note the introduction of a financial sector regulatory initiatives grid by the Albanese government on the back of the House Standing Committee on Economics report into competition. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
