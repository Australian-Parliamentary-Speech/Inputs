                <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter is of the utmost urgency. Let's right now do what needs doing. This is the last chance that we can debate Australia's climate targets before the Prime Minister goes off to Glasgow after being shamed into attending. The Queen herself says she was irritated that leaders like our Prime Minister were intending to not go to Glasgow. It's urgent we debate this matter today, right now, before the Prime Minister further isolates and embarrasses this country on the world stage. It is of the utmost importance that the Senate of this country make a commitment that we will not allow any more new coal, oil and gas. The Pope—get this!—the Pope himself, just last week said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the Pope. Come on! We just did prayers. The Pope sees the urgency of this issue. The Queen sees the urgency of this issue. The Senate surely must see the urgency of this issue and suspend standing orders. It is our chance right now to send the world a message rticle 2 of the Paris Agreement requires member countries to pursue efforts to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Everyone else got the memo—the Pope, the Queen. But our Prime Minister and his junior coalition partner in the government—I don't know what happened to their memo. By suspending standing orders, we can force the government to take the action we need, and fast. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that senators in this place suspend standing orders to talk about this now, because there is no other part of this parliamentary program where we can debate the need to stop any new oil, coal and gas projects. The government's most recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Resources and energy major projects</span> report currently has 72 dirty coal projects and 44 dirty gas projects listed in the construction pipeline. This is unspeakably reckless. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, I just sat here and heard you and everyone else acknowledge country on behalf of the Senate. The Senate acknowledges, just now, that the country is important to our people. We need to suspend standing orders right now because, for First Nations people, climate change is a matter of the most extreme importance. Oil, coal and gas are causing our planet to cook. Our people are being impacted by this right now.

We do believe that this is a matter of utmost importance that the nation is dealing with, particularly in the lead-up to COP26 and the Glasgow meeting, and that this is worthy of the Senate's time for debate. I would also indicate that the motion as it stands, which we also didn't see until it was circulated in the chamber this morning—which goes to some of the questions about the Greens' motives here—isn't something that we would agree to every word of. I'm just reading it on my feet, though; so, again, I would like that on the record. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is some frustration from the Labor opposition about the way the Greens are conducting this. If you were genuinely interested in reaching a consensus or having a debate, I think there would be other ways you would be managing this other than pulling this stunt at the beginning of every sitting morning—particularly talking to us, at least, about what you were planning on doing. I would further submit that it appears to me there's no interest in bringing a consensus position to this chamber about action on climate change. It's not in your political interest to reach consensus. The Greens' political interest is to continue the fight, to continue to stoke division, even with those of us who would share similar views—not exactly the same—but who would want to see effective action on climate change. I would submit that it's not in your interests to see that happen and that we will see the Greens continue to do this and do what they did in 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, and stoke division. It's in your political interest to do that, as opposed to actually dealing with the issue of climate change and reaching a national consensus that will move this country forward, protect the environment and grow the economy. That's not in your political interest. You want to fight with us, you want to fight with the government, and that's displayed by the tactic here this morning. I would submit, if you want real action on climate change: change the government. Don't do it this way—by trying to have a fight with Labor and have a fight with the government. It didn't work in 2010, it didn't work in 2013, it didn't work in 2016, and it's not working now.</span>

The Labor party is exactly correct. It is a stunt. The No. 1 issue here is integrity and the Greens' complete lack of integrity. They have never provided the empirical scientific evidence for their claims. First it was Greta: 'We'll rely on Greta.' Then it became, 'We'll rely on the Queen.' Now, it's, 'We'll rely on the Pope'—and most of them are atheists. My goodness, what are we coming to in this country? This mob is hijacking jobs—manufacturing jobs, coalmining jobs, farmers' jobs. This is an absolute disgrace, because they show no integrity towards the people of this country; they show no integrity towards this parliament, none whatsoever. They tell lies and they make up stuff. </span>

                  </a>  Let's make it clear: I did not call the Queen or the Pope a liar. I called them 'not scientists'. They're not scientists. But this is what the Greens rely on in the fact that they cannot provide the science. The Greens show no respect for science, no respect for humanity, no respect for the people of this country, no respect for hardworking Australians, and no respect for the farmers that they will gut with this 2050 net zero. </span>

I point out that there is no science that backs this up from the CSIRO, and I'll have more to say about that next week. There is no science from the Bureau of Meteorology, none from the Chief Scientist—I can tell you a story about the previous Chief Scientist if there is time—none from the Australian Academy of Science and none from the IPCC. In fact, we had the Labor Party's Kevin Rudd dancing around in 2007 saying 4,000 people in white lab coats endorsed his claim. The reality is that only five academics in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change endorsed the claim of warming, and there's doubt those five were even scientists. </span>

They see a picture of a tree frog, a picture of a koala, a picture of a dolphin, and they say, 'This is the science.' That's it; it's complete rubbish. This has been going on for 11 years, Senator Waters. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LNW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2019. From the outset, I want to make clear that Labor strongly supports the current powers to cancel or refuse visas on character grounds or criminal grounds which exist under section 501 and section 116 of the Migration Act. In 2014 Labor supported amendments to the Migration Act which strengthened the character test and gave the minister the power to cancel the visas of non-citizens and deport foreign criminals. This included people convicted of serious crimes involving violence, sexual offences, weapons offences, breaches of AVOs, and offences against women and children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2014 the government has cancelled thousands of visas under section 501 alone. If non-citizens in Australia commit these crimes, the government can and should cancel their visas. In fact, the extremely broad discretionary powers that already exist thanks to Labor's support mean that foreigners do not even need to spend a day in jail or be convicted of a crime to have their visa cancelled. Furthermore, the minister also has the powers under the Migration Act to refuse the visas of people of bad character before they can even come to Australia. The government can do this if these people pose a risk to the community or have a violent or criminal past. The minister can also refuse a visa if there is a significant risk to an individual who would vilify a segment of the community or incite discord or represent danger to them during their time in Australia. All of these powers currently exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take about the bill. Let's talk about a minister for immigration whose word can't be trusted and a Prime Minister who would rather play politics with domestic violence than get an outcome that would actually make life safer for women and children. First of all, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs is Alex Hawke. Let me say upfront that I like Alex Hawke. I acknowledge that since he took the role of immigration minister he and I have been able to work together on a number of bipartisan initiatives: changes to the distinguished talent visa that would let Quade Cooper and other distinguished Australians—yes, people who should be Australians but currently aren't—be able to call Australia home; and quicker responses to visa applications during the height of the Afghanistan crisis, which is important to many Labor MPs who represent large sections of the Afghan-Australian community. Minister Hawke and I worked together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These examples of bipartisanship in the national interest mean it is all the more disappointing that yesterday the minister for immigration reneged on a deal to work with me over the next two weeks to come up with a plan to get an agreement on this bill. Yesterday, at noon, the minister and I met. We struck a deal to negotiate a final position on this bill and bring it back for the final sitting fortnight of this year. At the heart of that deal, Minister Hawke and I agreed to work on Ministerial Direction No. 90 and to consider changes sought by the temporary visa working group, by the National Advocacy Group on Women on Temporary Visas Experiencing Violence and by the inTouch Multicultural Centre Against Family Violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister sat there in his office and agreed with me that he and I would work together, over the next fortnight, to finalise these changes to the ministerial direction to keep women and children safe. The minister also agreed that he and I would work together over the next fortnight to consider what, if any, changes we might make to the government's own amendment to its own bill to ensure that low-level offending was not inadvertently captured by the bill. That was at noon yesterday. Just before 5 pm, the minister's office called mine and pulled that deal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extraordinary. A minister—a recently promoted cabinet minister, no less—makes a deal to work with the opposition, to deliver real changes that would make a real difference to real women and children who experience domestic violence, and then the minister yanks it just a few hours later. Do you know what Minister Hawke said, when I spoke to him last night? He said that Senator Anne Ruston had told him the bill had to be voted on today. He blamed the Senate leadership for forcing him to renege on that deal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't believe that for one minute. There is only one person who can make a cabinet minister renege on a deal, and that is the Prime Minister. Clearly, the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has yanked Minister Hawke's chain. The minister for immigration made a deal. The minister for immigration entered a real bipartisan negotiation, with a genuine intention to make life safer for women and children who are victims of domestic violence, and just four hours later he pulled it. The Prime Minister pulled his chain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extraordinary. A negotiation, an agreement, in good faith with a cabinet minister, to defer this bill to the next sitting fortnight and to land a deal, was overturned within a few hours. Senator Ruston didn't do this. The Prime Minister did it. I say the minister's behaviour was extraordinary but this is all too predictable from Prime Minister Morrison. He always looks for the political game. The Prime Minister never cares about the outcome. The Prime Minister doesn't care about Australians. The Prime Minister would rather play a political game than get a good outcome for victims of family violence. The Prime Minister overruled this cabinet minister just so he could run a political wedge on Labor and the crossbench. The Prime Minister's leaving domestic violence victims—women and children—behind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know because the Prime Minister's own colleagues have told the media: at the heart of the Morrison government sits a focus group. As Senator Fierravanti-Wells told the Senate this week, it's not the Prime Minister's office it's the 'prime marketing office'. The Prime Minister is so obsessed with serving his own political agenda that he is willing to shame, embarrass and weaken his own cabinet colleague Alex Hawke. I almost feel sorry for Minister Hawke. He's had the rug pulled out from under him. He's been shown to be weak in the cabinet. He's been shown to be a minister who cannot keep his word. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a Prime Minister whose character constantly reveals to the Australian people he is obsessed with politics, and he never delivers. Let's understand this. No matter what the government members might say in this debate today, this bill does not need to be finalised this week. You will hear from those opposite breathlessly declaring this bill is so urgent and vital and we need to get it resolved today or tomorrow; it certainly can't be left to the next sitting fortnight. Let's understand, any claim that this legislation is somehow considered urgent by the government is simply untrue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government first introduced this bill in 2018, more than a thousand days ago. They never brought it to a vote. They reintroduced it after the 2019 election. I wrote to the then immigration minister, David Coleman, in September 2019. I outlined the three things that Labor sought from the government in order to secure passage of this bill—and I never got a response. I didn't hear from Minister Coleman. I didn't hear from Minister Tudge. I am now onto the third immigration minister of this tired eight-year-old government, Minister Hawke, and he only raised this bill with me last week for the first time. We exchanged letters, we had a conversation, we agreed to meet. We met yesterday. We agreed yesterday at noon to a process to settle this bill in the next sitting fortnight, three years since the bill was first introduced, two years after I first wrote to the immigration minister. Finally, an immigration minister in this tired government decides to engage in a genuine constructive dialogue and then, within four hours, welches on his word.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a genuine legislative process by the government; it is a political running gun game, a political ploy from a Prime Minister who only serves his political interests, not the national interests and certainly not the interests of women and children. If this bill was so urgent, the government would have dealt with it when they first introduced it, when I first wrote to them or indeed would have dealt with it genuinely, as Minister Hawke sought to do yesterday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the intent of those opposite trying to pass this legislation? They have brought this forward in an abhorrent gutter politics at its very worst, a new low for this tired eight-year-old government that has plumbed new depths under Mr Morrison. If there has been a single instance of domestic violence in the last 1,090 days that could have been prevented by government actually engaging on this bill constructively with the opposition to get it passed, well then that incident sits on their heads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, this is another effort by Scotty from marketing, the Prime Minister from marketing, to change the narrative to fix up his own failures—his failures on quarantine, his failures on vaccine rollout, his failures to lead. This is a Prime Minister who says 'it's not my job', 'that's a matter for the states 'and 'I don't hold a hose, mate'—too little too late. It is always a political game.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about this bill. First of all, I am a little concerned that the minister for immigration fails to understand he already has the power to deport perpetrators of domestic violence. He fails to understand that women and children who are the victims of domestic violence, whether they are on temporary visas or Australian citizens, who suffer violence at the hands of visa holders, are often at risk. Those women and children, if they report domestic violence, their visa status is also at risk. Sometimes there are Australian children with a mother on a visa and those children are at risk of being separated from their mother. These are real things that happen, and the minister yesterday agreed to work with me to resolve them and four hours later pulled that deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this bill, Labor outlined two years ago to the government the three concerns that we had with this legislation. The removal of retrospectivity, a concern first highlighted by Jason Wood and the government-controlled committee on migration. Jason Wood called for the removal of retrospectivity. Labor also highlighted the concern that low level offending would be inadvertently captured by this bill, a concern the government has acknowledged is real. They are moving an amendment to their own bill. I don't think it goes far enough. Minister Hawke and I agreed yesterday to talk about how we can improve that amendment and we agreed we would work over the next two weeks to fix it but no, as we noted, the minister had the rug pulled out from under him, not by Senator Ruston—I don't believe that for a minute—but by the Prime Minister, who would rather get a political game going than deliver a pragmatic and practical outcome to help keep women and children safe. And Labor raised the concern about the disproportionate effect that it would have on our friends in New Zealand. The New Zealand government has made a submission and appeared at Senate inquiries. The New Zealand government do not just randomly appear at government inquiries but they said that this bill would 'Make a bad situation worse for New Zealanders and therefore New Zealand. This is one area of people-to-people relationships where our Prime Minister—the New Zealand Prime Minister—is pointing out the corrosive effect and we don't want it to be corrosive to our political relationship'. Those are the words of the New Zealand High Commissioner. This bill could put our relationship with our closest neighbour, our dear friends, in jeopardy, which is why Labor has asked the government to review and revise the ministerial direction. And we're not the ones who first raised this: Jason Wood raised it in the government-controlled committee! Jason Wood said that this ministerial direction should be revised to lessen the impact on New Zealanders. These are all matters that Labor raised two years ago and we only heard back from the government this week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, what I say to the minister for immigration is: come back to the negotiating table. You and I, Minister, had a constructive conversation yesterday. You and I discussed how we were going to make life safer for women and children who are victims of domestic violence. You and I, Minister Hawke, discussed how we were going to work together to ensure that this bill did not capture low-level offending, and then you welshed on the deal. Your Prime Minister pulled the rug out from under you. Well, stand up to the Prime Minister and tell him, just this once, that he doesn't get to play a political running-gun game. He should deliver a real outcome, a pragmatic outcome—an outcome that would make women and children safer, and an outcome that would ensure low-level offending is not captured. That's something you have already agreed, Minister, is a problem with your own bill. Frankly, Minister, you should ensure that our close friends and neighbours in New Zealand are not disproportionately affected; you should not corrode the relationship with New Zealand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the minister: come back to the negotiating table. If we get to the committee stage today, I flag that we have amendments to deal with visa privatisation. And, by the way, on visa privatisation: the government has raised a concern about electronic tourist visas in terms of our amendment. I say to the government: fine, we will fix that up—but you should rule out visa privatisation. And we have amendments that seek to deal with New Zealand. Before we get to a final position on this bill, what I say to the government—what I say to minister—is to come back and do your job, mate. Come back and engage in a genuine legislative process. Don't just kowtow and be the water boy for a Prime Minister who would rather play a political game. You know this is wrong, this chamber knows this is wrong and we can do better to make life safer for women and children.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate and Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  We've seen a few government bills that lapsed at the proroguing of the last parliament introduced into this parliament in a better form than they were previously drafted. Sadly, this is not one of those bills. This bill is identical to one tabled in the previous parliament which the government did not bring on for debate in the Senate because it knew it didn't have the numbers to pass it. This legislation, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2019 is police-state legislation. It's legislation that seeks to make a minister of the Crown judge, jury and jailer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is yet another piece of legislation introduced by the government to solve a problem that doesn't exist. This is wedge politics at its absolute lowest. Despite the government's hyperbole and its out-of-control rhetoric on the issue of crime in this country, crime rates in Australia are in fact decreasing. This bill is far more about stigmatising and persecuting particular groups of people than it is about public safety. It's about, of course, throwing a massive wedge at the Australian Labor Party. It's also, sadly, and extremely disappointingly, about increasing the extrajudicial power of the minister for immigration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this government's got a problem with migrants. In fact, just yesterday, this Senate failed to disallow a regulation introduced by this government to nearly double the fees at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for people to appeal certain migration decisions that this government makes. It's pricing migrants out of access to justice. That was just yesterday. And now we have another anti-migrant bill being presented to the Senate today—because there's nothing, or, I should say, there's very little that this government likes more than scapegoating and demonising migrants in Australia. As submitted to the Senate inquiry into this bill, by Mr Sherrell and others, this bill will possibly increase the number of people captured by section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 by a factor of five. Of particular concern is that this will clearly catch people who are highly unlikely to be any kind of an ongoing threat to the Australian community. 'Round them up and kick them out', is the mantra of this government. This is the behaviour of a far Right government, a government in early-onset fascism. This is not the behaviour of a contemporary liberal democracy. This is not the behaviour of a government that believes in the rule of law. This is the behaviour of a government that believes in extra-judicial authority and a government that seeks to actively undermine the rule of law in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the hundreds of visa cancellations made by Minister Dutton under the last tranche of draconian section 501 powers bestowed on him by parliament, most have been made against people of New Zealander backgrounds or Pacific Islander backgrounds—many of whom have spent most or all of their lives here in Australia, most of whom have extended families here and many of whom have little or no support networks in New Zealand or the Pacific Islands. More than a third of all the New Zealanders who have had their visas cancelled under section 501 in recent years haven't set foot in New Zealand for over a decade. New Zealand Prime Minister Ardern appealed to us, during her visit to Australia last year, on the matter of people with stronger ties to Australia than to New Zealand being deported under section 501 as it currently stands and she said this: 'Send back Kiwis, genuine Kiwis. Do not deport your people and your problems.' That is what she said to Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. Unfortunately, deporting our people and our problems is exactly what this corrosive and unfair legislation does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But not everyone ministers have targeted under 501 powers has been of New Zealander or Pacific Islander backgrounds. Some of those targeted have been First Nations peoples of this country—of our country. I remind colleagues that cultural heritage in Australia provides evidence of Aboriginal culture stretching as far back as 80,000 years on this bit of land that is now called Australia. But, apparently, according to this government that is not enough of an argument to allow people who are Aboriginal to stay in Australia. The Love v Commonwealth of Australia; Thoms v Commonwealth of Australia ruling in February 2020, where the High Court quite rightly ruled that Aboriginal people are not aliens under the Constitution and therefore cannot be deported, sought to ensure that such travesties of justice could no longer be entertained by a colonialist government. And I remind folks that this country was stolen, this land was never ceded, and we still do not have a treaty or treaties with Australia's First Peoples. I remind folks that for a large part of this colonial period in Australia, over the last 220-odd years, a White Australia policy existed. So it's with high levels of concern that the Greens note that Ministers Hawke and Andrews, the ministers for immigration and home affairs respectively, are now working to overturn that landmark decision of the High Court. What an absolute disgrace that is! I can assure the government the Australian Greens will have a lot more to say on that when the time comes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this legislation before us today, every permanent resident in this country, even if they've spent practically their whole lives here; who are products of our schools; who've worked in our communities; who've got families here; who've paid taxes here, in some cases for many decades—every one of them—if they have a misdemeanour conviction against their name, will be worried. If this legislation passes, they'll be squarely in the government's crosshairs. No matter how long they've been living in Australia, they will fail the character test if they've been convicted of a designated offence at any point in the past. Even if this conviction happened decades ago while the person was relatively young and even if the person has no recent convictions whatsoever, they can be kicked out of the country under this legislation and not allowed back in. Retrospective laws like this are highly inconsistent with the rule of law, and that's why the Australian Greens are pushing back so hard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, of course, will also impact on the rights and welfare of children and is in clear breach of our commitment to international obligations to the protection of children, like the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Already we've seen existing section 501 powers ripping apart families and separating parents from children and grandparents from grandchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also move the so-called character test away from an individual sentenced based model to an arbitrary penalty model. Rather than being tested against the sentence a judge actually imposed on someone, knowing all the facts of a case, they will now be effectively tried by the government against the maximum length of time a designated offence may potentially be sentenced. Most of the people this bill targets are people who already have significant challenges accessing justice, people who have no access to free legal assistance, and the provisions in this bill will only further restrict their access to justice. It is a blatant targeting of migrants and a blatant attempt to bypass judicial process and the rule of law. The bill does this by lowering an already low bar for refusing or cancelling the visas of noncitizens for reasons such as sharing intimate images, verbally threatening someone, associating with particular people or even holding a rock in a threatening way. I note, after many years across two parliaments, that yesterday the government circulated an amendment to tidy up the definition of designated offences in the bill to provide that the offence must cause or substantially contribute to the physical or mental harm of another person or involve family violence as defined by the Family Law Act, because the government, quite extraordinarily, now seeks to pitch this as a women's rights sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The flagrant disregard for the rule of law aside, if this government really wanted to get tough on domestic violence and do more to protect women in Australia from being harmed and, in far too many tragic cases, being murdered by men, there are far better targeted ways to do that. The Australian Greens would welcome that long-overdue conversation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's also argued that this bill would make it harder for decisions to deport people to be defeated on appeal, and here we go: they've said the quiet part out loud! This is about denying people access to justice, because this government seeks to undermine the rule of law. This government seeks to increase the extrajudicial powers of the minister for immigration, because it doesn't like it when its vindictive, poorly-made decisions are overturned on appeal by the AAT or our court system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, of course, is still smarting after its decision to cancel the visa of a 73-year-old who'd spent his whole life in Australia was overturned after it was unable to prove that the minister had spent more than 11 minutes considering the case. Yes, this man had committed a heinous crime; but for all intents and purposes, the man was an Australian—the product of our society here in Australia, with an Australian education and an Australian family. He is someone who was rightfully tried and sentenced under Australian law, and who did his time in an Australian jail. As Prime Minister Ardern said last year, 'Do not deport your people and your problems.' But that is exactly what this bill seeks to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another shameless power grab to provide the government—and, in particular, the minister for immigration—with powers to circumvent and veto the rule of law, our legal system and our court system in Australia. This is another step down the dangerous road to a prefascist state in Australia, and continues this country down the dark path to being a police state and a surveillance state. This bill is yet another strong argument as to why Australia needs a charter of rights. We remain the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have some form of legislatively or constitutionally enshrined charter or bill of rights. This government uses that gaping hole in our statutes to continue to erode fundamental rights and freedoms that many Australians, including some of my ancestors, fought and died to protect and enhance over the last hundred years. Here we are: this government continues to undermine it and take this country further into prefascism, and further down the dangerous and dark path to a police state. The Greens oppose this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2019. As we move out of an environment dominated by COVID-19, which has unfortunately been characterised by border closures and lockdowns, like in my home state of Victoria, we must once again set our sights on what a return to normal will look like. Considering how well the Morrison government has handled the pandemic, and the fact that our economy is in a position to continue to grow past COVID-19, Australia will once again become an attractive location for foreign citizens to come and visit, whether it be for tourism, for work or to live. Australia is proudly a multicultural nation, and a large part of our success has been built on the back of migrants from around the world who are attracted by some of the great many benefits that Australia has to offer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, unfortunately, not everyone who wishes to come to our shores has good intentions in mind and do not wish to subscribe to the many values that we hold dear, such as respect for the rule of law. The respect for the rule of law is a fundamental value that underpins our society; it is what keeps Australians safe and our nation prosperous. The Morrison government is resolutely committed to upholding these values, ensuring that those who enter our borders share our respect for the rule of law and value the benefits that this brings to our society. Consistent with the views and expectations of all Australians, the Morrison government has no tolerance for criminal behaviour. Those that engage in crime and who pose a threat to Australians in their homes and communities have no place entering our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the number of people crossing the border into Australia again begins to increase, so too will the threats to our security increase. It is not a right of noncitizens to enter into Australia, it is a privilege. This privilege that we bestow on those entering Australia is one that we must carefully manage. Australians expect that we, as the representatives of the people, have in place the right rules and regulations to ensure that this privilege is not taken for granted by those who wish to do us harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has shown that it is resolute in its commitment to keeping Australians safe. We have recently passed numerous pieces of legislation designed to keep Australians safe from foreign threats. They include the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Amendment Bill, the Foreign Intelligence Legislation Amendment Bill, the Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Bill, and the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Sunsetting Review and Other Measures) Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these, I have spoken on recently in this place. They are just a handful of recent examples of legislation, that have passed through the parliament, aimed at keeping Australians safe and free from the threat of violence. Recently, as everyone will be aware, the AUKUS announcement was made. This trilateral defence pact can be seen as one of the greatest achievements in strengthening our national security in recent history. It's one of the greatest steps taken by an Australian government to keeping Australians safe. These announcements outline the Morrison government's achievements over recent times that go towards keeping Australians safe. This commitment is extended today with the bill before us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a welcoming, multicultural, open and cohesive society. At the same time, we need to ensure that we remain safe and secure. The Australian community expects that the Australian government can and should refuse entry to noncitizens or cancel their visas if they do not abide by the rule of law. It must be clear to those who wish to travel to our shores that if they choose to break the law and fail to uphold the standards of behaviour expected by the Australian community, that privilege of residing in Australia will be taken away from them. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Migration Act 1958 to specify that a person who does not pass the character test—that is, they've been convicted of a designated offence—may have their visa cancelled or visa application refused. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The character test, in one form or another, has been in the act since 1992. What the Morrison government is doing is ensuring that this test remains in step with the rest of our society and our values. The Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2019 will ensure that noncitizens who are convicted of certain serious offences and pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community do not pass that character test and are, appropriately, considered for visa refusal or cancellation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill broadens the existing discretionary powers to cancel or refuse visas under the character test. The amendments will allow for discretionary visa refusal cancellation for a noncitizen who has a conviction of a designated offence punishable by at least two years imprisonment. Designated offences include violent and sexual crimes, breaching personal protection orders like AVOs that protect women and children, using or possessing a weapon, or assisting with any of these crimes. These crimes are some of the most serious offences that can be committed and pose a direct threat to our community. The amendments address gaps in the current character test to capture noncitizens who have been convicted of a serious criminal offence punishable by at least two years imprisonment, have received less than 12 months imprisonment for their crimes and pose a risk to the Australian community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By moving the character test onto more objective grounds, the bill will broaden the circumstances in which visas may be cancelled or refused and reduce the likelihood of such decisions being overturned on appeal. The last thing we want is for an individual whose character has been deemed unfit, and who poses a direct threat to the Australian community, to have their visa cancellation overturned on appeal. By focusing on the sentence available rather than the sentence imposed, the bill also captures offenders given sentencing discounts by judges due to plea bargains, guilty pleas or simply to avoid mandatory visa cancellation thresholds. This response to the precedents set out in Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, the ACT and South Australia gives judges discretion to reduce criminal sentences where an offender may be deported due to their offending. As this power is discretionary, the government will have flexibility to focus on serious crimes perpetrated by criminals who pose a genuine and present risk to the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why the Labor Party would oppose this is beyond me. Opposing this bill is essentially saying that you're okay with convicted offenders, who pose a threat to our citizens, walking the streets amongst the community.</span>

                    </a>  You've had two years to negotiate. It shows that the Labor Party is not serious about ensuring that our citizens are safe and that their priorities are wrong. The last time the Labor government was in government, under Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard, they only cancelled and refused a total of 1,128 visas on character grounds. The Morrison government is not okay with this and will pull upon every lever we can as a government to keep Australians safe in their homes and in their communities. The coalition government has a strong record when it comes to combatting crime and keeping our streets safe. Since significant reforms were made in 2014, this government has already cancelled and refused visas of over 9,900 serious criminals. That's almost ten times as many criminals kept out of the Australian community than under Labor. Of the nearly 10,000 cancellations and refusals, offences ranged from murder, child sex and child pornography offences, rape and serious sexual offences against adults, armed robbery, drug offences, kidnapping and other violent offences, including assault, grievous bodily harm, reckless injury, domestic violence, stalking and intimidation, use of a weapon and attempted murder. I think all Australians will agree we don't want those people in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the government cancelled or refused visas to over 320 organised crime figures, including members of outlaw motorcycle gangs. Each one of these visa cancellations or refusals was a great accomplishment and made Australians and our communities safe. This is something we should all be proud of, and we on this side are very proud of it. No-one here should be comfortable with a person who has proven to be capable of horrendous acts to be walking around our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That Labor's position to visa cancellation should be only triggered by the sentence received, rather than the sentence available, shows that they do not take the threats to our community seriously or that they are just simply playing politics. To me, however, it seems as if both those assumptions are true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a fact in 2011, Chris Bowen from the other place, passed laws with coalition support, which focused on the sentence available specifically for where crimes are committed in immigration detention, as opposed to the broader circumstances covered by today's bill. If Labor believed that it was necessary for this type of action to be available for crimes committed in immigration detention centres, it makes very little sense to me as to why they believe it should not be applied to crimes committed in all other areas of our community. Even Mr Albanese, the Leader of the Opposition, when first asked about the bill in 2019, said: 'Is it a good idea to deport people who break the law in Australia? Yes, it is.' Labor's backflip is essentially showing that they are backing foreign criminals over Australian citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the Morrison government is committed to ensuring our communities are safe, and that is why at the 2019 election, as part of our plan to protect our borders to keep Australians safe, we committed to strengthening the character test for foreign criminals even further to enable visa cancellations where a noncitizen has been convicted of a broader range of violent and sexual offences. It was our election commitment. We're keeping it here today. This government intends to keep that commitment and ensure our communities are safe. An Australian visa is a privilege, and our laws must deny that to those who pose a threat to the safety of all Australians. Ensuring that Australians are safe and free from the threat of harm is one of the fundamental tasks that a government must undertake. Without this security, citizens cannot prosper. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

I can see why the minister would be tempted to increase his powers and make his job easier while arguing that it is all for the greater good. But, in the case of this bill, he wants even more freedom than he has now to keep out or boot out anyone who deems of poor character and a possible threat to the safety of fellow Australians. What is harder to understand is why the minister is seeking to set the bar as low as this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, a noncitizen would fail the character test and have their visa considered for cancellation if convicted of a designated offence against another person, no matter how minor the offence and even if they serve no jail time whatsoever. Even if their conviction only results in a fine, they will still fail the character test as long as the crime is punishable with two or more years imprisonment. Designated offences include murder and kidnapping, which are already well dealt with by existing laws, as well as threats of violence, breaching an AVO, processing or threatening to use a weapon, and being an accessory to the offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister argues this bill will target people convicted of serious offences and who pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community. However, existing laws already deal with serious offenders and people who pose a risk to others in the community. This bill will only serve to capture convictions for minor offences—because that is all that is left. It could mean that someone who has lived in Australia peacefully for 30 years as a permanent resident but then does something stupid, like many of us do, like making a verbal threat or getting into a scuffle with another person, could potentially be deported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate inquiry into this bill heard from many submitters who again and again made the point that section 501 of the Migration Act already gives the minister and his delegate very broad powers to refuse or to cancel someone's visa on character grounds. These powers are so broad that section 501(6)(c) is almost a free-for-all. It allows the minister to refuse or cancel someone's visa if the minister decides that, due to their past and present general conduct or criminal conduct, they are not of good character. Under section 501(6)(d), noncitizens also fail the character test if there is a risk that they will harass, molest, intimidate or stalk another person in Australia, or vilify a segment of the Australian community, or incite discord or pose a danger to the community because they might get involved in disruptive or violent activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under section 501(3)(a), there is mandatory cancellation of a visa for noncitizens who have served 12 months or more in prison over their entire lifetime. Visas are also automatically cancelled for anyone convicted of sexual offences involving a child, regardless of the length of any sentence. Otherwise, the minister only needs to reasonably suspect that the person does not pass the character test under existing laws. That visa can then be cancelled if that person fails to convince the minister or his delegate otherwise. They will also have no rights whatsoever to a merits review. If the minister is satisfied that the visa cancellation is in the national interest, they will have no rights whatsoever to a merits review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If that's not enough, under section 116(1)(e), the minister may cancel a visa if the holder poses a risk to the health, safety or good order of the community or the health and safety of an individual. This section allows for the cancellation of a temporary visa or permanent visa once the holder travels outside Australia. According to New Zealand's submission for the identical 2018 legislation, section 116 of the Migration Act was previously used to deport New Zealanders for a breach of restraining orders or one-off assault charges. What more does this minister need?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The migration act already gives the minister broad powers to boot out pretty much anyone who could be deemed a real threat to the community or individual safety. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reality, this bill isn't about making the community safer. It is about making the administration of the existing laws easier. Lowering the bar to ensure anyone convicted of a designated offence against another person that fails the character test takes the hard work out of the process. It provides an automatic and low benchmark. It means discretion is instead focused on when not to cancel or refuse a visa. It will mean these visa cancellations and refusal decisions can almost become a tick-box exercise. While this might be a bureaucrat's dream, this alone is not enough justification for lowering the bar as low as this bill does. The bill is retrospective, so will immediately have implications for all visa holders if passed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also some serious unintended consequences that might arise from this bill, not least of which is that we would potentially be separating families and disrupting lives by cancelling or refusing the visas of people who pose no real or ongoing threat to the community. The bill's explanatory memorandum says the reason the offence must be punishable by at least two years in jail is to make it clear that a designated offence must be a serious offence and not merely a minor or trifling one. But the fact is that no custodial sentence is required, and a lack of safeguards in the legislation, even for children, undermines this attempt at reassurance. Not only that, the bill will lead to a substantial jump in visa cancellations, which will lead to greater pressure on the already slow and overstretched tribunal and court systems, and place more people in onshore detention while they wait for outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A submission from a field of experts, including a former immigration department deputy secretary, estimated that the bill could lead to a five-fold increase in cancellations. The number of visas cancelled on character grounds has already increased 11-fold since 2014, when the Migration Act was reformed to strengthen the character test. Around a quarter of the people in detention are here due to visa cancellations under section 50, and those that challenge these decisions often face prolonged detention at significant cost. As the Law Council said in its submission, a decision to cancel or refuse a visa will almost always have a profound and direct impact on people's lives. For many people, it would mean permanent separation from family. This power should not be expanded without robust justification. What is missing in all of this is a demonstrated need for these laws. No compelling case has been made that the existing laws are insufficient to protect the community from real risk. That is why I will most certainly be opposing this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  [by video link] Australia is an open nation. We are a welcoming people, and we stand towards the world with open arms. We have a proud multicultural history and there is no doubt that the vast majority of immigrants to Australia have greatly enriched the story of this nation. These immigrants uphold Australian values, support our way of life, contribute to our democracy and feel proud to be Australian. These are people of good character, who think Australia is a country worth protecting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is simply common sense that we must be alert to the inherent dangers that accompany our otherwise generous immigration policies. It is an unfortunate truth that not all who wish to come to this country do so with honesty or integrity. Serious and hardened criminals often attempt to enter the country on false pretences, seeking to do us harm, threatening the safety of our children, undermining our social order and corroding our way of life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the duty of every government to provide for the safety and protection of its people. This government will not shirk that duty. This bill stands as a testament to the government's commitment to see Australians safe and secure from any threat which lurks beyond our borders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I move to the substance of the bill, I want to challenge the Greens' extreme opposition to the bill and some of the unfortunate remarks made by Senator McKim, which I won't repeat. I will say this in relation to his advocacy for a bill of rights. Over the past 18 months we've seen many what I regard as fundamental breaches of human rights here in Victoria under the guise of health restrictions—people being locked in their homes with no warning and no medication, as happened with the public housing towers in Flemington last year. Victorians have been locked out of their homes for weeks on end under the guise, again, of border protection, under circumstances where people were effectively forced into homelessness and where some people were denied the right to seek medical treatment from their own doctor. Of course, there's the overnight curfew. It has been impressed upon the state government for such a long time that this is wholly unnecessary. There is a charter of human rights and responsibilities in Victoria, and this made absolutely no difference to constraining the exercise of power and these draconian restrictions under the guise of health orders. It is disappointing, I note for the record, that the Greens have not raised their voices in relation to some of these serious transgressions of human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now move to this bill, which amends section 501 of the Migration Act to provide that a person will objectively not pass the character test if the person has been convicted of a designated offence which carries a maximum sentence of not less than two years. The minister and his delegates within the department will then have the discretion to cancel or refuse a visa on that basis. A designated offence—I reiterate this, particularly given the remarks of Senator Griff—is not a minor offence. It is an offence which involves violence against a person, non-consensual conduct of a sexual nature, breaching an order made by a court or tribunal for the personal protection of another person or using or possessing a weapon. Any offence which commands a jail sentence of a minimum of two years is a serious offence in this country. So this is no free-for-all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In making a decision to cancel or refuse a visa on this ground, the department will need to take into account a wide range of factors contained within a binding ministerial discretion. Those factors include: the protection of the Australian community from criminal or other serious conduct; the best interests of minors in Australia; expectations of the Australian community; Australia's international obligations; the impact on victims; and the nature and extent of the person's ties to Australia. The bill provides a clear standard for anyone seeking to enter this country as to what kind of person we expect them to be. The bill also enables the minister or his delegates to prevent criminals, including people convicted of violent assault related offences, from coming to this country who might otherwise slip through our current legal regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By strengthening the character test in the Migration Act, this bill strengthens Australia's security and protects the Australian people. Moreover, it does this in a sophisticated way. For example, the proposed subsection 501(7AA)(b) provides that a person's conviction for an offence of common assault or an equivalent offence is taken not to be a conviction for a designated offence unless the act constituting the offence for which the person was convicted causes or substantially contributes to bodily harm to another person or harm to another person's mental health within the meaning of the Criminal Code—in both cases temporarily or permanently—or involves family violence as defined by the Family Law Act by the person in relation to another person. Let me reiterate: this means that low-level assaults, including threats, that neither cause nor contribute to a person's bodily harm or harm their mental health and do not involve family violence will not cause a person to fail the character test. However, if a low-level assault does involve family violence then this will constitute a designated offence. As I say and reiterate, this is not about minor offences. This relates to more serious offences to ensure that the Australian community does not come under any threat from any person who has slipped through the net. So not only does this bill reflect the government's attention to concerns that the designated offences grounded in the original bill may unintentionally capture low-level offending—and certainly we have addressed that—it also demonstrates the government's commitment to combatting family violence wherever it occurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard that there are some, including senators opposite and some members of the crossbench and the Greens, who think this bill is wholly unnecessary, that it unduly gives the minister too much power to restrict immigration. There are some who even argue that the bill is problematic because it might harm our relations with other countries. To those people I say: where is your concern for the Australian people? This is, first and foremost, about protecting our community. The bill gives the minister the power to stop convicted criminals from entering this great country. That is not overreach, that is not unnecessary—far from it. It is wholly right and good that the government does everything in its power to safeguard our freedoms and our way of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's record on this issue is impressive and it far outstrips Labor's paltry efforts. The Rudd-Gillard government refused only 1,128 visas on character grounds. In contrast, after significant reforms in 2013-14, as we heard in the excellent contribution from Senator Van, this government has already cancelled or refused visas to over 9,900 serious criminals. That's almost 10 times as many serious criminals kept out of the Australian community than under Labor. Of the 9,900 cancellations and refusals, 216 were for murder; 1,372 were for sexual offences, including 905 for child sex and child pornography offences, rape and serious sexual offences against adults; 498 were for armed robbery, 1,701 were for drug offences; 37 were for kidnapping; and nearly 4,000 were for other violent offences, including assault, grievous bodily harm, reckless injury, domestic violence, stalking, intimidation, use of a weapon and attempted murder. Furthermore, the government has cancelled or refused visas to over 320 organised crime figures, including members of outlaw motorcycle gangs. These figures demonstrate the government's commitment to keeping our community safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also would not result in the automatic cancellation—and this is an important point—or refusal of any visas at all. Rather, this bill gives the minister and his delegates the power to review the visa status of any non-citizen convicted of a serious criminal offence. The bill also makes sure that visa applications are reviewed carefully and in accordance with clear criteria. This is prudent. As far as our relations with other countries are concerned, the government's first and overriding duty is to the people of Australia, not the governments of other countries or their representatives. The government was elected by the people of Australia and we intend to govern in their interests—cognisant, of course, of the important role that our government plays and our country plays in the global community and the responsibilities we have to other nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is proud of its efforts and success in protecting the people of this great nation. We know that the Australian people value commonsense legislation when it comes to protecting their communities—and this bill is exactly that. Common sense dictates that if nefarious people wish to enter this country we must stop them. It's as simple as that. Even the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Albanese, agrees that serious criminals who are visa holders should be deported from this country. This bill also affirms that other maxim of common sense: entry into Australia is a privilege, not a right. It is a privilege to enter this country, partake of its freedoms, enjoy its democratic culture and flourish in its egalitarian spirit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a critical bill, and the current proposed amendments are crucial to ensuring the government meets the expectations of the Australian people that noncitizens wishing to enter this country who have been convicted of serious crimes will be appropriately dealt with. It is of paramount importance that we pass this bill so that the government can do its great work in protecting Australians from threats to their livelihoods, to their families and to their wellbeing, and to first and foremost keep Australian communities safe. I commend this bill to the Senate. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to speak to the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2019. I associate myself with the remarks of my colleague Senator McKim, who has laid out in no uncertain terms how damaging and toxic this bill really is. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to specify that a person does not pass the character test under section 501 and may have their visa cancelled or visa application refused if they have been convicted of a designated offence. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Organisation after organisation have stood up and opposed this bill: the Refugee Council, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, the Law Council and many more. FECCA has pointed out the dire consequences for those who are deemed to fail the character test on arbitrary grounds—in particular, refugees and long-term permanent residents. FECCA states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">An individual may be removed to a country where they do not speak the language; where they have spent little time (or never lived); and where they have no familial, social or economic connections. Further, those who are unable to be returned to their country of citizenship, for example refugees and stateless people, risk indefinite prolonged periods of arbitrary detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has been sitting around for two years. It passed the House of Representatives in September 2019. Before that, an identical bill had been introduced into the House in October 2019. You really have to wonder: why is the government finally bringing this on now? Even if you accept their argument that this bill is critical to protecting Australians' safety, how does this square up with letting it languish for three years? The only explanation I can think of is that bringing this bill on now, months out from an election, is pure politics. The government sees political advantage in having this debate now. We know that they rely on drumming up fear and anxiety about migrants and criminality on the eve of an election It's the oldest play in the book. They want to portray themselves as the ones who will be the toughest on borders, the toughest on migrants, the toughest on crime, and they are cynically and shamefully trying to spin all of this as a big problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, you are playing with the lives of migrants as you use us as pawns in your political games, because that's all you care about: your political advantage. And you're sacrificing people already at risk—the same people you have dog-whistled against and dehumanised and demonised. But what more can we expect of this government?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During COVID, pandemic responses targeted and stigmatised communities in western and south-western Sydney with police operations, military presence and curfews, like no other community in New South Wales. The only people who were left out of pandemic support were migrant workers, temporary visa holders and international students. They were left high and dry in precarious employment and dangerous work situations because you did not lift a finger to help them. Why? Because they can't vote. Why? Because they don't look like you; they look like me. Why? Because you don't give a damn. But you are all fine with using international students as cash cows, harvesting their money when it suits you. You are fine with migrant workers doing the hard work that others won't do: driving taxis; being late-night workers at 7-Eleven; serving your food at restaurants; cleaning your buildings; working as security guards, providing protection at all hours. You take, take, take and you give nothing back in return. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is, whether we have the blue passport or not, our citizenship, our belonging to this country is conditional. Our Australianness is conditional. It is conditional on us keeping our heads down and our mouths shut. It is conditional on us being grateful for being let in. It is conditional on agreeing with those in power. It is conditional on giving up our identity and assimilating. And even then you're not happy, and you want to grind us down even more by bringing bills like this to parliament. We have—and we should have—the same rights and privileges as anyone who lives in this multicultural country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's another truth: multiculturalism in this country is just skin deep. It is measured only in the economic value migrants bring here through their business, their expertise, their skills, their food and their culture. Politicians use us as photo opportunities at our cultural festivals. They use us as voting blocs when they need us in elections. They come to Diwali, to Eid and to Baisakhi; they stand with us and make promises that they never fulfil. They never address the issues we face: exploitation at work, racism, unemployment. When those issues come up for us every single day, you are nowhere to be seen. You'll take our money, you'll take our hard work, you'll take our vote, but you won't listen to us. You won't give us a seat at the decision-making table either. You keep telling us to wait our turn, to get to the back of the queue. I'm afraid that I do have to look at Labor as well, because that's exactly what you are doing in Fowler, one of most multicultural seats in Australia. You do a lot of talking, but little walking. We are not here to be used, abused and marginalised. We deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Shame on you Liberals for bringing this toxic, destructive, damaging bill into the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  This is a very important amendment to a bill. I see it as a continuation of the support for border control and stopping the boats, which has been a totally successful aspect of how this country runs itself. I see it as a very important part of Operation Sovereign Borders, of which I was co-author and one of the people who made that policy work. This is probably the single most successful policy with regard to this country defining itself as a sovereign nation, and sovereign nations control their own borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greens and Labor got that appallingly wrong over a very long period of time. We have just heard Senator Faruqi say that these are political games we're playing, and all that we care about is exploiting newcomers to this country. What an appalling statement. What an absolutely appalling statement. I took part in Operation Sovereign Borders for the simple reason that Labor and the Greens had caused the deaths of 1,200 people through their incompetence in applying border controls. Time and time again, we have saved many multiples of that 1,200 that were lost at sea—women and children—who our sailors saw on a daily basis rotting in the sea and taken by sharks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an essential manifestation of being a sovereign country, and there are various reasons that we can look at as to why we should proceed with this bill, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2019, and with this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is that it is a national security issue. The people of Australia must have faith that the borders will be controlled. Border control is not an easy policy; it is a difficult policy, and there are aspects of it which are very, very unpleasant. For the Australian people to have faith in how our borders are managed, it is critically important that we continue to maintain them. Criminals or non-Australians who do not subscribe to the Australian way of life, which is to obey the law, have no right to remain in this country. So that's the first point.</span>

                    </a>  The second reason is to keep Australians safe. We've heard an awful lot about that. We've gone through the number of murders, the number of rapes and the amount of family violence. The second reason is to keep Australians safe, and that is the ultimate obligation of any government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third reason is to support victims, such as rape victims and the family members of those who have been murdered. Any number of commendations for this bill have been given by people who made the simple statement that, if this bill had existed, their family member would not have been killed, raped or beaten.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth reason—I will limit my presentation to that at this stage—is respect for citizenship. We have an extraordinarily welcoming country. We give citizenship, after a period of time, to anyone who comes here legally and we are very, very generous in it. But it's not a right. It is a privilege for people who are prepared to obey Australian laws. That is what the character test is all about: whether you are, in fact, willing to obey Australian laws. This is, I believe, illustrated most specifically by the figures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A simple figure to begin with is that the Rudd-Gillard government only cancelled and refused a total of 1,128 visas on character grounds. We are very proud of the fact that, by contrast, after significant reforms in 2014, this government has already cancelled or refused visas to over 9,900 serious criminals. If people don't think that this was for serious crimes, then they really haven't looked at the detail of what is going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just run through it once again for the benefit of Labor and the Greens. Of the 9,900 cancellations and refusals, 216 were for murder and 1,372 were for sexual offences, including 905 for child sex and child pornography offences. So whose interests are we looking after by claiming the right of these non-Australian, noncitizen criminals to stay in this country? Are we looking after the families of those who were murdered? Are we looking after the 905 who had committed child sex and child pornography offences, or the 467 who had committed rape and/or serious sexual offences against adults? This is absolutely appalling. This is an incorrect focus, not where the mind of this country should be. It is faux civil rights and faux humanity to say that these people have any right to stay in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Four hundred and ninety-eight of the 9,900 had committed armed robbery. We are deeply concerned at the moment that, during the COVID-19 period, people have lost their income. We see time and time again not just the traumatic impact on individuals but the economic impact on individuals who have been subjected to armed robbery—nearly 500 cases amongst the 9,900 people who have had their visas refused or cancelled. There were 1,701 for drug offences There were 37 for kidnapping. There were 3,908 for other violent offences, including assault, grievous bodily harm, reckless injury, domestic violence, stalking, intimidation, use of a weapon and attempted murder. If they were Australian citizens, they would be treated differently, but they have elected not to be Australian citizens, regardless of how long they may have stayed in this country. They've elected not to become Australian citizens, and that's a decision that they have made, for the consequences of which they have to suffer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I say that this is an amendment bill that is worth supporting. It should be supported, if for no other reason than for the victims of those who have been deported—for the victims of those who have had their visas and the great privilege of Australian citizenship removed from them.</span>

I thank all members for their contributions to the debate on this bill. The bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to provide grounds for noncitizens who commit serious offences and who pose a risk to the good order and safety of the Australian community to be appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that certain offences have a significant impact on victims and their communities. Like the Australian community, the government has a low tolerance for criminal behaviour and believes that entry or stay in Australia should remain a privilege granted only to those of good character. We remain committed to upholding the good order and safety of our community and protecting our residents. The amendments in the bill allow for discretionary visa refusal or cancellation where a noncitizen has a conviction for a designated offence punishable by at least two years imprisonment. Designated offences include violent and sexual crimes, breaching personal protection orders like AVOs, using or possessing a weapon or assisting with any of these crimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments address gaps in the character test to capture noncitizens who have been convicted of a serious crime punishable by at least two years imprisonment, have received less than 12 months imprisonment for their crimes and pose a risk to the Australian community. The bill is specifically designed to protect women and children from family violence. That's why it targets violent and sexual crimes as well as breaches of personal protection orders like apprehended violence orders. Furthermore, the existing ministerial directions set family violence as a primary consideration for decision-makers when they apply the character test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Morrison government, foreign criminals have been deported at record rates. We will continue to keep Australians safe by seeking to ensure our laws allow us to deport even more serious criminals. Anthony Albanese and Labor should either back these changes or provide a much clearer explanation as to why they will not. The bill deserves the support of all members and I commend the bill to the Senate chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  In rising to speak to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Improving Supports for At Risk Participants) Bill 2021, I want to start by particularly acknowledging the important and valuable work that my colleague Senator Steele-John has done as disability rights and services spokesperson both on this bill and in this portfolio more generally. I want to start by just setting the framework of what the Australian Greens' position on people with disabilities is. The Australian Greens believe that disabled people have a universal and immutable right to agency, safety, bodily autonomy, privacy, education, employment, housing, social support and health care. They have a right to participate in decision-making and policy creation in their communities. As Greens, we want to see the removal of all environmental, social, cultural, attitudinal and communication barriers to the full and equal participation of disabled people in all aspects of life and community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to commenting on specific provisions in this bill, I want to show how the government's failures in relation to this bill are linked to a broader pattern of the rights of disabled people, sadly, not being upheld. Clearly, this bill came about because of the horrific circumstances of the manslaughter of Ann-Marie Smith, which really shocked the nation. Certainly, on the basis of the speeches we've heard here in the parliament today, every one of us was filled with horror at the torture, essentially, that Ann-Marie was put through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We then had the Robertson review, which led to the bill currently before us. This, of course, occurred within the context of the broader review of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. The Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS has heard evidence of further reforms that need to be made to ensure that the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission works for disabled people nationally. I want to particularly highlight some of the process concerns that have been raised by stakeholders as part of this review, including through the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Inquiry into the disability support pension. The submission from the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of this bill particularly noted the lack of consultation. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In responding to the death of Ms Anne-Marie Smith in South Australia, AFDO was contacted by the Robertson Review to provide perspective on how to improve support for vulnerable participants. That was the sole point of consultation in this process that led to Minister Reynolds seeking changes to the NDIS Act to improve supports for at risk participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In receiving the Review Report in September 2020, it is AFDO's view that the Quality and Safeguards Commission had a responsibility to once again involve people with disability and Disability Representative Organisations in consultations regarding what changes to the NDIS Act might be needed. This did not occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is AFDO's view that the lack of consultation about the recommendations of the Robertson Review and proposed changes to the NDIS Act has led in this particular circumstance to a missed opportunity. The 'missed opportunity' here for AFDO was discussion about improving supports for at risk participants such as those detained under order in state and territory forensic facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our additional comments that we made as part of the inquiry report, the Australian Greens noted: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation has been brought before the parliament, without appropriate consultation with the disability community, at a time where co-design and community involvement are key issues. This is not ok, this is not acceptable, and the government must work to remedy this immediately. "Nothing about us, without us" is consistent across the entire spectrum of disability policy and it is no different in this instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The disability community was not consulted with in the drafting of this legislation. They found out about this legislation on the 3rd of June 2021 when it was tabled in parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens are strongly of the view that the government and its departments and agencies must at the very least properly consult with the disability community and their publicly funded disability representative bodies, and publish exposure drafts before introducing legislation to ensure that policies, systems, and services are designed by and for disabled people. This ultimately ensures that our systems are effective and fit-for-purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would change the way that participant information can be used and shared. I want to quote here from the submission from People with Disability Australia and present their perspective on the changes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, there is an extremely high threshold the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) must meet before protected and private information is disclosed about people with disability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS Act provides that disclosure is allowed only when it is "necessary to prevent or lessen a serious threat to an individual's life, health or safety". We find it highly concerning that the Bill ratifies quite expansive data-sharing on the alleged basis of keeping people with disability safe—from future unknown possible events or given past potentially irrelevant events—which then enables unspecified actions to be undertaken, without a person knowing and or the ability to appeal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This potentially secretive breach of our privacy could mean the NDIA or its data manager(s) has access to our private health information, psychiatry records, or other private records, potentially for the purposes of defending legal actions, such as Administrative Appeals Tribunal hearings, Centrelink prosecutions and other legal action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This breach of our privacy is a direct breach of the international human rights law Australia is a signatory to, including article 22 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The right to privacy is incredibly important, and this is something the Greens pointed out in additional comments in the community affairs committee report: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens are concerned that the privacy rights of participants are being put at risk, and that there could be significant consequences for the safety of participants should their information be mishandled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Peak advocacy bodies that gave evidence to the inquiry also expressed deep concern about the two-way information-sharing provisions being proposed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight another distinct concern, about reviewable decisions. As our additional comments noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Item 42 of the bill inserts a new subsection that prevents a decision-maker reviewing a decision that they were personally involved in. However, it allows for a decision-maker to review a reviewable decision made by a delegate of the decision-maker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The practical effect of this change has not been clearly explained by the NDIA, they must provide transparency in relation to their processes to ensure that any conflicts of interest, particularly where managers are reviewing decisions made by their staff are concerned, are addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the concerns with this bill, I also want to take the opportunity to reflect on the evidence we've heard through a separate community affairs references inquiry about the disability support pension. This is relevant to this NDIS bill because it goes to the heart of the government's failure to remove all barriers to the full and equal participation of disabled people in all aspects of life and community. Everybody agrees that disabled people should be valued, respected, treated with dignity and able to live fulfilling and meaningful lives. I would say that, to a person, everybody in this place would say: 'Of course that's right. Of course disabled people should be able to live their lives to the full.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everybody that we have heard speak on this bill today was horrified about the horrific treatment of Ann-Marie Smith. But, sadly, Ann-Marie Smith was not an isolated case. Her tragic death was an extreme case, but she's not the only person with disabilities being badly treated by this government. Much of this mistreatment is not being addressed by this bill or even by the broader review of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. The basics of ensuring that disabled people aren't living in poverty is under attack by this government. The disability support pension leaves people with hardly enough to get by, particularly when the extra costs of having a disability are factored in. Eligibility has been massively tightened up in recent years, with more and more people found to not be eligible despite living with really significant disabilities. More and more people with disabilities who are deemed to have a partial capacity to work are left languishing, living hand to mouth on JobSeeker, not able to afford the basics of food, rent and clothes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the inquiry into the disability support pension which is currently underway by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, we have heard so many stories of people who are really struggling. One that sticks in my mind is the story of Doug from East Gippsland in Victoria. Doug was almost killed in the catastrophic 2019 fires, but he's had his DSP application rejected. He's living with chronic physical injuries and PTSD. Doug has had 37 referrals to psychologists and other health professionals, but he actually couldn't even get an appointment with one of them for over a year because he lives in a remote part of Australia and those professionals just aren't there. Because he couldn't get that assessment, he couldn't complete the application. Then, even when he got to completing the application, his application was rejected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their submission to the DSP inquiry, the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Disability Support Pension (DSP) application and review processes serve as a vehicle for systemic harm, wherein the power of the Australian Government is leveraged against some of the most vulnerable people with disability.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rules and processes have evolved to gradually erode the safety net for people with disability. Either the Government's policies are working as intended to prevent people with disability from getting the support they need, or their negligence has left a system in place that harms us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is powerful, damning evidence. Through the inquiry process to date we've heard stories from people who have been forced to pay for their medications using AfterPay or who have been pressured to undergo medical sterilisation so they can be considered fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised. We've heard awful accounts of people being forced to choose between treatment and feeding their families and of not being able to get treatment for cancer because they can't afford the transport to appointments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The choices this government is making have left people trapped in poverty. People with disabilities have been trapped on an income support payment that's below the poverty line. That's unacceptable. It shows that the concerns that we raised about this bill aren't isolated, that there is a pattern here and that the rights of people with disabilities are not being fully considered and given the import that they deserve by this government. This reflects a systematic failure by the Liberals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As foreshadowed in our additional comments in the committee report and reflecting the amendments that have been circulated, we believe that this bill should only pass through the parliament if it is amended to reflect the significant feedback provided by the community during the course of this inquiry. But, sadly, once again, the Morrison government has failed to consult disabled people in the drafting and design of legislation. This repeated indifference and deliberate exclusion of disabled voices from policy processes is, frankly, ridiculous and it continues to endanger the safety and the lives of the people who are affected by these changes in legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate and </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  The point that Senator Rice made just before she resumed her seat is an absolutely critical point for this chamber to consider, and that is that the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2019 has been brought before the parliament without appropriate consultation with the disability community. This is particularly egregious, given that co-design of legislation such as this and genuine community involvement in the drafting of legislation like this is absolutely imperative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time after time, we see this parliament pass legislation that has a significant impact on the lives of a group of people in this country without having adequately engaged with them on the drafting of the relevant legislation. That is not okay. That is not acceptable. The onus here is on everyone in this chamber, but in particular the government, to ensure that, when the government presents legislation to this chamber, it has done the often time-consuming work of genuinely engaging with the people who are going to be impacted by that legislation. The government's got a lot of lessons to learn in this area and it's got to work to improve the way that it engages and consults, as a matter of urgency. Something that's consistent across the spectrum of disability policy is the adage 'nothing about us without us', and that absolutely encapsulates what should be the way the government approaches legislation such as this, but all too often we find the government does something to people without adequately engaging with and consulting them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want to acknowledge and thank those organisations and people who submitted evidence to the committee inquiry and gave their time, their effort, their experience and their expertise. As I was just saying, community led policy is fundamental to ensuring that we collectively uphold the rights of disabled people and that we empower disabled people to lead the decision-making process and to occupy the places where decisions are made. 'Nothing about us without us.' I want to acknowledge my friend and colleague Senator Steele-John for the way that he has conducted himself as the holder of the relevant Australian Greens portfolio and as a disabled person who genuinely leads his community by genuine engagement with that community. It is absolutely inspirational to see the way that he has done that, and there are lessons that all of us could learn from Senator Steele-John on the way we represent people in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of key recommendations that have emerged through the inquiry into this legislation that we have to build on to ensure that the rights of disabled people—as stated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities—are upheld. And I want to say here that this government has made an absolute art form of ignoring its international obligations. They are quite happy to sideline their international obligations when it suits them politically. And we see that time after time, and in issues that I speak on often in this place, such as the rights of people who are refugees or who seek asylum in Australia under the provisions of the refugee convention. And this country, shamefully on a bipartisan basis, turns a blind eye to the obligations that we have signed up to under the refugee convention, and abuses most terribly the human rights of those people. We need to stop turning a blind eye to our international obligations. We have given our word as a country on the international stage that we will abide by these international obligations, and we have a lot of work to do to make sure that the rights of disabled people that are enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are upheld.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key issue which frames the conversation around this legislation is around the dichotomy of rights safety. Now, this dichotomy often forgets the fact that the enforcement of people's rights and strong accountability are critical elements of ensuring people's safety—and that, colleagues, is what we need to focus on; those critical elements that ensure the safety of disabled people. It is absolutely critical when looking at the broader safeguarding framework in Australia. And safeguarding is a critical area in need of reform. The Robertson review produced a number of key recommendations for improving the National Disability Insurance Scheme Quality and Safeguards Commission, and there remains an ongoing discussion about how best to implement those recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation proposes changes that carry serious implications for the human rights of participants, and, critically, for the privacy rights of participants and some unanswered questions around the practical effect of the two-way information sharing arrangements. The National Disability Insurance Scheme Quality and Safeguards Commission and the National Disability Insurance Agency need to understand that it is incumbent on them to improve the way that they explain—in plain, easily understandable language—what this legislation seeks to do and how it will affect participants. Again, this goes back to the principle of genuine engagement with the people who are impacted and affected by any piece of legislation, because that engagement shouldn't only happen as the legislation is developed and drafted and ultimately debated in this parliament. It needs to keep happening if the legislation passes to make sure that the people who are affected by that legislation understand what the impacts on them will be and understand what their rights are, whether they be human rights or privacy rights or any other rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes that are proposed in this legislation emerged from the horrific manslaughter of Ann-Marie Smith. The Robertson review, from which this legislation has sprung, was commissioned in response to those tragic circumstances. The Greens want to note that there is currently a broader review of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission being undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS. We understand that committee has heard evidence of further reforms that need to be made to ensure that the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission works properly for disabled people nationally. With regard to a lack of consultation, we want to place very firmly on the record that the disability community were not adequately consulted as this legislation was being drafted; in fact, shamefully, they found out about this legislation on 3 June this year, when it was tabled in parliament. That is a completely unacceptable way to treat people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations stated in their evidence to the committee inquiry that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The exclusion of people with disability and their representative organisations in putting forward the amendment bill and the failure of the minister to adequately include the substantive amendments being called for by the community in response to participants who were vulnerable and at risk of abuse and neglect is absolutely inappropriate and has caused this amendment bill to fail in its objectives. It is our submission that the minister has a duty to consult with people with disability and their representative organisations when making and amending laws which directly impact them. The minister has failed to do so and, as a consequence, there is a serious and significant threat to the human rights of people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, that lays it out pretty starkly for colleagues here. It reiterates the arrogance of a government that thinks it can come in here and legislate in a way that has impacts on the lived experiences and lives of disabled people without adequately consulting with them and their representative organisations. That is such a shame. In fact, it's just the attitude that has led us to where we are now—a royal commission. Again, I congratulate Senator Steele-John for his leadership in ensuring that that royal commission was established and his leadership in ensuring that, to the greatest degree possible, it is being run in a way that respects the rights and the needs of disabled people. Looking after the rights and the needs of disabled people is exactly why that royal commission was established in the first place. We haven't been doing that for so long in this country, and we are yet to get this country to a place where we can all say that we fundamentally respect and deliver on the rights of disabled people in Australia. I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) notes that whilst the disability community was variably consulted during the course of the Robertson Review, it was not consulted on this bill and the implementation of the recommendations that emerged from the final report of the Robertson Review; and</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) is strongly of the view that the Government and its departments and agencies must properly consult the disability community and their publicly funded disability representative bodies, and publish exposure drafts before introducing legislation, to ensure that policies, systems, and services are designed by and for disabled people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge all colleagues to support this amendment. It goes to the very heart of the way the government has failed to consult on this legislation. It expresses extremely clearly, and allows the Senate to adopt, a view that the government and all of its departments and agencies must in the future properly consult with disabled people and their representative bodies; and that that consultation should be genuine in that it needs to ensure that exposure drafts of legislation are published before legislation is introduced and puts disabled people at the very heart of designing policies, systems and services that impact on their lives and their lived experiences as disabled people.</span>

I also thank them all for their acknowledgement of the significance of this bill. I think the debate that we've had on this bill is a really important reminder to us all of the great good that we can do for some of our most vulnerable when we come together in a common cause in this chamber. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commence my remarks by recognising the tragic circumstances in which South Australian NDIS participant Ms Ann-Marie Smith died. I also recognise all the circumstances in which an NDIS participant has been subject to abuse, neglect or exploitation. As all colleagues in this place who have spoken have acknowledged, Ms Smith's death continues to be a source of deep distress for all Australians. It is my most sincere hope that this bill provides comfort and assurance to participants, to families, to their friends, to their carers, that this government, with the support of all in this chamber, is taking action to better protect them, to reduce the likelihood or the risk that such a horrific event could happen again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes changes to the NDIS Act 2013 in response to issues identified in various inquiries into recent cases of abuse and neglect of people with disability, including the independent review conducted by former Federal Court judge the Hon. Alan Robertson SC into the tragic death of Ms Ann-Marie Smith. The review was done at the request of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner, and the report was a report to the commission and not directly to government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, this bill strengthens information-sharing arrangements. It allows conditions to be attached to the approval of quality auditors. It enables the NDIS Commissioner to further specify reportable incidents and it makes a range of other technical changes designed to improve the operation of the NDIS Commission. In summary, these amendments will help ensure the wellbeing of NDIS participants, including those who are at greater risk of harm, and ensure that the commissioner has clear and effective powers to regulate NDIS providers and respond to incidence of violence, abuse, neglect, and shameful exploitation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot possibly overstate this government's commitment to improving protections and safeguards for NDIS participants, especially those most vulnerable and at risk of harm and exploitation. This includes recognising the importance of continuing to review the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework to ensure a quality and safe market for NDIS participants through providing nearly $1 million for a framework review in last year's budget. This key review will consider the framework's effectiveness in the context of NDIS policy development and the evolving nature of the NDIS market, to identify any further opportunities to strengthen protections for all participants, with a report due by the end of next year. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does not support the second reading amendment by the Greens. I'd like to explain to all in this chamber the reasons for that. We've heard from the Greens that there hasn't been sufficient consultation, and I would like to refute that most strongly and sincerely. Let me explain why. The amendments in the bill relate to recommendations, as I've said, from the Robertson review, a review requested by the Quality and Safeguards Commissioner and delivered to the commission. Importantly, in informing his views, the Hon. Alan Robertson invited public consultation in the context of his investigation. The recommendations that he delivered were very well received by the sector, including by people with disability, and all major political parties have called on the Australian government to implement these recommendations. That is exactly what we are doing here today. During his consultations, 46 submissions were received either verbally or in writing. In addition to the submissions received, Mr Robertson also wrote, as a courtesy, to 38 individuals who may have an interest, to inform them of his review and the terms of reference. This bill here today responds to this consultation and the recommendations. It is an important next step—and I highlight that that is just a next step but a very important one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Discussions were also held between the Department of Social Services and the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations on 16 June this year to discuss these very amendments and to get their input into the proposed bill, but the discussions also provided the opportunity for a policy explanation of the intent of the government in these recommendations. Additionally, a further consultation will occur where amendments to NDIS rules are required to implement these legislative amendments during the scheduled review of the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework later this year. So there remain many other opportunities on an ongoing basis for the sector, participants and all of those who are interested in improving how we care for and safeguard NDIS participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this consultation, the bill was scrutinised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, where sector representatives were able to provide comment and speak to their concerns at the public hearing. I thank each and every one of you who provided input, because it was very important input into the development and finalisation of the bill that we are dealing with today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to note that while the government is not supporting Senator Hanson's second reading amendments it is not because we don't agree with the sentiments in that amendment. The government is very grateful for Senator Hanson's engagement in the NDIS to ensure its future sustainability and viability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I thank the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for their consideration of this bill. Most importantly, I thank each and every one of you in this chamber and in this place more generally who have contributed to this bill today, because if there is anything that unites all of us in the chamber it is this bill today to make life safer for NDIS participants who are at risk. So I say to everybody here: For Ann-Marie Smith and every single NDIS participant who has been subject to abuse, neglect and exploitation: this bill is for you. I commend the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  Just briefly, I want to make a statement in relation to One Nation's second reading debate amendment. I didn't do a speech in the second reading debate. One Nation's amendment was seeking to constrain the amount of money that is being spent on the NDIS, and it was ambiguous in its nature. I just want to put on the record that the providers to the NDIS only ever charge the maximum rate. There's no competition. If you rock up and seek a service and you then mention you're on the NDIS, the full tote odds are paid. There needs to be some mechanism used to address that, because that means that people don't get the maximum service for the money that is available. It means the money's getting chewed up more quickly than it normally does. I ask the minister to consider how that problem might be addressed. It's the typical 'I'm here for a wedding, therefore the price that will be paid is very high'.</span>

In relation to the particular point that you raise, it is something that has been raised frequently with me as the minister. There is currently a pricing review underway by the NDIS to have a look at the whole pricing structure and rates for the NDIS. The government, in the last budget, is also having a look at how we better integrate the workforces themselves between disability, veterans and aged care. One of the things that I, Minister Hunt and Minister Gee are very conscious of is that we do pay the same providers very different rates for similar services. I think we absolutely need to improve that so that we move towards a single rate that not only doesn't actually inflate the cost of participants' services but also doesn't inadvertently push people, such as veterans, out of the market, which has been reported to be the case.</span>

Senator Hanson and I have been very strong in our comments because we see the need for protecting people with disabilities and supporting them, but we're afraid that the NDIS system, as it is, has been built on very poor foundations. It was a thought bubble by the Labor government to get votes—that's the way we assess it. It was never properly designed. Now it's too easily rorted and it's too bureaucratic in its control, so that the people who deserve support do not have it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  A net zero transition provides Australia with abundant opportunity, but because of the fallacy that net zero equals zero emissions, the common debate around emissions reduction has been tarnished by this government's political opponents, who either do not understand or wilfully ignore the fact that, in a net zero future, there will still be emissions generated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way that many developed states will reach the net zero target is by purchasing carbon offset credits and through the use of nuclear power. The use of abatement credits allows these states to quickly and cheaply slash their emissions without having to invest in the structural change that takes time to take effect and that actually cuts emissions. This approach can be described as little more than greenwashing on an international scale. They are already purchasing carbon offset credits from countries around the globe. This is in stark contrast to Australia's approach, where we have built structural changes into our energy systems and our other industries economy-wide that will actually bring down emissions and have been bringing down emissions on a scale that most other countries can only dream about. This provides Australia with a unique economic opportunity, because we are developing the technology to reach net zero and will have abundant potential to sell offset credits to those other nations. This practice is already underway in Australia through the Emissions Reduction Fund, which is going from strength to strength. This year the 1,000th project was registered and the millionth tonne of abatement was credited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear that Australia should be emitting as little as possible as it approaches its low-emissions targets. However, we should be working to become an economic powerhouse in selling carbon credits, and we are developing the technology that will fuel a low-emissions economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the transition to net zero, we should not be abandoning the exports that underpin our regions. We should be acknowledging the fact that net zero is not zero emissions. It's the difference between giving big parts of agriculture, heavy manufacturing and resources no future and giving them a bright future. For these sectors of our economy that support thousands of jobs and play a vital role in Australian society, we need to ensure that in a net zero economy they are able to thrive. The market is already adjusting to a future where coal is no longer the main source of energy generation, but that is not going to happen overnight. Until it is no longer needed, coalmining must continue to support our economy and continue to provide good jobs for thousands of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The transition to net zero provides Australia with bountiful economic opportunities. Our technology-not-taxes approach ensures that the Australian economy will continue to thrive in this transition as we drive down emissions. Investing in the development of low- and no-emissions technologies will not only help Australia reach net zero but also, importantly, help our friends and partners around the world reach net zero. By driving down the cost to produce low- or no-emissions energy sources, developing countries will no longer have to make the choice between emissions reduction and development. These two processes go hand in hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emissions reduction is a global challenge. Only by driving down the costs of clean alternatives—such as producing hydrogen at less than $2 a kilo or producing green aluminium at under $2,700 per tonne and green steel at under $900 per tonne—will these low-emission options be competitive with the traditional alternatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At these prices, low-emission alternatives would be available for everyone, not just Australia. Australia will become an exporter of these low-emission alternatives. These technologies will allow the globe's transition to a low-emissions economy. It is only through a global effort that this can be achieved. Developing these technologies, which our energy Technology Investment Roadmap clearly sets out, will allow Australia to remain a net exporter of energy; it will just be a different type of energy. This will ensure that the benefits of the coal export boom that we've seen recently will not be lost, and we will continue to reap the benefits of selling energy to states around the world. Similar to the LNG gas revolution which saw Australia become the second largest LNG exporter in the world, I see no reason why we cannot be a global low-emissions hydrogen or green steel exporter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy transition towards net zero presents Australia with vast opportunities that we should be grasping with two hands. It is clear from the Technology Investment Roadmap that work is well underway in Australia to support an economy that is not reliant on coal, both as a source of energy and income. The Technology Investment Roadmap sets out our priority low-emissions technologies and the economic stretch goals. Those priority low-emissions technologies that have been identified are: clean hydrogen; energy storage; low-carbon materials, such as steel and aluminium; carbon capture and storage; and soil carbon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our efforts to reach clean hydrogen under $2 per kilogram, the conservative estimates for our National Hydrogen Strategy indicate that a domestic industry could generate over 8,000 jobs and $11 billion a year in GDP. But this is not going to happen overnight. We have phases that we're going to go through while we achieve this. At the moment, blue hydrogen is a competitive energy source, but we are working hard to get green hydrogen under that price. That will likely take 10 years, but we should be doing that work now. The exporting of our coal is funding the investments that need to go into that. It's a $1.9 billion investment package into new energy technologies, which includes commitments that will support hydrogen, including $1.6 billion in new funding for ARENA; a $74.5 million future fuels package; and a $70.2 million fund to activate regional hydrogen export hubs. This will build on over $500 million committed towards hydrogen projects by the government at the launch of the National Hydrogen Strategy. Establishing hydrogen as a priority technology and working towards this stretch goal will reinforce these commitments and ensure Australia can capture a significant share of the growing global export demand for this technology. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I rise to speak on the rampant rorting of government money by the Morrison-Joyce governments. There was sports rorts, and I acknowledge the presence of my colleague, Senator Farrell here, who led the charge into the dark underworld of what goes on with this government. The only colourful part about it is the colour coded spreadsheets that align with marginal seats! It is a contemptuous set of programs that this government have advanced, and today I am particularly speaking about the commuter car park program. We need to ensure, as a house of review here in the Senate, that we oppose the spending of billions of taxpayer dollars as though it is Liberal campaign money to buy themselves yet another term in office. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak specifically about my home region of the Central Coast and how the Liberals' failed plans and broken promises have left the region that I live in worse off than it even was before the announcement. In my duty seat of Robertson, the local member for Robertson, Lucy Wicks, was gifted, supposedly, two commuter car parks. One was proposed to be in Woy Woy and another in Gosford. Yet, recent FOI documents reveal that this so-called commitment is yet another Liberal lie. In the case of the Woy Woy commuter car park, which was supposedly to draw a sum of $5 million, that announcement was made on 27 March 2019. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 23 July 2021, two whole years later, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Community News</span> on the Central Coast reported that Ms Wicks said that the concept design for the commuter carpark at Woy Woy was expected to be finalised this month, with Transport for NSW conducting a rapid viability assessment of the possible sites for the Gosford car park. That's how this member talks. She speaks about all the other agencies that are responsible for it, she finds other people to blame, and she puts other agencies and other levels of government in it. It's all just a cover-up of her failure to act and the falsehood of her so-called commitments to the people of the coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent of GIPA of Transport for NSW shows that the statement from Ms Wicks on 23 July couldn't be further from the truth. According to Transport for NSW there is no construction start or end milestone dates anywhere. There is no confirmed total cost. There is no New South Wales contribution for the Woy Woy commuter car park. That will come as news to people in Woy Woy who voted for Lucy Wicks in good faith, thinking that she was going to do the job that she should have done a long time ago. She has been in parliament for eight years, for three terms of government, and this commitment stinks because it's another con job from Lucy Wicks on the Central Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is especially significant considering the analysis of the proposed car park and the costings that were allocated would make it one of the most expensive car parks in the country for this 'pork and ride' scheme that the government tried to roll out. The average cost per space on the Central Coast would have been more than $200,000. I'll just say that again—$200,000 per car park. That's 430 per cent above the national benchmark. That's how badly this government has stuffed it up. I acknowledge in the chamber with me is Senator Raff Ciccone, and I know this rorting has gone on in an outrageous way in the great state of Victoria. Indeed, I believe the Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg, gifted himself four of these dodgy projects in his own electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the Gosford car park, that $30 million election announcement that sounded so good and encouraged people to vote for Lucy Wicks, the Liberals are even further behind with the delivery of that commitment. The only document that was revealed in the FOI request was a letter from the local Central Coast council saying they were 'unable to proceed with the project'. All announcement, no delivery. That is the signature of this government. It sums up what we are seeing day after day right across this country: a lot of talk, a lot of numbers splashed around and then an absolute failure to honour those commitments in any form or with any integrity, and a failure to deliver for the community the things they were promised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commuter Car Park Fund is in fact an astonishing example of poor governance and cynical politics, even for this Morrison government that plays Australia like it's a game. This failed fund has built a mere three car parks in three years, it has cancelled twice as many as that due to its inability to get the projects off the ground and there are another 47 unlikely to ever be built. Lucy Wicks failed Robertson when she did nothing for years, for the two terms that she had prior to the last election. She did no due diligence, no preparation, no work with the council, no work with the Commuters Association, no work with the state government to make sure that these car parks, about which she made numerical commitments, were actually viable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department advised against both the Gosford and Woy Woy car parks, stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The department is not in a position to recommend allocating … funding … or provide detailed advice on the relative merits, scope or funding profiles, given the limited time and information available …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that gives you an indication of how hastily and how rashly and how inappropriately Ms Wicks and this government and all the other Liberal Party members who lined up outside the Treasurer's office acted. They walked in with their hands out and said: 'Give me a few dollars to make an announcement. I don't care if I can't deliver it, just get me elected.' That was what was really going on. Lucy Wicks had been a member for six years at the time that this failure of planning and preparation was going on. If she was actually on the ball, if she was actually doing something for the people of the Central Coast, she would have had this sorted out months or years before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian National Audit Office was scathing about the car park report. It found that the car parks were heavily centred in Liberal electorates, particularly in Victoria, where the government was trying to save seats. This is despite the department showing that most of the congested roads in Australia are found, sadly, as Sydneysiders know, in the great state of New South Wales and in the capital city of our great state, Sydney. If you've sat on the freeways trying to get into and out of Sydney, you know exactly what I am talking about. An urban congestion fund was shown by the department to be needed for congested roads in Sydney and, instead of doing that, the 'Prime Minister for Sydney' abandoned us and started spreading pork around all over the place, particularly in Victoria, where he thought he needed to spend a few extra dollars to help his chances of re-election. It is a disgrace what is going on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some cases it was only the local MP who provided a justification for a multimillion dollar project by putting out a press release. That was all there was, with no due diligence behind it. The Australian National Audit Office found there was very little in the way of supporting evidence provided for the need for these car parks. I think Minister Frydenberg, the Treasurer of Australia, with all the resources of government, even promised a car park for a train station that was due to be closed. This could not be more farcical. Is there any wonder why the Liberals and the Nationals are terrified of a federal ICAC?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The kind of behaviour that I have been describing erodes public confidence in the rectitude and effectiveness of government. For all of Alan Tudge's and Scott Morrison's claims that it was just 'business as usual', the Australian people know better. Our taxpayer dollars need to work hard to advantage us ethically right across this country. Our dollars should not be used as a slush fund for the Liberal Party to line up its next election bid. That's what went on with all this rorting that they have made an art form of. Money should be going to where it's most needed, where the departments, the councils, the state governments and other ethical stakeholders are ready and able to go. This callous political arithmetic only benefits those in power, not those on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because Lucy Wicks didn't do her homework for three years, her botched and bungled commitment means that Central Coast residents are now further away than ever from the commuter car park they desperately need. But that was all that was needed for Mrs Wicks to get herself elected—an announcement. A degree of trust in the community got her the extra few votes she could count on and then she disappeared for the next three years and waited for the next pork rind to come along from her government. Coasties have to park further away. They have to wake up earlier and earlier to go searching for a park. I urge the people of Robertson to consider this disgrace as they cast their vote in the next federal election—no commuter car parks, no wi-fi on trains, no action on chronic GP shortages and no performing arts centre. Lucy Wicks has failed the coast. She is not worth anyone's vote.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senat</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">or COX</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  In the last six weeks, four women have died on the streets of Perth. In 2020, 56 homeless people died in Perth. Forty-four people have died on the streets since August last year. One-third of those people are First Nations. I note the families of the deceased are coming together now to ask for an inquiry. We echo the families' calls for a coronial inquest into these deaths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to sugar-coat this. There is a housing crisis in Western Australia. According to every indicator, the WA housing system is in absolute crisis, and First Nations people are experiencing firsthand the deadly toll of homelessness. The by-name list for Perth CBD, Fremantle and surrounding areas shows that 995 people are experiencing chronic homelessness, 17 per cent of whom are First Nations people. Refuges are currently turning away women and children, and staff across the entire sector are in complete distress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Betsy Buchanan is a strong advocate for Noongar people and has worked for years with First Nations families in Perth to help them advocate for housing and to generate political pressure for policy solutions to end homelessness. Dr Buchanan has described these deaths as 'Perth's own pandemic, claiming the lives of at least one of our people every week this winter'. She recently said: 'We are completely overwhelmed with families calling all day, from early in the morning. So many of these destitute families are calling for help burying their children, which costs thousands of dollars that we don't have. Others are demanding accommodation before they become the next death, desperately ill people discharged from ICUs and hospital straight back to the street. They are angry and embittered because there are so many deaths. People are terrified that they will be next. Their loved ones keep dying. This is a total crisis.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can we have a epidemic of deaths due to homelessness in a state with a $5 billion surplus? Housing in WA is systemically inadequate, to the point that the management represents chaotic breakdown at its best—chaotic management at the hands of the state. Last week, when I visited Carnarvon, I saw this firsthand. I went around and photographed 40 boarded-up homes. These houses were uninhabited and required full refurbishment. The population has declined from a peak of 8,000 people in 2016 to 4,000. It's now increased slightly, to 5,000 people in that town. But where's the government accountability?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The selection process to match people with housing is not being tailored to the needs of individuals and families. Research has found that First Nations applicants in WA wait longer on the priority public housing waitlist and are more likely to be evicted, especially under the state's punitive three-strikes eviction policy. If there's a breakdown between family and the department, it becomes a punitive response where people are evicted and families to longer have access to housing, and we all know that punitive approaches do not work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Successive governments have underinvested in social housing. Homelessness in some instances is an outcome of the chaotic breakdown of social housing management. However, on the whole there is a system of unmet, unaddressed need, and we need to come up with a better prevention model for the social issues and systemic racism which, along with present, past, collective and intergenerational trauma, are often among the major and primary contributing factors. The social determinants of health are critical in addressing the housing and homelessness crisis. Issues with education, income support and mental health all play a role in compounding the issues that First Nations people experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There needs to be a comprehensive and forensic audit and strategic review of social housing policy, management and maintenance to match individual, family and social needs, not just in Western Australia but nationally. We also need to incorporate the design and implementation of place based, culturally guided social and emotional healing and wellbeing activities for individuals to enhance self, family and community function and to enhance their general way of being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some serious concerns about the risk of overcrowding in our communities and the dangers that this poses, particularly in the outbreak of COVID. In Carnarvon in Western Australia, we are unable to actually quarantine, and we have all of those houses boarded up instead of being used as social housing. We have two places for ICU in the public hospital system. Where will these people go if we have an outbreak of COVID in a town like Carnarvon, which has 5,000 people?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have a strong plan to address the housing and homelessness crisis across this country. For decades, governments have rigged the private housing market with tax breaks that favour big developers and the rich property speculators. Our current housing system is worsening inequality. We have a plan to build one million homes, which would ensure that there are homes for all. These homes will be sustainable, accessible and affordable. Our new innovative shared equity ownership scheme will make it easier for people to own their first homes, where they want to live, for $300,000.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  It is a privilege, Senator Cox, to follow you in this chamber. It's the second time I've done that this week, in your first week. I think you made some extremely important points there, and one is left to ponder why it is that Western Australia has a budget surplus of $5 billion when its social housing provision is in such a terrible state, as you outlined. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was privileged to attend two celebrations over the last few weeks. When I gave my first speech in the Senate, I spoke about my passion for Australia's Pacific step-up program, and, as I've engaged more and more with the Pacific island diasporas in our beautiful country, I'm becoming even more passionate about the Pacific step-up program and its importance. So let me talk to you about the two celebrations I had the honour of attending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first was the Cook Islands celebration of self-government, the Te Maeva Nui 2021 celebration, which was put on by the Cook Islands Council of Queensland Inc. The Cook Islands flag, that beautiful flag with the Union Jack in the top left-hand corner and then the 15 stars representing the 15 islands of the Cook Islands, was proudly on display. The Cook Islands diaspora turned out in force. All the food you'd expect was there, and the arts and crafts—I did some early Christmas shopping—and cultural performances. It was all there to behold and it was just an outstanding event. I pay tribute to Mr Archie Atiau, who's president of the Cook Islands Council of Queensland Inc. Archie actually gave a dance, in the lead-up to his welcoming speech, which signified his enthusiasm for the celebration and how great it was for the community to come together. I also congratulate Councillor Mindy Russell from Logan City Council, who was in attendance. She gave a dance as well; she caught the enthusiasm. She is a great worker in the community in Logan City. So I pay tribute to Councillor Russell. I was the next speaker. I didn't dance physically. I was dancing on the inside; I was celebrating on the inside. I managed to restrain myself and didn't give any physical—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SCARR:</span>
                  </a>  Senator Walsh, I didn't hear that through your mask, but I'll assume you were complimenting me on my restraint! I did manage to restrain myself. But it was a great celebration. It also reflected, in my view, the great generosity of spirit of the Cook Islands people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw that the previous week when I attended BASE HQ, which has been set up by the Cook Islands Council of Queensland Inc, under the leadership of Archie Atiau. Every Wednesday they provide emergency food hampers to people in need in the community. It doesn't matter whether or not you're of Cook Islands background. They're there helping people in need, reflecting the generosity of spirit of Cook Islanders everywhere. I congratulate the volunteers who were there that day: Teela Komene, Nooroa and Terii Hagai, Tai Kairua, Justin Tautua, Danteus Roberts-Tugaga, Papa Maata Moeroa and Anita Tugaga. Congratulations, one and all. You're outstanding community members and it was an honour to be in your company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The week before, I attended another celebration, which was for Fijian Independence Day—again, another great community event, on this occasion celebrating Fiji's independence, which occurred on 10 October 1970. Senators present in the chamber will know that Australia has a very deep bond with Fiji, and this is exemplified by the Fiji-Australia Vuvale Partnership which has been entered into during the term of the Scott Morrison government. There was a wonderful dinner on the Friday night, and I was given the great honour of participating in traditional Fijian welcome ceremonies, including the drinking of kava, which I must say I quite enjoy. I actually quite enjoy a drink of kava, especially when it's in such wonderful company. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of that night and the cultural and sports celebrations the next day, a total of $5,000 was raised for a project undertaken by the International Women's Association in Fiji to provide cloth nappies and other essentials to new mothers in Fiji. It was a great example of our Pacific island diasporas working together to raise funds to send back to their island homes. I congratulate everyone involved in that event. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were many elders of the community in attendance. In particular, I'd like to pay tribute to the President of the Fiji Community Association of Queensland Inc., Dr Vilaseri Tuicolo. Dr Tuicolo is an obstetrician. He provides outstanding medical services, especially in regional Queensland, and he's a great leader of the Fijian diaspora. I also pay tribute to the Honorary Consul of Fiji in Brisbane, Mr Hari Raniga. The Raniga family has made an outstanding contribution, in both Fiji and Australia, through community work and business work. Honorary Consul, you should be congratulated for your efforts and those of your family. It was an honour to hear the story of your family and all that you contribute to the wellbeing of Fiji and Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My good friend Ratu Alifereti Maseinawa was the sports and cultural convener. Ratu, you did a magnificent job pulling it all together. You're a great Queenslander, and your leadership in helping to pull together the sports and cultural day was just outstanding. It was great to spend time in your company on Saturday. I also want to congratulate Mosese Rauluni, who was involved in organising the rugby sevens, along with Kelevi Tuicolo and Donna Lobendahn. Thank you to the dinner conveners, Kathy Harry Jaeger, Donnalyn Sing, Susana Bartlett and Donna Lobendahn; the soccer organiser, Raj Rao; the cultural festival organisers, Pate Ganita and Netani Lesi; the organisers of the children's activities, Valami and Sera Roqica; and everyone else involved in putting on a wonderful cultural and sports celebration. It was just outstanding. So, in conclusion, I say to all my Fijian friends, the Fijian diaspora: Ni sa bula vinaka. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  It's been said that the Morrison government has a women problem, but I think it's more accurate to say that the women of Australia have a Morrison government problem. As we near the end of 2021 and edge closer to the next election, the women of Australia are asking themselves this: What have the Morrison government done for us? What positive change have they made to the lives of Australian women? What have they done to improve the jobs of Australian women? What have they done to fight the insecurity that Australian women still face today? The answer is: not nearly enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's track record when it comes to women is absolutely abysmal. Under this government, women have been neglected, disrespected and undervalued. Australian women have been neglected in the postpandemic recovery, and women's economic security is going backwards. Despite women being the hardest hit by the COVID pandemic, there is no plan to support women's jobs or women's wages, going forward. Throughout the pandemic, women have experienced higher levels of job loss and lost hours than men. Almost 30,000 more women than men have left the jobs market during the most recent lockdowns, because women are more likely to be employed in insecure, part-time work and because women are the majority in the industries that were hardest hit during COVID—industries like hospitality, tourism and the arts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the other end of the spectrum, in sectors like nursing, early childhood education and aged care, essential women workers have been completely neglected by this government. These are the women who kept our essential services running, day in, day out, despite facing personal risk themselves, and for these women there was no relief on the home front. Added to the already high levels of unpaid work was the challenge of home schooling. Millions of women across the country shared in the daily struggle to balance everything—working from home, increased housework, hours of home schooling and the seemingly never-ending sourcing of snacks for bored and hungry children. It left the women of Australia exhausted and burnt out. It has also left many women poorer, because to cope with the extra workload many Australian women reduced their hours or left the workforce altogether, and many of these women are not guaranteed to get these hours back as lockdowns ease. This reduction in income from lost jobs and reduced hours saw women forced to withdraw from their super accounts like never before to survive, super accounts which were already on average half the size of men's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has no idea what the women of Australia have contributed during this pandemic. The Prime Minister simply doesn't see it. As a result, the Morrison government has no plan for women in the economic recovery going forward. So, without a plan, women will see long fought for gains in equality go backwards—insecure work will get worse, the retirement savings gap is set to get worse and their earnings will go backwards. The women of Australia simply cannot afford a Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian women are sick of being disrespected by this government, as was demonstrated by the 100,000 women who marched outside parliament demanding that the government listen. But what was the Prime Minister's response to this public display of anger and frustration? He said that the protesters should be grateful because 'Not far from here, such marches, even now are being met with bullets'. The women of Australia however did not feel grateful. They felt angry, and they felt angry when it took this government 15 months to respond to the groundbreaking Respect@Work report. They felt angry when the government legislated only six of the 55 recommendations of that report, and they felt angry when the government voted against employers having to take active measures to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. These are all actions which would have shown that this government had some basic respect for the women of Australia, actions which would have shown that they listened, which would have shown that they were taking real action to ensure women are safe at work. But, really, what can we expect? This is, after all, a government where former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, not globally renowned for his respect for women, appointed himself the Minister for Women. This is a government led by a prime minister who defended the now fully disgraced Minister Christian Porter, a prime minister who was accused of victim blaming by sexual assault survivor Brittany Higgins, a prime minister who has told us all that he can only relate to women as the 'father of daughters'. The women of Australia deserve to be respected, not dismissed by their Prime Minister and by their government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women have long been undervalued for their essential work, and it's never been clearer under this government. At the same time as women have been disproportionately impacted by COVID, they were at the front lines delivering our essential services. And how has the Morrison government valued these essential workers? Let's look at the early childhood educators. Let's look at the aged-care workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the government stood up and declared a pink budget, pointing to announcements in aged care and child care, but how much of this is actually flowing to the pockets of the hundreds of thousands of women who work in these critical, essential sectors? Nothing. The government has refused to do anything meaningful to value the work of these professionals. They have refused to support the aged-care work value case that's running in the Fair Work Commission, despite the Fair Work Commissioner asking them to. We know that the wages for aged-care workers are just not enough to live on. We have heard time and time again from aged-care workers, like Cathy who came to the Senate Select Committee on Job Security and said the following: 'Who cares for the care worker? We're the working poor and have to retire below the poverty line. We look after your parents. Remember, we're the second last stop for your loved ones.' So who cares for the care workers? Well, not the Morrison government and certainly not the same Prime Minister who praised early educators as essential one day and then kicked them off JobKeeper the next, when early childhood educators were still seeing their hours cut because of enrolments being reduced, when early childhood educators were needed to ensure that other essential workers could go to work, all while working in an environment where it was impossible to socially distance, at the height of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has never valued the essential care sectors, which are dominated by women. After all, this is a government whose own members reportedly described early learning as 'outsourced parenting'. This is a government whose own members say that women should do this care work for love and not for a living wage. But these are two of the fastest-growing sectors of the Australian economy, sectors which between them employ around 500,000 workers, sectors which are facing workforce shortages of tens of thousands of workers, driven by low pay and lack of respect. I have heard from educators and aged-care workers, as recently as last week, who are thinking of leaving the jobs that they love simply because they can't afford to stay in them. So what is this government prepared to do about that? It seems, after eight long years, that the answer is absolutely nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government which continually disrespects women and their invaluable contribution to our economy and our community. Australian women contribute so much to this country, but their own government continues to neglect them. Their own government continues to disrespect them. Their own government continues to undervalue them and the work that they do. This government will never stand up for women, ever. This government never has stood up for women, ever. The women of Australia have made their judgement, and they have found this government wanting.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  [by video link] Over the next few weeks, health insurers around the country will be busy finalising their applications to hike up insurance premiums. Of course, it's exactly the same thing every year. Insurers ask for as much as they believe they can get away with. The Department of Health spends months knocking out the most egregious claims, and the minister dutifully announces that consumers are going to cop it once again but it all would have been much worse if not for his personal intervention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As usual, every Australian with private cover will spend March thinking about whether it's worth keeping before the hikes take effect in April. The vast majority will keep some form of coverage just to avoid a massive tax hit, but they do so reluctantly every year. They sense that something is fundamentally wrong with a system that forces them to buy a high-cost, low-value service just to avoid some tax. More and more Australians are voting with their feet and opting for the lowest-cost, lowest-value insurance products. This is a clear sign that they don't see much value in private coverage beyond tax relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see more Australians intentionally forgoing the tax benefits and opting out of private cover entirely. Many Australians, like me, grapple with the question of whether it's worth having private coverage and whether it's worth having anything more than the most basic level of cover. But that's an impossible question to answer. One reason is that our future health is simply unknowable. None of us has any idea if we'll have an accident, if we'll get sick or if we're destined to live a long and healthy life. Of course, we can look at the statistical data to get a sense of what tends to happen to people in our age group who share similar lifestyles to ours, but that only tells us about averages and tendencies; it says nothing about us specifically. Normally this uncertainty is the very reason that having insurance generally. We insure parcels against the risk of loss or theft. We insure our cars against the risk of accidents. We insure our homes against the risk of natural disasters. But what risks does private health insurance actually protect us against?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It can't possibly be the risk of protecting yourself or your family from medical or financial catastrophe, because that's not what private health cover really provides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As soon as you go to sign up for private health insurance you're confronted with a bewildering array of options, none of which simply covers everything. Even top-level coverage has exclusions, waiting periods, caps and other limitations. And, should you ever experience a catastrophe, you'll quickly learn that what you want or need and what your insurance covers are often very different things. We call it 'insurance' because it's really an elaborate scheme to partly discount a range of services you'll probably never need. It's a business that depends on confusing consumers, on massive taxpayer subsidies and on promising more than will ever be delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I sound cynical, that's because I am. I have spoken before about the horrible experiences of my late wife, Kristin, throughout her four-year cancer journey. What benefit did we get from having private health insurance? Very little. In theory, our coverage guaranteed a range of benefits that justified the huge amounts that we, along with millions of Australians, pay our insurers. But the reality was always different and always disappointing. In theory, private cover gave us a choice of specialist. In reality, it wasn't our choice; it was often our GP's choice. There is no way for patients to know whether our GPs are referring us to the top specialist in the country or just some mate they golf with. There are no data and no transparency about the performance, quality or cost of different health professionals. There is no way for patients to know whether they can trust the person who may hold their lives in their hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In theory, private cover gave us financial security—the comfort of knowing that we would not have to worry about money while going through the worst ordeal of our lives. In reality, my wife's operations alone left me out of pocket well and truly—way over $10,000 more than we got back. In theory, private cover also means access to premium facilities and care in private rooms in what you would think to be top-class hospitals staffed by the best nurses and allied health professionals on the market. In reality, you'd be a lot better off in Adelaide's public hospitals than in the many run-down private hospitals that we have here—and it's similar in other states. And you'd also be more likely to get a comfortable private room in a public hospital nowadays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have grown increasingly aware that the big promises of private health cover are untrustworthy. That's why we've seen the proliferation of extras in recent years—I suppose the insurers realise they have to give something back so people feel they are getting something for their money. But, even there, the insurers can't help themselves. Every time they expand the list of benefits available to their customers, they tighten eligibility, cap the benefits amounts and hike up the premiums. I wonder if there is a single private health insurance customer in this country who thinks their benefits are worthwhile—or a single one who doesn't feel a bit silly using their private cover to get a few dollars off the cost of a yoga mat. For years now, fewer Australians have been willing to pay for private health insurance—fewer people who see any value in those excessive premiums and empty promises. And, despite hiking premiums each year, health insurers are steadily becoming less profitable and less reputable—which is pretty remarkable given that the product, the service they are supposedly offering, is something that a lot of people want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From where I'm standing, it is clear that private health insurance is becoming unsustainable. It's unsustainable financially and it's unsustainable politically. Sooner or later, politicians will realise that there is growing support for stricter regulation of health insurers, growing support for cutting taxpayer support, growing support for blocking premium hikes, and growing support for expanding the ACCC's role so they are not just monitoring insurers but actively enforcing competition in the sector or even designing standardised products which must be offered by every insurer. That's the industry's current trajectory, but it doesn't have to go that way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the industry wants to change course and it wants to rebuild its customer base and rebuild its reputation, it can do this. It can make that choice, but it has to make changes. It has to rebuild our trust. Cut out all the nonsense—the caps, the limits, the useless basics and everything that is meant to confuse or mislead customers. Cut it all out and focus instead on delivering what Australians want and expect from health insurance—that is, a quality product that they can rely on in times of crisis. Make it easy for people to compare your offering with the competition's and make sure they can see that you deliver true value for money. I spent many years building businesses, and that's what it's all about: building trust and delivering value. That's the outcome I want for the private health insurance industry and that's the outcome Australians want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if the industry stay on this path, if they choose not to lift their game, I will be a strong voice, with many others, for intervention and regulation. I will call for all their subsidies to be stripped away and channelled back into the public health system, because the public health system generally is far more effective and often doing a better job than private health systems. I will also push for premium hikes to be blocked and for the ACCC to step in. So it is time private health really look at themselves and make appropriate changes for the benefit of us all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  On the front page of today's Courier Mail is a very alarming story that should concern every Queenslander as it is a bloody attack on democracy and free speech in Queensland. It's an attack that affects all 577 local government councillors and mayors across Queensland. The article reports how the Mayor of the Barcaldine Regional Council, Councillor Sean Dillon, is under investigation by the Orwellian Office of the Independent Assessor for comments he made at a council meeting back in February when he questioned the logistics of the vaccine rollout in rural communities. The council was discussing the Central West Hospital and Health Service, a division of Queensland Health, and its plan to vaccinate entire rural towns through one of its visits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To paraphrase the conversation, Councillor Dillon rightly raised his concerns about the Central West Hospital and Health Service's ability to vaccinate a majority of locals in the limited time. He raised particular concerns for individuals who had mobility issues or those who were unable to attend the local hall. Councillor Dillon was concerned that the health service probably hadn't considered those particular residents. Moreover, he lacked confidence in their ability to advertise the visits and was concerned about the logistical challenges of administering the jabs to the entire community. He said: 'Someone thinking they are going to do it in one pass is someone who has got no idea of regional Queensland. It's simply not going to work.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The OIA—the gestapo of local government in Queensland—is alleging that Councillor Dillon made comments that could be considered detrimental to public confidence in a health service provider and lead agency in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program in the region. It alleges Councillor Dillon has been reasonably suspected of inappropriate conduct for making statements in a public forum that are not in the best interests of the community. The last time I checked one of the primary roles of local government councillors is to raise concerns on behalf of their local community. Indeed, if councillors and mayors are not raising concerns on behalf of their local community, they are not doing their jobs. So I say well done to Councillor Dillon. I say well done to all councillors and all mayors across Queensland, regardless of your political colour, for continuing to stand up for your local communities. The comments made were undoubtedly valid concerns of the local community. So the mayor is simply being investigated for doing his job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke this morning to Councillor Dillon. He is expecting that the sandal-wearing jobsworths in the OIA will sack him. I've also spoken to the LGAQ, who are prepared to go to the High Court over this bloody attack on freedom of speech. This investigation is a blatant attack by the Queensland government on free speech. The OIA acts with minimal oversight or review and is used for nothing more than whipping up frivolous complaints that take an inordinate amount of time to investigate and cost local councils and local ratepayers thousands of dollars to defend. So who is watching the watchdog? We have had the CCC Logan case and now we have the Office of the Independent Assessor or, as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courier Mail</span> rather amusingly calls them, the 'office of idiot actions'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a senator, I speak to lots of councillors and mayors across Queensland, and here are some of the concerns from councillors. Investigations take too long. Many go for two years, and the office of independent assessment has no benchmark or timeliness for reporting. Not enough frivolous or vexatious complaints get knocked out at the assessment stage. Trivial matters like people being blocked on the council Facebook page for making derogatory comments end up going through the OIA and sent back to council to deal with. Both sides lawyer up and it costs councils thousands and thousands of dollars to deal with the complaint, not to mention the time it takes away from councils and councillors when they want to be dealing with the real issues in their communities. Councillors who have had their cases dismissed still end up being publicly reported on a register.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this gestapo organisation only starting back in December 2018, some matters go back almost a decade. The state government will say they are independent, which is a cop-out. They were established by the state government, by legislative amendments in the Local Government Act, with very little, if any, oversight. They are nothing more than a self-serving money pit who go around the state whipping up complaints. They told one council that it wasn't a good thing that there were no complaints being made in that area because people obviously didn't know about the OIA or how to make a complaint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This mob need to be reined in, they need more oversight in the legislation or, ideally, they actually should be abolished. Councillors are now afraid to make decisions or talk about issues in their community, and that is what they were elected to do. Councils are the most local form of government. They are the ones closest to the community. We need to be supporting councils, not making it tougher for people to stand up and be elected representatives in their local areas. Not only were Counsellor Dillon's concerns valid but this latest fiasco is yet another example of Palaszczuk turning Queensland into a nanny state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about Palaszczuk, whose state Labor government continues to fail regional Queensland, I want to talk about Paradise Dam. Every sitting fortnight I talk about Paradise Dam because state Labor are doing nothing about it. Unfortunately for the farmers affected by what is effectively a neutron bomb that has gone off in Wide Bay-Burnett with the destruction of Paradise Dam through the lowering of its wall, there is no good news. Do you know what is left for the farmers in Wide Bay-Burnett to do? Just pray for rain. That is what's left in Queensland: praying for rain. They don't build dams under state Labor; they just pray for rain. I say well done to Tom Marland from Marland Law, who is leading the Paradise Dam class action. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With such low water allocations and no certainty about the future of the dam, farmers are left with few options but to pray for rain to keep their crops alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shame on state Labor for doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everybody here knows that I am a big fan of the ABC. I believe that the best friend you can ever have is an honest friend, and I am very honest about the ABC. I have previously talked about my reform program for the ABC, but clearly the ABC aren't listening. So I am calling upon the minister for communications to commission a commission of inquiry into whether there is a need for public broadcasting in Australia, with specific reference to the ABC, its operation and its charter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC is like a lost teenager, aimlessly floating through time and trying to find itself, unperturbed by authority, yet infatuated with its own self-importance. In the absence of any serious review over the previous decades, the ABC has evolved into a self-serving bureaucracy that is out of touch with many Australians and that costs the Australian taxpayers $1.1 billion a year. After all, since the 1930s, when the ABC was first created, it has never been beyond the reproach of government review or reform, so why should it be now?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we need the urgent commission of an inquiry into public broadcasting and the ABC. In particular, we need to determine the ABC's applicability in the 21st century, with reference to how large the national broadcaster should be and to what extent they should compete in the modern media market. The review must define what is and what is not acceptable by a public broadcaster which effectively upholds the Australian taxpayer as a beneficiary of the ABC. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The review will need to accommodate for the ABC charter to be reformed to make it fit for purpose. In doing so, the review can serve as a mechanism to cut through the bureaucracy and minimise any waste of taxpayers' money. Refining the scope of the ABC's operations will promote strict purpose metrics that will demand compliance and mitigate any existing lack of priority for everyday Australians. Any aspect of the ABC's operation that falls outside these purpose metrics should be consolidated, privatised or cease operating. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot of discussion in this building and in the other place about net zero emissions by 2050. Last night, I talked about why we should build the Tully Millstream hydroelectric scheme. But if you're really serious about net zero emissions by 2050, we should have nuclear power in Australia. Back in 2019, the member for Hinkler and I wrote to the Prime Minister calling for an inquiry into nuclear energy in Australia. Now, as we are building a roadmap to net zero emissions by 2050, I am calling upon the government to make sure that nuclear energy is part of that roadmap. We've got a third of the world's uranium and we are geologically stable. It is in our national interest to make sure that we have nuclear energy in this country to provide affordable, cheap and reliable power as part of our energy mix.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  I rise to speak about a virus that has destroyed the lives and livelihoods of decent, hardworking Australians. That virus is, of course, Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas, and his executive leadership. Yesterday, SafeWork NSW filed criminal charges against Qantas over the sacking of Theo Seremetidis. Let me tell you about Theo. Theo was an aircraft cleaner who had worked for Qantas. Theo was a trained, qualified and experienced health and safety representative for his team. Theo had worked in Qantas for almost seven years when COVID-19 began to spread around the world. In early 2020, before our borders closed to China, planes continued to arrive at Australia's airports from COVID-19 hotspots, including Wuhan. Theo and his team were responsible for cleaning those planes. I will quote Theo directly on what happened next:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the start of the pandemic, we were directed to clean planes with just water—no sanitiser for the trays or anything. PPE was not mandated despite managers wearing hazmat suits. We were not even provided with masks or disinfectant. I made numerous approaches to management to ask for further PPE or for the risk assessments they had done. After everything was declined, I directed a group of workers to cease unsafe work, which is one of the health and safety representative powers … At the same time, I and other workers received threats of disciplinary action. That day I was stood down was my last day at Qantas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is truly a national scandal. Alan Joyce was forcing his own employees to clean planes arriving from Wuhan without PPE, without disinfectant and with nothing more than spray bottles of water. The Qantas management was so concerned that they were wearing hazmat suits, but they didn't provide any PPE to the exposed cleaning team. Theo stood up not just to protect himself and not just to protect his team but to protect every Australian who was unknowingly boarding a Qantas plane that had not been safely disinfected. For his trouble, Alan Joyce stood him down immediately. Theo has never gone back to work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months later, Theo was one of the 2,000 Qantas workers who woke up to learn their jobs had been outsourced, in the middle of a pandemic, at the same time that Qantas was receiving $2 billion in public money to keep the workforce intact. Alan Joyce outsourced those jobs to cut costs, to cut wages and to cut conditions for his employees. Some of these workers had been working for Qantas for many, many decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, many of the companies he outsourced those jobs to are notorious for their poor labour standards. One, Swissport, was subject to an expose by the ABC which revealed its workers are living in makeshift camps in Sydney airport between split shifts. That's how low their wages are, and those are their conditions. Swissport workers were sleeping on sheets on the concrete floor and on dirty mattresses beneath baggage carousels. Last week, Qantas appeared before the job security inquiry. I asked whether Qantas even knows whether the outsourced workers it uses are receiving a living wage. The response I received was telling: Qantas's chief counsel responded, 'What's a living wage?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This illegal outsourcing is another national scandal. The Federal Court agrees, which is why it has ruled that this outsourcing decision was illegal. It wasn't simply a right, as has been claimed by those opposite—in particular by Senator Stoker, who made criticisms of these workers because they had failed to keep their jobs with Qantas. She criticised those workers because they had decent wages and conditions that had been negotiated, many without any action, directly with the company. That company signed off willingly and then turned around, double-crossed the workers and did such deals as it did.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SHELDON:</span>
                  </a>  I can tell you this, Senator Stoker: I would suggest you go back through <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, because I certainly will. The Federal Court agrees, which is why it has ruled the outsourcing decision was illegal, Senator Stoker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There aren't enough hours in the day to go through the long list of crimes that Alan Joyce has committed against his employees. I'm thinking now about Peter Seymour, and I ask those opposite to consider this story. Peter had worked at Qantas for 31 years when he was diagnosed with stage 5 prostate cancer in late 2019. Peter continued working as long as he could before, in early 2020, he was eventually forced onto sick leave. At this point, Peter was getting radiotherapy treatment almost every day. When the pandemic reached Australia, Alan Joyce booted Peter off the sick leave he had accrued over 31 years at Qantas. He was stood down and, when he tried to recover that sick leave, Qantas fought Peter, a cancer victim, in the Federal Court. Peter said that he had been forced to borrow money from family members to pay his medical bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Alan Joyce has done to Peter, Theo and those 2,000 workers who saw their jobs illegally outsourced is un-Australian. The ACCC should be investigating Qantas for false advertising over its use of the tagline 'Spirit of Australia'. Alan Joyce said he needed to sack those 2,000 people to save Qantas. Well, I say we only need to sack one, and that is Alan Joyce. Instead, he continues to pocket millions of dollars year after year, regardless of the performance of the company. Of course, we've seen subsidies squeezed out of taxpayers and the Qantas workforce as part of his strategy of bonuses. When are the Morrison government going to utter a single word in defence of workers like Peter and Theo? I won't hold my breath.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's quite clear is that the prosecution is the first of its kind anywhere in Australia under the uniform WH&amp;S laws. TWU NSW state secretary Richard Olsen said that the regulator's decision to prosecute Qantas was 'a landmark moment for health and safety across Australia'. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">SafeWork's prosecution of Qantas for these offences is the first of its kind and is a massive step forward for work health and safety in NSW and across the nation … Qantas stood Theo down simply for trying to protect himself and his colleagues from COVID, and now the company is rightly facing criminal charges for doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said this was the same company that had been found, as I said, to have illegally dismissed those 2,000 workers, and he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We hope the Court throws the book at Qantas for their outrageous decision to stand down a worker who was simply trying to keep himself and his colleagues safe at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the number of charges laid is unknown, each offence attracts a maximum penalty of $594,000.21, meaning that Qantas could face fines running into the millions, not including any compensation potentially awarded to Mr Seremetidis. The case is listed for its first hearing in the New South Wales District Court on 6 December. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to SafeWork prosecution, Qantas is also facing an adverse action case in the Federal Court brought by the TWU relating to Theo's being stood down, as well as the separate ongoing Federal Court case about Qantas's illegal decision to outsource 2,000 workers. A SafeWork NSW spokesperson says the charges relate to QGS standing down a worker who raised concerns about a potential exposure of workers to COVID-19 while cleaning aircraft in early 2020. The TWU have put forward that they believe that the prosecution is the first of its kind anywhere in the country. They went on to talk about the importance of making sure that this adverse action is properly dealt with in the courts. This company could turn over a new leaf. It could actually do what predecessors to Alan Joyce did and engage with the workforce, have a relationship with the workforce, a workforce that took standdowns without pay on many occasions during crises, but not at the point of a gun. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  We're now into hour 70,100 of the longest-running soap opera in Australian politics, and that is the soap opera of the Liberal and National parties trying to work out where they stand on climate change and net zero emissions. As I said on ABC Capricornia radio today, this soap opera has been running so long that it makes <span style="font-style:italic;">Days of Our Lives </span>seem like a miniseries. This has been going on for the entire life of this government, and the only people who are losing out as a result of this government's failure to deal with this issue are regional Australians, who are seeing jobs that should be going into our regions disappear offshore to countries who are getting ahead of us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear: this pantomime that we are seeing in Canberra this week—where we have Liberals fighting Liberals, Liberals fighting Nationals, Nationals fighting Liberals, Nationals fighting Nationals—is a farce. We all know that the government is going to reach net zero emissions. Senator Abetz must be just shaking in his boots about the fact that he has built his political career on fighting against climate change action and he knows that the government is going to sign up to it. He knows that this is a foregone conclusion and he knows that those people from the National Party who are carrying on day in, day out, are just playing up for the cameras and yet again are going to prove that they are completely inadequate when it comes to the task of representing our regions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: the government's net zero emissions plan, which is coming any day now, is a fake plan from a fake Prime Minister, supported by fake farmers and fake miners. This is a government full of fakes from top to bottom. Senator Canavan at least had the decency to call it out yesterday when he pointed out that this government's slogan 'Technology not taxes' is complete crap, complete rubbish, completely meaningless. He likened it to rainbows and puppies. So, for every minister that we see get up in question time today and rabbit on about technology not taxes, just substitute rainbows and puppies. That's what they're talking about and that's what they've been called out for by one of their own members. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Net zero is not the only example where we see the Nationals letting down our regions. They have let down their regions even on regional development grants, where it's just been revealed that more than half of this government's regional development grants have gone to the major cities. One of these regional development grants went to that famous regional football club called Collingwood. That's how regional this National Party government is when it comes to supporting the regions. They've let down the regions on casualisation, they've let down the regions on disaster management and they've let down the regions on GPs and aged care, and now they're doing it again by letting jobs disappear. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Thank you for taking the time to write about such an important issue, Sujaan. I can't wait to see you in politics in years to come. Here is Sujaan's speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Hi. I'm Sujaan, I'm 11 and I am from the Canberra electorate. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Can you think back to when you were my age, and what you wanted the world to look like in 20 years' time?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">You might have imagined flying cars, or hoverboards, or a world where everyone has access to healthy food and clean water. But would you have imagined the only living structure you can spot from outer space, our very own Great Barrier Reef to be at risk of dying because of carbon in the atmosphere?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The current generation of adults needs to fix the problems in today's world, so when people of my generation are adults we don't have to spend our time fixing the problems that we have now. We will have to spend our time solving problems or inventing new ways to do things in the future which we haven't even begun to imagine yet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There are small things we can all do, like not littering, turning off lights when you leave the room and not buying products containing palm oil. But there are bigger things that people and governments can do to reduce the destruction of nature. For example, encouraging everyone to use renewable energy sources and making sure forests and natural areas are better protected from logging and deforestation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In 20 years, I want to be able to see a world where no one is destroying forests, killing wildlife, and releasing CO2 into the atmosphere.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">When you were young, did you hope the leaders would do a better job to help fulfill your hopes about the future? Now that you're the leaders, do you think you could help the children of our generation to fulfill ours?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Some 3,139 Australians lost their lives to suicide last year. That's about nine Australians every day. On top of that stark figure, a staggering 65,000 attempted suicide in 2020. One of the risk factors for suicide is relationship breakdown. Research confirms that separated people have a higher risk of attempting suicide and developing suicidal thoughts. In short, relationship breakdowns have their consequences. They are real, they are deep and they are potentially very destructive. That's the bad news. The good news is Parents Beyond Breakup.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents Beyond Breakup is a national suicide prevention charity focused on supporting separating parents experiencing trauma through family breakdown. This charity has effectively gone about its vital task for two decades. One wonders what the statistics would be without their highly effective work. Under the able leadership of Brendan Blomeley and CEO Gillian Hunt, Parents Beyond Breakup is making a real difference, keeping separating parents alive and in their children's lives by providing hope, support and a voice.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents Beyond Breakup has an impressive delivery model based on lived experience. It only supports separated parents and grandparents in distress through relationship breakdown and child access issues. It ensures the safety of parents coming to groups, and in the last year it has supported for 1,451 face-to-face engagements, 1,429 online engagements and 1,778 helpline calls. Parents Beyond Breakup does wonderful restorative work. It deserves our support.</span>

It has been wonderful to hear my colleagues across the chamber read out so many heartfelt and articulate statements from young people setting out their vision for 2041. I'm delighted today to be able to share this speech from Gillian Gerry. Gillian is a 21-year-old student from Brisbane who is currently studying commerce and politics at the University of Canberra and who hopes one day to be standing in this chamber herself, but only if the toxic culture changes. Gillian says: '"A lying cow", "stop shagging men", "a menopausal monster", "deliberately barren"—these remarks would be reprimandable in any ordinary workplace, so why on our parliamentary floor are they acceptable? Picture this, a young girl in a study of society class being told that, as of 2015, female representation in parliament was a mere 30 per cent, and all the media could care about what the way each of these women looked—too old, frumpy, ugly, a slut. She took this as her call to action. Campaign after campaign says the future is female, yet we sit here hoping that women's interest in politics will simply reignite after she's had children, once she's finished in the workforce or after her duties as a Stepford wife at complete. Meanwhile, all she reads are derogatory headlines. Currently, there are young women, like myself, willing and ready to take on the call to action, but our concern is the Australian commentary. A young man, he has ambition. But a young woman, what could she possibly know about the world. Picture this, in 20 years, nothing has changed in our political sphere. That is a call to action.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you for letting me share your powerful words and your call to action, Gillian. I, along with my Greens colleagues, hear you, and we'll keep working to make this place somewhere young women know is a place for them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I'm proud to give this speech by Arya Moodley as part of the Youth Voice in Parliament Week campaign. It is a sentiment that I very much agree with. In the words that she gives the chamber today, she says: 'My name is Arya Moodley, I am 16 years old, and the electorate of Curtin is my home, the land of the Wadjak Noongar people. It is a place that I am proud to call home. My vision for Australia is that, in the next 20 years, we will have our first female Prime Minister of colour. As a young woman, a person of colour and of migrant parents, I believe that diverse leadership is paramount. Diversity is a powerful tool for unity, a symbol that we have evolved and are ready to invite the most marginalised to the table and celebrate their attributes. For this vision to be a reality, we need action; we need to empower that young girl out there now through education so that in 20 years, she will confidently stand on a national stage. We need to close the gap, ensuring that the government provides equitable resources so that no girl, no woman, no individual is disadvantaged by their geographical location or their ethnicity. We need, as a society, to change our perception of women in politics so that we foster an inclusive environment that lifts them rather than one that tears them down. It is through education, equity and positive role models that we will allow that young girl of colour in 20 years to represent the great country of Australia.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  How would Australia fare under a Greens government? In 'Greensland', water will be limited to 120 litres per day, per person. After that, smart meters will shut the water off. With no water allowed for gardening, home gardens will die. Rural restrictions will shut down family farms. Productive land will be used to farm carbon, breeding feral pests and noxious weeds, not food.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' policy of a smaller farming footprint will lead to big corporations centralising near-city production of food-like substances sold through corporate supermarkets. End-to-end corporate supply chains will exploit this monopoly to create deliberate shortages and raise prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' policy of unlimited immigration will make these shortages of everything worse to enable more government control. Family homes will be turned into so-called environmentally friendly small homes—boxes—stacked in high-rise blocks in megacities with mass transit replacing the freedom of private car ownership. Travel for recreation will be limited to interurban travel; the bush locked up and returned to the gyre. Electricity will be rationed. Smart meters will remotely switch off unauthorised activity. Real wages will fall as businesses increase prices to meet rising power bills, brown-outs and green imposts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Greensland, gender is not related to genitals and can change daily unless a child permanently changes their gender from one to the other using gender mutilation surgery. The inconsistency of that logic escapes the Greens. Sex education will start in kindergarten and drive the Greens war on gender. The Greens are blindly advocating forced vaccinations that enrich foreign drug companies. My Body, My Choice is no longer a Greens's value. Greens-land is a world of total corporate control without freedom, without joy, without opportunity—a dystopian nightmare for our families and our communities.</span>

I rise to congratulate Better Together Community Support in Atherton in Far North Queensland on their successful application to the Building Better Regions Fund and to highlight just how important these grants are to our smaller towns. Building Together is a vital service in Atherton, providing domestic violence support, counselling and online psychology sessions, family mediation, youth programs, suicide prevention, and drug and alcohol awareness, just to name some. CEO John Russell and board members such as former regional Mayor Joe Paronella, David Duncan and Graham Wardle have been tireless in their desire to expand and improve our new community centre, which the town sorely needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to say that, thanks to the Building Better Regions Fund, a $2.2 million contribution will be made to a $4.4 million dollar project to build a fit-for-purpose community centre in the Atherton Tableland. Criticism has been made of these grants, describing them as purely political. Well, try telling that to the grateful recipients. I will never stop fighting for local councils, especially when their local member doesn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These councils don't have the rates base to afford all the facilities that make their areas more liveable for residents and attractive to tourists. They need representatives in Canberra to constantly push their case for town improvements so they can concentrate on budgeting for other core responsibilities. Effective representation isn't about self-promotion or blaming others for your failures; it's about delivering for people who need it most.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  [by video link] If there's one area where this government is absolutely world-class it is in creating solutions to problems that don't exist. Take the new charities regulation ACNC 2021 Measures No. 2. These apparently solve a problem of uncertainty when charities commit minor legal infractions. It's not something the public have raised, it's not even something the charities are worried about and it's not even something the regulator has called for, but this government has bravely soldiered on and created a solution for a non-problem. Not surprisingly, they've managed to botch it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulations mean charities will be deregistered if officers commit some re-offences or if a charity's resources are used in offences. A charity can also be deregistered if the regulator thinks they may break the laws. So charities will have to steer clear of any work where there is even a risk of minor legal infractions. That means no involvement with protests, no involvement with civil disobedience and no involvement with anyone released from prison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In solving a problem that doesn't exist, the government has created huge new problems. There is a real frustration with this. There are genuine problems with the charities and non-profit sectors. There are dodgy non-profits out there—organisations set up purely to exploit the generosity of Australians—but that is where the government really should be focused. Instead, we get these other measures which will harm legitimate charities and make it harder for them to do their good work. A disallowance motion has already been circulated, and I hope the Senate joins me in voting down these harmful and unnecessary regulations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  [by video link] Today I am so proud to be giving a speech written by Shania Gamble, from Adelaide, as part of Youth Voice in Parliament Week. Here's Shania's speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As of 2021, the Australian population accounts for approximately 13 million females.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Of this population, an average of 306,000 have given birth to a child this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My name is Shania Gamble, I am 20 years old, and contribute to the population that support women in their birth as a student midwife.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have been inspired, amazed, appalled, and disappointed at times observing the care women receive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The health system needs help, going backwards isn't an option and standing still is not enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In 20 years, I envision Australia to improve the care of the 13 million women in their pursuit to start a family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My passion for helping women in the most vulnerable time of their life may not be enough however, improved resources for maternity care can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I raise my voice for the women who sit in waiting rooms for hours because there isn't enough staff to attend to her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For the parents who want the same midwife throughout their pregnancy but cannot because they 'didn't make the cut'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For the unborn babies who deserve the brightest future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Women will continue to give birth for the rest of time, how long are we going to deprive them of the care they deserve?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  [by video link] I would like, at this moment, to contribute also to the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign that seeks to bring into this place youth voices that are so urgently needed. I read now a speech on behalf of Winter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My name is Winter and I'm a 17 year old from Tangney, Western Australia. There are many aspects of the Australian experience that I wish to see evolve, but there is one area that I am particularly hopeful to see change in the next 20 years. I have spent my highschool years surrounded by some of the most wonderful people, many of whom happen to be queer, trans, non-binary, or otherwise gender diverse. And I have watched them, my friends struggle to be accepted and have their feelings and identities taken seriously. I am hoping that as a society we can normalise the non-conformity to gender norms, as well as increase the availability and normality of gender neutral bathrooms. Similarly, I hope to see increased funding for services that provide gender diverse youth with guidance and acceptance so that they may live a life that feels authentic and fulfilling to them. Through facilitating societal evolution in this way I hope to see that the youth 20 years from now will not have to struggle, as my friends have, to find acceptance and understanding from Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Winter. Thank you for your words and your courage in putting them forward to parliament today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In 20 years' time I hope that Australia continues to be a place of equality; where people treat each other with respect and kindness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I value the way people treat each other, and the way the Government treats people because it is so different to the way it was in my home country (Afghanistan).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When I lived in Afghanistan I could not study or go outside alone; women do not have the same rights as men. Australia gives women and girls the opportunity to study and work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am excited for my future and what I can achieve in the next 20 years in Australia and hope to be a businesswoman one day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I hope that Australia continues to provide these opportunities to everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I hope that in 20 years every city in Australia has a high school that operates the same way as Thebarton Senior College. Many young people arrive in Australia when they are past the age of being able to attend mainstream schools, or experience barriers to education that mean they miss out and might want to study again when they are a bit older. Being able to  attend a flexible but supportive school environment that treats them like adults, but at the same time gives them a supportive school experience is so beneficial. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I would also change the legal age that people can buy cigarettes, vapes and alcohol. I believe that 18 is too young, and that increasing the age would help prevent young people from accessing harmful substances.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The recent announcement of the new regional security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States is a testament to our ability to bring such nations together in defending our sovereign interests, but many questions still remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I lament the typical bungling of the coalition's handling of the Future Submarine program, I nonetheless also welcome the prospect of the acquisition of a nuclear-propelled submarine fleet for the Royal Australian Navy and the role that these vessels will play in the Asia-Pacific and Antarctic regions. The transition away from diesel-electric to nuclear propulsion for Australian submarines represents a significant challenge; however, having spent some time aboard HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Collins</span> with Senator Hughes, who is also here in the chamber, I also know that our submariners will welcome the opportunity to meet this task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The development of advanced submarines also promises new opportunities for Australian industry. It is my hope that, by demonstrating the capacity of industry to put this new technology to sea, we might also come to appreciate the opportunities it presents outside of a defence context, as many, including the Australian Workers Union, have advocated, because there is no denying that our prosperity in the future will depend on our ability to access cheap, abundant energy to power the Australian economy in a clean and emissions-free manner, and the peaceful atom, as it has been termed, may very well have a role to play in achieving this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  This month is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I would like to pay tribute to the Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation, which is a Newcastle based and founded not-for-profit organisation which provides support services for both men and women living with breast cancer in the Hunter region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation is incredibly passionate about delivering the best level of support and services to those who are dealing with the effects of breast cancer. During the pandemic, they've been busier than ever. While many charities and support services went into hibernation over the pandemic, they've had one of their busiest years ever. They provide extensive, practical support services for those who are dealing with the effects of breast cancer. This includes patient transport, house cleaning and lawn mowing but also wigs and headwear. They've seen a significant increase in services and client numbers. They've had an 80 per cent increase in the number of people supported just this year alone—that's over 135 people—with over 600 services delivered this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 20,000 Australians will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year—that's around 55 every day—and, sadly, more than 3,000 of them will lose their life to breast cancer this year. Organisations like the Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation are vital to supporting our communities. I commend them for their ongoing support and dedication to the Hunter Community. I encourage all men and, in particular, women to have those check-ups early and regularly, because early detection is the best cure.</span>

In 1975, as the war was ending in Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge took control in Cambodia and embarked on a horrific campaign of executions, displacement and forced labour in which nearly two million were murdered or died of disease and starvation. The invasion of Vietnamese forces in 1979 drove Pol Pot's regime from power but began a new decade of destructive civil war. With the country desperately divided internally, and ASEAN, China, Russia and the United States all supporting different sides, the conflict proved utterly intractable—until Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, identified a new way forward, in 1989, built around giving the United Nations an unprecedented role in governing the country in its transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The detailed plan that Gareth and his department drafted—and pursued with relentless diplomacy, working closely with Indonesia in particular—culminated in the Paris Peace Agreements signed by 19 countries on 23 October 1991. These agreements are among the greatest achievements of Australian foreign policy. As Gareth Evans said at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Peace and freedom are not prizes which, once gained, can never be lost. They must be won again each day. Their foundations must be sunk deep into the bedrock of political stability, economic prosperity and, above all, the observance of human rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, we still hope that the achievement of peace can be matched, as has not been the case so far, with the achievements of democratic pluralism, inclusion and respect for human rights for all Cambodians. Australia takes inspiration from the courage and resilience of the Cambodian people and will always be a strong supporter of their aspirations for not only a durable peace but a just peace.</span>

I stand before you this afternoon to congratulate the Indian Society of Western Australia on the official opening of the first Indian community centre in Western Australia, and I'm delighted that $2.5 million was able to be provided by the coalition government in support of this community centre. For 50 years the Indian community in Western Australia has been dreaming of having its own home. I'm delighted that the coalition government—supported by me and Ben Morton, the member for Tangney—has been able to bring this dream alive for such a wonderful diaspora in Western Australia.</span>

Having established a new Indian centre in Willetton, which my Western Australian colleagues would know is south of the river, I'm delighted to be the first person to begin arguing for an Indian centre north of the river so that the wonderful Indian diaspora can continue to celebrate its rich culture by providing language rooms and performance centres for all of its wonderful people. I congratulate the Indian Society on their great work and leadership in bringing this very worthy community project alive.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're doing, as a political party, is carefully considering the proposal before us, and this proposal will set up a net zero position for our country over the next three decades. It's only right and proper that the party that represents miners, foresters, fishers, manufacturing workers, farmers and those who live out in rural and regional Australia assesses the impact of this decision on our communities. And that impact is not just between now and the next election and not just between now and our own political careers but between now and the three decades when this policy will be rolled out and will have impact. We're doing that in a calm, methodical way. We're doing it on behalf of the regions. It is the right and proper process to go through. Our party room has primacy in this. It's not the leader having a top-down approach on what should or shouldn't happen to our communities or what should and shouldn't happen to our industries; it is each and every MP and senator feeding into the leadership group what they think will be the implications and what their views are, and we're taking those forward as a group.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vocational education and training is something that employers are looking for in prospective employees. It ensures that they are work ready from day one. The Morrison government are well and truly investing in a world-class vocational education and training system. Our government, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, invested approximately $6 billion in skills funding. This was the largest single investment ever to occur in vocational education and training in Australia. As a government, we recognise the benefits of vocational education and training, and that is why we are now investing an additional $6.4 billion over the 2021-22 financial year. So what we now see from the Morrison government is an investment of over $12 billion in skills funding since the start of the pandemic.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>What this means is that, whilst other countries have actually shed their apprentice workforces, what we have seen in Australia, particularly because of the successful Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements program that we put in place, is that the number of new apprentices in Australia has increased by 141.5 per cent year on year. That is because of the investments that the Morrison coalition government has put in place to ensure that we were helping those businesses who wanted to keep their apprentices keep them on but also that those businesses who wanted to bring on apprentices had the right policies in place to do that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">red)</span></span>

This is a highly successful program, and what we've now seen is around 224,000 Australians taking on apprenticeships right across Australia. What we've also seen now is that over 77,000 businesses have successfully utilised this program, taking on another apprentice or, in the case of some businesses, being able to grow their business and take on multiple apprentices. What we do under the program is that businesses who take on a new apprentice now get 50 per cent of that apprentice's wage, up to $7,000 per quarter, subsidised by the government for a period of 12 months. Businesses out there have until 31 March 2022 to take advantage of this wage subsidy.</span>

We have now expanded this successful program, the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy, with an additional $716 million. That is because we understand that you put in place those policies that employers can lever off to grow their workforces. They can bring on apprentices. They can bring on trainees. They can offer Australians the opportunity to be trained to be work ready from day one. We have seen, with the number of businesses who've accessed the policies and the number of Australians who've been given an opportunity across Australia, that this is a highly successful program. Again, we've put in place policies that employers can lever off so that they can get the pipeline of skilled workers that they need.</span>

Obviously, as you would expect, all ministers in the Morrison-Joyce government accept their responsibilities in relation to their obligations under the ministerial code and take them very, very seriously. However, Minister Pitt has made a number of comments in relation to issues that he feels very strongly about, and obviously he has the right to make those comments and those decisions. But, of course, as a government, we remain absolutely committed to sticking together.</span>

I think she's probably very relieved that she's only had one question today. I thought that you might have continued with your track record this week of asking Senator McKenzie every question from that side of the chamber. But the one thing that this government, the National Party and the Liberal Party in coalition, does is that we work together respectfully to make sure that we deal with the issues that are important to all Australians—Australians that live in the city and Australians that live in rural and regional areas—because it is incumbent on all governments to make sure that we canvass the concerns of every Australian when we make very important policy decisions.</span>

We have seen, through the responses that you have received from Senator McKenzie over the recent days, just how respectful that conversation is. And I can assure you that we will continue to have a respectful conversation with the people of Australia on this very, very important policy decision on our climate policy going forward, because it matters to Australians. It matters to them what this is going to cost and it matters how we plan to get there. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>) </span>

Minister Pitt is in the outer ministry. However, as I have said, as Senator McKenzie has said and as so many people on this side of the chamber have said, we are having a respectful conversation about our plan to get to a clean energy future. We understand our obligations in relation to emissions reduction, but we understand that there are obligations to the Australian public. Our obligation is to make sure that we don't tax them out of existence, that we do not add a financial burden to household energy bills, that we don't add a burden to businesses that puts them at a competitive disadvantage to the rest of the world and that we ensure that we actually protect Australian jobs in all sectors. We are absolutely committed to delivering what we said we were going to deliver, but we will do it through technology. We are not going to tax the Australian population and economy out of existence.</span>

Today, the New South Wales ICAC has received explosive evidence from a frank and fearless public servant about the dodgy clay target grant for the 'Maguire international shooting centre of excellence'. It's reminiscent of sports rorts, 'pork and ride' and all the other times the Audit Office has repeatedly found that the government prioritised coalition and marginal seats in grant funding in the lead-up to the last election. Why is your government's model for a corruption body designed to not be able to look back at the misuse of public funds? Is it because half your cabinet have been implicated in integrity scandals?</span>

Again, we have undertaken an extensive consultation process. This is an important piece of legislation. It is important that we get the details of the legislation right. That is why the government released the exposure draft of the legislation. That is why we are considering the 333 written submissions to take on board the feedback. And, as I have already articulated, the feedback that we have received will now inform the further refinement of this draft legislation.</span>

We know how important child care is for thousands of Australian families, and that's why the Morrison government has delivered a targeted, measured childcare package that is keeping out-of-pocket expenses low and allowing more parents to work should they chose. Average out-of-pocket costs are now just around $4 per hour, almost 18 per cent lower before our childcare package was introduced more than three years ago. The mechanism we introduced to restrain fee growth, the cap on hourly fees, is also working with 86.2 per cent of services charging below that cap. But we know that these costs still add up when you have two, three or more children in care at the same time, so we're bringing forward an additional support for around 250,000 families with two or more children in care. These families will receive an additional 30 per cent subsidy covering up to 95 per cent of their costs. So a family earning $110,000 a year with two kids in care four days a week would be better off by around $100 a week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we'd introduce this earlier if we could, and now we are delivering. The work we've done to ensure that the IT framework is ready and in place and centres will be prepared is under way. We're bringing these measures forward to March next year, saving the average family with two children in care around $700 this financial year and $2,200 a year going forward. The Morrison government is committed to increasing economic opportunities for Australian women and families, and this additional childcare support will help remove disincentives for primary carers, particularly mothers, to participate in the workforce. This is especially important as our economy begins to open up, providing women with more choices and more chances to enter or re-enter the workforce.</span>

We're also scrapping the $10,655 annual childcare subsidy cap, effective from this year. And this will be applied retrospectively for the whole of the 2021-22 financial year, meaning anyone who reaches the cap before this date will have additional out-of-pocket costs for the 2021-22 financial year reimbursed. It's estimated that around 82,000 families in just Senator Hughes's home state of New South Wales will benefit from this measure. Bringing forward the subsidy and removing that cap will have an incredibly positive impact on families right across the nation.</span>

In fact, around 60 per cent of all subsidies paid go to families on less than $150,000. More than 70 per cent of families pay less than $5 an hour. Almost a quarter pay less than $2 an hour. There are around 280,000 more children in child care now than there were when we came to office, with women's workforce participation reaching record highs of 61.9 per cent in March this year, and that remains near record highs. Let's compare this to Labor's reckless childcare scheme, which would benefit millionaires the most. In fact, under Labor's policy around $1.1 billion per year would go to those earning over $250,000. A couple earning half a million dollars a year would get a $50,000 taxpayer subsidised payment—outrageous largesse. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I've written a couple of pieces which outline my views on this matter, going back several months. I am not an MP who has come to this place ever denying the science of climate change. But nor am I a member of parliament who has ever signed up to policies that will decimate jobs in rural and regional Australia. Over the time I've been in this place, there have been a number of debates in this place, and my political party has stood up for rural and regional Australians and for jobs in our communities. We will continue to do that. I've made it very clear in my personal public commentary that I will not be signing up to any policy that is not right for rural and regional Australia—not just to get us through the next election, but to get us through the next three decades. It is very easy for those who don't live in the communities that we live in and represent the communities that we represent to take a different approach. It's very similar to Senator Canavan, who lives in a community that is based around coalmining. But, when you look at Anthony Albanese's perspective on coalmining—he lives nowhere near it: 'I don't think there's a place for new coal-fired power plants in Australia, full stop.' </span>

I support the Prime Minister pursuing a technology-not-taxes approach to lowering our emissions in this country. As a species, the human species, over eons, has progressed through the adoption of technologies. The National Party in the Senate has been very, very clear: when it came to clean energy financing, we moved amendments and tabled amendments that backed the low emissions technologies of carbon capture and storage. I really wish we could get Larissa Waters and her team onto how we actually can protect jobs while simultaneously lowering emissions, and that is through those types of technologies.</span>

The COVID-19 situation in Papua New Guinea is very concerning. We're seeing a new surge in cases associated with the delta strain and it is placing significant pressure on the health system. Both the Prime Minister and I have spoken with our Papua New Guinea colleagues to discuss the challenges they're dealing with, including to assure them that Australia is standing by them at this very difficult time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the start of the pandemic, we've been partnering closely with the government of Papua New Guinea on their needs. That includes over two million pieces of PPE; testing equipment and supplies; oxygen concentrators and pressurised air masks; over 100,000 genomic tests, with support from Melbourne's Doherty institute, to identify COVID-19 variants of concern; and support to enable increased provincial health service delivery through church health services. We have now deployed five Australian medical assistance teams, or AUSMATs, to Papua New Guinea to provide critical care planning and clinical care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're now providing further assistance as Papua New Guinea responds to this most recent, and concerning, surge in cases. That includes partnering on the reopening of the Nightingale Centre to increase the capacity of Port Moresby General Hospital, and support to provincial health authorities to maintain essential operations. We're supporting Papua New Guinea to vaccinate more frontline health workers, and expanding commercial vaccination hubs, including in major urban centres such as Lae. The Australian Defence Force is providing logistics support and vaccination training to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force—and I acknowledge the exceptional working relationship between the PNGDF and the ADF. Australia will continue to meet Papua New Guinea's vaccine supply needs and support its vaccination rollout program in partnership with the Papua New Guinean government.</span>

It is indeed exceptional work that those teams are doing. A seven-person AUSMAT arrived in Port Moresby last Saturday on a flight that also delivered the oxygen concentrators that I referred to earlier. It's led by one of their most experienced doctors, Dr Mark Little. The team includes a nurse practitioner, a public health specialist and logistics experts. I acknowledge and thank Dr Little and the AUSMATs who have deployed to Papua New Guinea and the Pacific through the COVID-19 pandemic. The team has strong experience partnering with Papua New Guinea's health officials. They will be in PNG for three weeks, working closely with the ministry of health and the important National Control Centre. The team will identify further priorities for assistance, including additional clinical support to manage the surge and medical equipment that can be deployed within the Papua New Guinea health system.</span>

Last night Australia delivered a further 60,000 vaccine doses to Papua New Guinea. We're committed to working with them to meet the needs of the country. We're partnering with the government, with business and with NGOs to promote the importance of vaccinations and we've launched a campaign with the Papua New Guinea Council of Churches to address hesitancy issues. The ADF is providing logistics support in the Torres Strait border region, where vaccination rates are the highest in Papua New Guinea. An Australian-funded clinic in Port Moresby administered over 13 per cent of the vaccinations nationally. We're supporting pop-up clinics at convenient locations such as shopping centres. Australian experts are working with PNG and the WHO on a plan to expand and accelerate the rollout, prioritising those provinces with the highest numbers of cases.</span>

The climate impacts of your coal, oil and gas loving government are being felt first and foremost by nations who did nothing to create this crisis, including our Pacific neighbours, who are watching their children's future disappear under water. Yet, Australia has abjectly failed to deliver its share of climate finance, as committed to in the Copenhagen Accord.</span>

The short answer to the question is that Australia has made a strong commitment to climate finance, including in the Pacific. That includes, between 2020 and 2025, $1.5 billion, with at least $500 million of that going to the Pacific. That's to directly answer your question. There are a number of other pejoratives in your question, some of which I'll seek to address. When it comes to the issue of climate finance, we will have more to say going forward. But when it comes to doing our bit, we absolutely reject the Greens' constant incorrect, inadequate assertions that we are somehow not doing our bit when it comes to climate change. We hear from the Greens constantly. They parrot it. They talk our country down, and they ignore the facts. When I'm speaking with Pacific leaders, we deal with the facts rather than the assertions that are made by the Greens. Those facts include that we have reduced our emissions by 20 per cent since 2005. When we compare that to other similar economies around the world, we are doing far more than our bit. When you look at countries like Canada, we are well ahead; when you look at the OECD average of wealthy nations, we are well ahead. We have reduced our emissions at a faster rate than places like the US and Japan and the OECD average.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens might want to put forward this assertion, which is completely not based in fact—which is, in fact, incorrect—you might want to talk our country down when it comes to these actions, but whether we're talking to our Pacific neighbours or whether we are going on to the world stage more broadly, we have a proud record. We will do our bit and continue to do our bit and work with countries in the region and beyond to deal with these challenging issues.</span>

But when it comes to the history and when it comes to contributing to climate finance, we have made our intentions clear, and we have done it in all sorts of ways, as I outlined in answer to your first question. Going forward, we have committed $1.5 billion to climate finance around the world, with at least $500 million of that to go to the Pacific. As I said earlier, we intend to make further announcements in that space. But I go to the point that Australia is doing its bit and will continue to do its bit. We do it in a way that protects our economy; we do it in a way that works with our partners in the region. We take our responsibilities to our Pacific family very seriously. We're not going to be lectured to by the Greens on how we should do that, but we have a proud record despite your attempts to talk it down.</span>

We certainly won't be taking our leave from the Greens when it comes to our response to climate change—and on very few other issues, it must be said. Now, the Labor Party might take their lead from the Greens when it comes to responding to climate change. They may well—and we've seen that in the past. The big danger for this country is, if they were in government again, that they'd take their lead from you. We got an insight into that from Senator Gallagher just this week, when she left open the possibility of bringing back a carbon tax if the Labor Party come back in.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we know that if there's a Labor-Greens government in the future, the Greens will be pushing for a carbon tax, the shadow finance minister says all options are on the table, including the carbon tax. So, we won't be following your advice when it comes to responding to climate change. We won't be following the Labor Party's advice. The Australian people need to understand if there was a change of government, it would be the Greens dictating to the Labor Party, who say they are open to bringing a carbon tax back. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I acknowledge particularly the efforts that the government of Fiji has made to reach such high vaccination levels amongst its population. I acknowledge the work that Papua New Guinea is doing, and has been doing for a very long time in extremely difficult circumstances, across perhaps the most complex geography you can possibly imagine, to try to address the challenges of COVID-19.</span>

I don't think we should underestimate those. That's why we're working with churches, non-government organisations and the government itself in many of those places.

And I'm not sure it would come from the remarks of Senator Fierravanti-Wells in this case, given what you have explained to me. I think you're reflecting unfairly on Senator Fierravanti-Wells, and I think that's most unfortunate, Senator Wong—that you would reflect unfairly on Senator Fierravanti-Wells. What is important here, Senator Wong, is the work that we are doing with the government of Papua New Guinea, a sovereign nation with whom we are honoured to work and with whom we work very hard to address the sorts of challenges that other senators have raised sensibly and constructively in the chamber.</span>

Thank you very much, Senator Smith, for the question, and thank you also for your passion for and commitment to the people of the Kimberley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since becoming Minister for the NDIS six months ago, I've been listening and consulting widely on all aspects of the scheme. Recently I spent a week travelling across the Kimberley region to hear and see firsthand the impact of thin markets on how the NDIS is able to support people with disability in regional and remote communities. This included many meetings, such as the ones with staff, volunteers and organisers at the Yura Yungi Aboriginal Medical Service in Halls Creek, the women's resource centre in Fitzroy Crossing, the Lions Outback Vision institute in Broome and the East Kimberley All Abilities Sports and Recreation program in Kununurra. I thank them all for their hospitality, their time and their openness. This allowed me to hear and see firsthand how the NDIS is transforming lives. However, it also allowed me to see firsthand the challenges in providing care and support in remote and regional communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The negative impact on thin markets is very clear. The workforce shortages further exacerbate service availability. Average plan budgets in the Kimberley are actually around $10,000 higher than the national average, while utilisation is 20 per cent lower, at 51 per cent. Quite clearly, this needs to change nationally. I hope to bring forward legislation this year to start addressing these problems of thin markets by providing the NDIA with more flexible commissioning models. The level and the quality of support received by any Australian on the NDIS should never ever be determined by where they live, but today, sadly, with thin markets, that is still the case.</span>

The NDIS fourth-quarter report shows that planned utilisation in the Kimberley region is 20 per cent lower than the national average, which, sadly, is not uncommon in remote communities in particular across Australia. That is the case not just for disability services but for the provision of all care and support services in remote communities. </span>

But, sadly, one is where my heart literally broke—meeting a quadriplegic participant in her 40s in a remote aged-care facility. She knows exactly how she wants to live her life: with her children. But, sadly, living so remotely, the life she wants to live is not yet possible. She has nowhere else to live to stay near community or get the supports that she needs so badly and that she's actually funded for in her NDIS packages. The upcoming changes to legislation will help us all address this. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

To tackle the endemic issue of thin markets, we have to enable providers to operate effectively nationwide, no matter where they are delivering services. To do this, we have to build local workforces across regional and remote Australia for all types of care and support services, and this is a responsibility shared between the federal government and the state government. I'm delighted to be working with Pat Turner and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation to develop a model to deliver in new and different ways a wide range of care and support services in remote communities, including for NDIS participants. Together we are developing a regional community based workforce model informed by the needs of locals to provide long-term employment opportunities and better support for people living in remote communities and also remote towns.</span>

As I informed the Senate earlier this week, there have been an unprecedented number of questions posed through the life of this parliament—both questions on notice provided through the chamber and questions on notice through estimates committees. In fact, if my recollection is correct, those coming through the chamber are close to being in excess of the total number handled in the two previous parliaments combined, showing the many thousands of questions that have been presented. Overwhelmingly, those questions are answered in as timely a manner as possible. We will look into the particulars in relation to the questions that Senator Keneally has highlighted, and no doubt efforts will be made to provide responses to those in as timely a way as possible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, what will happen first in Australian politics? Will the Prime Minister hop into his Comcar and head down to the Governor-General's to call an election, or will he and his ministers finally answer the questions put to them here in the 46th Parliament? It's disturbing how easily those opposite ignore their duties as public servants in this place. 'Accountability', 'transparency' and 'responsibility' are all nouns without a home in the Morrison-Joyce vernacular. 'I don't hold a hose, mate,' said the Prime Minister. Well, apparently he doesn't hold any answers either. He doesn't appear to do much of anything. We know that the Prime Minister failed on the two jobs he had this year: roll out the vaccine and set up fit-for-purpose quarantine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I have picked five questions that have been ignored by this Morrison-Joyce government, but there are hundreds. There are over 500 questions unanswered, dating back to March 2020. There are pre-pandemic questions for which no answers are yet provided. Those unanswered questions from March 2020 were asked of the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Morrison. The Prime Minister won't answer them. If that's the example he's setting, no wonder the Morrison-Joyce government acts the way that it does. A fish does rot from the head down, after all, and this rotten behaviour undermines the community's faith in our democratic institutions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some in our community who might think this is all business as usual, but an increasing number of Australians are growing disillusioned with the way Mr Morrison plays politics in this country. They see the bad behaviour of the Morrison-Joyce government go unpunished and think that it represents the parliament at large. My message to those people is this: This is not normal. This is not the status quo. This is how bad government operates. The Morrison-Joyce government have plumbed new depths in every aspect of accountability and transparency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare this government to its most recent predecessors. I personally never thought we would pine for the days of Prime Minister Turnbull, but a comparison between then and now just shows how quickly the standards have deteriorated under Mr Morrison. Dr Parkinson, the former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, put the real value on accountability and transparency. That standard was set from the very top, and it flowed down accordingly. There was an expectation that you would do your job as a minister. They got it wrong—a lot—under the Turnbull government, but at least people were disciplined on occasion. They were disciplined for misconduct; they were disciplined for their lack of accountability. The current Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, does not punish bad behaviour; he rewards it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look no further than the current Minister for Emergency Management and National Recovery and Resilience. This is an unlimited debate, but I still wouldn't have enough time to go through the intricacies of the sports rorts scandal. The sports rorts scandal saw Minister McKenzie forced to resign, but she was quickly brought back by Mr Morrison, and now she is deciding Australia's climate change policy. She is one of the gang of four that's going to decide how many millions, or perhaps billions, of dollars of pork are going to flow through to allow Mr Morrison to secure a deal on climate change. Maybe he will; maybe he won't. Today we saw the minister openly threatening her cabinet colleagues—quite an extraordinary performance in question time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Minister McKenzie is only one of the many scandal-prone ministers who've made startling comebacks under Mr Morrison: Ministers Taylor, Joyce, Colbeck, Cash, Ley, Dutton, Fletcher, Robert, Tudge, Hunt, Ruston, Reynolds and Porter. If you want to work out what they did, go to our website notonyourside.org.au. If you're a backbencher in the Morrison government, if you are stuck looking at the back of someone's head in question time, you have got to be asking yourself, 'What have I done right to be stuck up the back here?' It's truly staggering what gets rewarded on Mr Morrison's watch. Ministerial standards are dead under Mr Morrison. We will see that again, I predict, when, after the cabinet adopts net zero by 2050, Minister McKenzie and Minister Pitt don't have to abide by the ministerial guidelines. Let's see if they get a free pass. Comparing the days of old with the current standard is truly an exercise in despair, a stark contrast between a bygone era when ministerial standards and government accountability existed and the utter mess that we are in today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister doesn't like answering questions, because he knows the Australian people won't like the answers. This Prime Minister governs by focus group. How do we know that? Because one of his own colleagues told the media, 'At the heart of the Morrison government is a focus group.' His own colleagues, including Senator Fierravanti-Wells, call the Prime Minister's office the 'prime marketing office'. So the hundreds of unanswered questions on notice are a massive red flag to the Australian people. Let's be clear: if the answers were good news for the government, they'd be shouting them from the rooftop. The Prime Minister can't build a chicken coop without a ribbon-cutting ceremony and a social media post. That is because he is all photo-op and no follow-up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's very little substance to what goes on in the Morrison government. There's no big, grand plan. There's no ambition for the Australian people. The Morrison government—Mr Morrison and his ministers—are not interested in Australians' jobs; they're only interested in their own jobs. Mr Morrison doesn't care about anything except his own political agenda, and he is certainly not on the side of the Australian people. If Mr Morrison were, he would be upfront with the Australian people. He would answer the questions put to him in this parliament. He would hold ministers to account for their actions and behaviours. He'd be proud of his work, rather than hiding the answers in the shadows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have a right to know, in a democracy, what decisions are being made in their name and how their taxpayer dollars are being spent. The problem for Mr Morrison is that, on the rare occasions he and his ministers do answer questions, the Australian people don't seem to like their answers, so they know that being truthful to the Australian people will jeopardise their own job security. There's an election right around the corner. Do we seriously think these 500 questions on notice that haven't been answered are somehow 500 good-news stories kicking around the ministerial wing that they're going to roll out in the advent of an election? Of course not. That's absurd. These are questions they don't want to answer before an election because they don't want the truth to come out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Australian people have a right to know how their government's being run. Scrutiny of the Morrison-Joyce government is essential. It's essential for our democracy. It's essential for restoring the public's faith in democratic institutions, because on this government's watch we have had sports rorts, robodebt, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, safer seats rorts, the Leppington triangle, car park rorts, jobs for mates, Paladin, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation grant, Helloworld and the JobKeeper rorts, where they gave $13 billion of taxpayer money to companies that turned a profit during the pandemic and they're not lifting a finger to try to get any of that money back. Under robodebt we saw the pursuit of the penniless, in some cases to their deaths, but the government don't lift a finger against their corporate mates. They don't even suggest they might want to pay the money back—$13 billion, wasted. A trillion dollars of debt has been run up, with so little to show for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we see last week? The Building Better Regions Fund rorts. What a joke! The money overwhelmingly went—90 per cent, I think it was—to government-held or marginal seats.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator KENEALLY:</span>
                  </a>  Of course, let's not forget, as Senator Green points out, that some of it went to areas that could only in the wildest of imaginations be considered regions. I think my personal favourite in New South Wales was the regional funding that went to refurbish the North Sydney Olympic Pool. Right there under the Harbour Bridge, next door to Luna Park and directly opposite the Opera House, a regional fund was used to build a swimming pool. I don't know. Maybe they think people from the regions in New South Wales like to travel all the way into North Sydney to have a swim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, we know about billions and billions and billions of dollars of rorting, scandal, waste and mismanagement under this government's watch. Every time they appear before Senate estimates, what do we get? Another colour coded spreadsheet. What did we hear last week? Anne Webster, the member for Mallee in the other place, basically belled the cat. She inadvertently let it out of the bag. There was a green spreadsheet and a pink spreadsheet, but only government members got told about the green and pink spreadsheets. If you wanted your project to move from the pink to the green, you had to lobby some government minister really hard. Well, no wonder about 90 per cent of the funding went to government or marginal seats—because they were run in a colour coded spreadsheet scheme! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Morrison government ministers and the Prime Minister himself are not answering questions put to them through the finance committee. I can't imagine how bad this is all going to look when the ANAO inevitably reports on all the dodgy pork-barrelling that's going to happen to get to a deal on net zero emissions by 2050. What was it one of the government members called it—a giant green rainbow that's going to spread across the regions with crocks of pork sprinkled about? We've got a minister here in the chamber, the Minister for Finance, who won't even tell us how much money they're prepared to spend for this political fix, who won't even tell us if it's in the budget. That trillion dollars of debt—nothing to show for it going up and up; just a political outcome. But this is an inevitable outcome when you have a prime minister who views every act of governance as a marketing opportunity. There's nothing that can't be solved with a catchy slogan, no storm that can't be weathered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what we saw in the chamber here today: the Morrison-Joyce government sought to politicise domestic violence victims. I strike a deal with the minister, Alex Hawke. After two years—two years I've been trying to get a meeting with the minister for immigration—finally, I get one. Finally we get a deal, an agreement. We're going to deliver this piece of legislation. We're going to fix some things for women and children who are suffering domestic violence. We're going to deal with the problem of low-level offending. We're going to try to address the concerns raised by New Zealand. We strike a deal. We're going to come to a conclusion in two weeks time. What happens? Mr Morrison pulls the rug out from underneath his own minister, because what would he rather have? A political outcome, not a practical solution—and what a low act. Women and children who are victims of domestic violence: is there anything this Prime Minister won't politicise? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison-Joyce government does not, as the Prime Minister once said, 'burn for' Australia; they simmer in self-interest. The Australian people are waking up to the Prime Minister's schtick, his adman approach and his prime-marketing office. And there's something to see here with these unanswered questions. There must be, because they wouldn't be so intent on hiding the answers if there wasn't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being the Prime Minister of Australia actually requires leadership. It means making the tough decisions and being held to account. It means bringing people with you and holding them to a standard. So the malaise that's swept through the cabinet is a choice made by this Prime Minister because it's the easy way out, and it's the Australian people who are worse off as a result. This Prime Minister won't hold himself or his ministers accountable. I hope the ministers and secretaries listening today do take notice and take time to prepare thoroughly for Senate estimates next week. We can't expect questions to be answered when they're taken on notice, so we're hoping for a lot more cooperation in the room next week.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I rise to also take note of the minister's answer to Senator Keneally. There's a great difficulty taking place in the chamber. We are asking questions, as we do as part of our oversight role. It's an important role of the Senate—to ask questions, to inform itself as to the conduct of government such that we can do our job properly, we can discharge our responsibilities properly, in the oversight of government. Yes, questions are asked, and there's a time requirement placed in the standing orders—or, in the case of estimates, time requirements placed by the committees themselves—for the return of those answers, and it is disrespectful for ministers not to supply those answers within the recognised time frames. It's disrespectful not just to the senators who ask those questions but to the people whom those senators represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask many questions on the basis of an email I receive in my electoral office from a constituent that just wants to know something. I'll happily put a question on notice if a South Australian asks me a question and I don't know the answer. It's an important process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we could stop questions on notice if indeed the government found some other source of money to pay for the things that it does, but, you know what? It gets its money from taxpayers. It gets its money from the citizens of Australia, from the businesses of Australia. And, until such time as you find some alternative source, I'm sure senators will continue to ask questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Birmingham stated on Monday and again today that the number of questions that are being asked and answered in this parliament are significantly more than in the last two parliaments. In fact, I think he said that the number of questions answered this parliament equals the same as the last two parliaments combined. Let me just talk about that. There is a fundamental difference between a response to a question and an answer to a question. I can give one example in relation to the cost of some proceedings that concluded over a year ago, and I've had to ask three times—three times for an answer! So, maybe, that explains the reason why there are more questions to this government, because they simply don't answer the question; they respond to it. That means I have to go back and now ask a second question, and sometimes I have to ask it again. So please, Minister, do not stand up in this chamber and suggest that there's something untoward going on here, on this side, in terms of how many questions we're answering, because, on your side, you're simply not answering the questions properly. You're responding, but you are not answering. When you start lifting your game, maybe these problems will disappear for you. Maybe, Minister, you can go back to the party room, to the cabinet, and suggest to them that they take the obligation of properly answering questions seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at a Senate inquiry last Friday in relation to submarines, and I asked Admiral Mead, the head of the task force that informed the government before it made its announcement on 16 September to go down a different pathway to where they were going before, a simple question about the advice that had been given to government about simple things like cost and schedule. One would think, if you're cancelling one program and moving to another program, that, in actual fact, you would only do so if you had at least some fundamental advice as to the cost and as to the schedule. I would ask the question about advice that was given to government, and the answer I got was an answer to a different question. I had to ask it several times. Not only did I have to ask it several times, I then had to remind the Admiral that he wears a naval uniform and he serves the Australian public and not political masters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The culture that we're seeing when we carry out estimates is getting worse. We're getting officials turning up refusing to answer questions, pretending they're answering when they're only responding. We have to go again and again and again to get the answer. I know that the select committee on COVID has sought answers in relation to national cabinet information, and, despite a ruling by Justice White that national cabinet is not a committee of the federal cabinet, the committee is still not getting answers back. That's disgraceful. That's a judicial officer that's made a ruling that's being ignored by the government. The Senate needs to observe what's happening here: answers coming back that aren't answers—they're responses—and going to estimates and not getting proper answers from officials. All of that is led from a culture at the top which is about secrecy. We can see that in the COAG amendment legislation where the Prime Minister, having lost the battle between me and him in the AAT, is now seeking to introduce a new secrecy law—obsessed with secrecy. Just answer the questions. Just be open and honest. In actual fact, I pressed the admiral. I actually had to say to him, 'You are running very close to being in contempt of the Senate,' before he finally answered. The answer he gave me was quite reasonable, but why do we have this culture in there of, 'Let's not answer questions'? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got two matters before the Privileges Committee now, the first being the government's refusal to provide documents to the economics committee, which relates to naval shipbuilding—to one of the biggest government expenditures ever. The documents that were requested were not confidential. They're not secret. They're not top secret. They were simply documents provided to the government in order to help make a decision about which shipbuilder was going to get the job. These are documents that go to what these shipbuilders promised Australian industry. The government has refused to provide those documents to the committee. It's gone off to privileges, and there is some progress being made in relation to that. But how did we get to this point? How did we get to this point where—even with documents being given to a committee, who are willing to accept them in camera, such that they are protected by criminal sanction in the event of a leak—the executive says, 'We're not going to provide those documents to the Senate'?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have a statutory official who receives a lawful order from the Senate. The Senate makes an order for production. The Senate's always very reasonable in the way it conducts its business, much like a court who might issue a subpoena. The person subject to the subpoena or the order is given the opportunity to step forward and say, 'I don't think I should respond to the subpoena or the order for production for these reasons.' What happens, in the case of an OPD, is that the Senate considers that response and makes its final decision. That's exactly what happened in relation to the tax commissioner: the Senate made a decision that the balance of the public interest lied in disclosure. It disagreed with where the balance lied in terms of public interest, and made a lawful order. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To anyone who thinks that I'm making this stuff up, go and read the 1998 High Court case of Egan v Willis. I know Senator Keneally knows that, because it relates to Mr Egan in the New South Wales parliament. The High Court affirmed what was always known through section 49 of the Constitution: that houses of parliament have the ability to acquire or require the production of documents from the executive in order for it to be able to discharge its functions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're now in a situation where we have a couple of matters on foot with the Privileges Committee. I'm hopeful that this is a Senate mojo moment. I look at how the US Senate conducts its inquiries, and I see officials that turn up to the US Senate. They dare not not answer a question. They dare not not provide a document which the US Senate orders, because they know that the US Senate will act. In some senses, there's a test running in the background right now for the Australian Senate. We can push ourselves back into a position where we are treated with the absolute respect that the US Senate is treated with in the US, or we can fail to deal with what I say—as a question of fact—is a contempt: the delay of the naval shipbuilding committee's proceedings for well over a year. That can't go unaddressed. I hope the Privileges Committee finds that to be a contempt and issues a fine or applies a sanction. We have to change the culture. Whilst I assert that there is a culture of secrecy in the Morrison government, driven from the very, very top, in some senses the Senate, when it seeks answers and doesn't get them, basically lets the executive get away with it and becomes part of the problem. I’m hopeful that we will see a change and see some Senate mojo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer back to a situation with Facebook a couple of years ago when the UK House of Commons wanted access to documents from Mr Zuckerberg. He refused. Of course, he's outside their jurisdiction. Someone turned up to the UK and the House of Commons said, 'We've got someone who's got the documents,' and they sent out the Serjeant at Arms, met up with the gentleman, invited him to come back in a very insistent way to the House of Commons and offered him two choices: 'Hand over the documents or you can sit in the jail for a while.' The UK House of Commons got those documents because it stood up. It exercised its powers. You don't have to do it many times. It is a little bit like freedom-of-navigation exercises. Every once in a while you have to sail a ship through international waters despite a country saying that they think it's their waters in order to be able to assert a right and to remind people of your rights. I hope the Senate stands up in these two instances, with these two privileges matters, to send a very strong message to the executive that they must respect our need to be well informed in what it is that we do and our need to be able to get access to documents when we ask for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing today on the issue raised by Senator Keneally is in fact part of a much broader problem. I'd ask the minister to consider all of the things that I've said in relation to that today and understand the responsibilities of answering questions on time. It is really important and, again, it's disrespectful when you don't do that. I'll foreshadow to the minister that tomorrow I will also use the same standing orders in relation to the four answers to estimates questions I asked that haven't been returned. So consider that notice under the guidelines in respect of the standing order. Hopefully by tomorrow I will have all those answers; otherwise we will be back here having another conversation about the responsibilities of the government and the need for them to be able to respond to the Senate in a timely fashion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  I thank Senator Gallagher for her question. As I indicated in response to Senator Keneally and have already indicated this week and on previous occasions, the government has been dealing with quite unprecedented numbers of questions posed through the parliament and, in doing so, the government has been providing quite unprecedented numbers of answers to questions posed through the parliament. We're not talking about hundreds of questions. We're not talking about thousands of questions. We're actually talking about tens of thousands of questions in the life of this parliament. The government work to try to provide answers, when we can, to those questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are some senators who seek to be quite diligent and earnest in the approach that they take most of the time. I acknowledge in Senator Patrick's remarks that he just made that he stuck broadly to the question before the chair around accountability and government responsiveness. He addressed issues in terms of the particular nature of particular answers that are given. So, although I don't accept the premise of all the statements that Senator Patrick made in that regard, I acknowledge he at least stuck to the broad thrust of the debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, if the chamber reflected upon the remarks made by Senator Keneally immediately preceding Senator Patrick, we'd find that it was a much more politicised contribution, reflecting the fact that many times, particularly from those opposite, the questions asked are more about cheap pointscoring, more about trying to advance political agendas, more about trying to seize a cheap headline or the like. It's the right of those senators to spend their time asking those questions, and, again, of the many thousands of such questions that come about, the government responds to them, even where there's a whole swathe of hypocrisy attached to them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Keneally, in her remarks, jumped across many issues beyond the questions that she was asking about. She spent some time talking about grant programs and recent comments in relation to grant programs. I note that among the grant programs that were the subject of such commentary by Senator Keneally and others were the Community Development Grants Program and the Stronger Communities Program. I can't help but notice that so many members of the opposition quite happily take advantage of such programs, promote such programs and advocate for grants under such programs, but then of course, if there's a cheap headline to be had, they're lining up, forming a conga line, to try to go after a cheap headline in the national political debate, while trying to seek out a good headline in their local media or their social media.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition himself had the fabulous social media post 'Grants for Grayndler: could your community organisation use a grant?' And there were not one, not two, not three, not four, not five but half-a-dozen different photos of Mr Albanese posing happily with different grant recipients, just in the one post there. Much of the commentary from Senator Keneally and others in this debate has been about whether too many of these grants have been going to city electorates rather than regional electorates. If I'm correct, the electorate of Grayndler is—</span>

                  </a>  Touche, Senator Patrick. Deputy President, indeed I am responding in a little lengthier way than I did to Senator Keneally's question to me about unanswered questions, because of the way in which Senator Keneally sought to then elaborate more broadly in relation to those matters. I don't wish to take up the time of the Senate at length. I was simply making the point around the highly politicised nature of some questions. In other cases, we have seen, particularly this year, that questions often are in pursuit of sensitive matters, sometimes legally sensitive matters, that do pose extra challenges in responding or answering them. That requires either extra advice being taken by government in response, extra care, or, sometimes, highlighting the fact that such details are difficult to provide without compromising or prejudicing legal proceedings.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I again come back to the substantive point that I made, which is that this government, in this parliament, has responded to more questions than were posed in the previous parliament or were posed in the parliament before that. We have been more responsive than any previous government has been asked to be. We continue to seek to be so. We have been handling literally tens of thousands—something close to 35,000—questions posed through estimates or Senate chamber processes. That doesn't take account of House of Representatives questions. It doesn't take account of Senate select committee, Senate standing committee, House of Representatives standing committee, joint standing committee or joint select committee questions. They're all on top of the 35,000 that we have sought to handle to date. Indeed, we'll continue to do so and provide responses in as timely a manner as possible, but it is in the face of record levels of questioning and, in some cases, highly sensitive approaches too.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I listen to the Minister for Finance, I think the argument about the questions that I have asked for, which are, I think, 166 days overdue now, is essentially that the government has had a lot of questions asked of it—more questions than previous governments. I would submit that some of the explanation for that is that we've never had a government that has been so intent on not answering questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the questions that I've asked that are now 166 days late could have been answered in the estimates committee, but they weren't, because this government's approach to transparency and accountability is to have public servants appear and, if there is anything that it is not in the government's interests to answer, have them take it on notice or find another way not to answer the question. There is a problem with the openness of this government, which now has a consequential effect on the number of questions that are being taken on notice, which now the senator, who is leaving the chamber, has used as an excuse to say, 'We're overworked.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's right that the Senate should not only get a reasonable explanation—other than, 'Sorry, we came to work and we're really busy and we haven't gotten around to it,' which was essentially Senator Birmingham's submission to the Senate—but demand that this information be provided. You are the government. You are responsible, as the guardians of hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds. You are making decisions on the nation's behalf. There are senators in this place elected to hold you to account. You answer those questions. You don't come in here and cry fake tears, saying you're a bit busy and you haven't got around to it. That is a completely useless explanation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister and Cabinet, which answers to these questions would emanate from, is the worst offender in my experience. The Prime Minister's right-hand man, the butler who runs to serve his every need when the bell gets rung by the Prime Minister, leads that department, and that is the standard they set. They take things on notice and then have no intention of answering to the Senate. That forces us to come in here and expose them and embarrass them, and I still don't think it'll matter to Mr Gaetjens or his crew, because that is the leadership that, under this Prime Minister, is shown about accountability, honesty, transparency and responsibility to the parliament and accountability to the parliament, not just to executive government. When PM&amp;C are led like that and behave in this way, why should any other department be any better? It's clear they get rewarded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're heading into estimates next week. Let's see how many senior public servants, who are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, turn up and don't have information available or 'aren't able to take that question right now; we'll get back to you', knowing full well that they can take 100 days or longer because there is no consequence and because they're rewarded by the leadership for doing that. That's my prediction of what will happen, and that's why we're here now, using up precious time in the Senate to make the point that this is unacceptable. That's why you just had those contributions from Senator Keneally and Senator Patrick, and I associate myself with the comments Senator Patrick made as well, because they were spot-on. I think what this government hopes is that this explanation, 'Oh shucks, we got to work and we're a little bit busy,' will keep it at bay until the election. You can see what's going on. But after eight years of this type of approach these institutions, these conventions—the parliamentary practice that has developed over time and enshrined these processes as part of our democracy—are getting chipped away at. It's important that we stand up for them and important that we call it out. Even if Mr Gaetjens isn't going to answer my letter asking him where these answers are, even if they come to estimates next week and refuse to answer, it is important that the Senate stands up, calls it out and tries to protect it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you whittle away the Public Service, as this government has done; when you whittle away the FOI Act, which this government has done and continues to attempt to do; when you disempower the Auditor-General, as this government has done, in punishment and retaliation for the audit reports that it puts out on the government's rorting of grants schemes; and when you start wearing away the integrity processes of the parliament, there will be consequences for our democracy and our access to information. That is what we are standing up for. That is what is happening here. My questions 1356, 501 and 519 to 531, asked at March Estimates 2021 might not seem much, but the fact that this is a systemic approach to dealing with questions on notice is about whittling away those parliamentary practices, the scrutiny role of the Senate, because it suits this government. That's exactly what it's doing. They've done it to the Auditor-General, they're doing it to the FOI Act, they're doing it to the way they deal with OPDs in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all pretty obvious. Maybe, taken on their own, people don't see that it's that big a deal; but put it all together and there has been an eight-year-long assault on the scrutiny and accountability functions of the parliament. That's why we're raising these points today. It's not about an overworked government; it's about a secret government. It's a government that will do anything it can to keep information away from the public eye regardless of the fact that it is paid for with public dollars. If it's not in their political interests, they will withhold access to that information. That's why we're raising these points today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues that are covered by my questions actually relate to a lot of questions around the matters surrounding Ms Brittany Higgins and the role of the Prime Minister's Office. There is a whole range of questions now that it didn't suit the Prime Minister to ask at the time and it doesn't suit him to answer them now. But the option available to the department is to provide an answer—for example, 'We are not in a position to provide this answer because there is a police investigation ongoing.' They could do that, but they don't bother doing that either. It's just a blanket refusal to respond to reasonable questions asked of officials. It suits the government to have this approach, I have no doubt about it. But we must stand up, we must ask for reasonable explanations, and we must demand that officials attend estimates with the answers to these questions; they are 166 days overdue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that, when you guys are on the opposition benches, you will seek to protect these conventions too but that you won’t have to fight so hard because you would be working under a different arrangement with a government that actually understands and respects these practices. So I don't accept Senator Birmingham's explanation in any way that this is just because they've got a lot of questions. They've got a lot of questions because they don't answer the questions when they're required to show up, and they don't provide the information they should provide without having to take it on notice. For example, the Doherty modelling that we spoke of yesterday. Why hasn't that been released? Why do you have to put in an FOI request and questions on without notice and questions on notice about accessing that information? There's a little saving on the count of questions on notice for Senator Birmingham. You could cut them down right now if you actually start releasing the information that you should release in the public interest. You should answer the questions that are being asked. Senators should be treated with respect and be able to fulfil their responsibilities for their roles in this parliament, including holding this government to account. That's what this is about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Mr Gaetjens: I hope I do get a response to the letter that I wrote. I'm looking forward to receiving all those answers to questions on notice that are now 166 days overdue before estimates meet on Monday. There is no reasonable explanation that I will accept about why these questions have not been answered and why they shouldn't be answered on time by close of business tomorrow afternoon, other than you are just wilfully obstructing the work of the Senate. You've had plenty of notice. You were reminded of the obligations in a letter. As per the guidance around this standing order, you were reminded again today that we are interested in the answers to these questions.

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Emergency Management and National Recovery and Resilience (Senator McKenzie) and the Minister for Families and Social Services (Senator Ruston) to questions without notice asked by Senators Keneally and Gallagher and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) today relating to targets for carbon emissions and to Cabinet solidarity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear from the answers to questions from Senator McKenzie today and, indeed, throughout this week that at the heart of this faux negotiation between the Nationals and the Liberals—the will they or won't they—is the very existence of the National Party. There are only two reasons that the National Party actually exist these days. One is for pork-barrelling; the other is for culture wars. Senator McKenzie has brazenly confirmed with her answers in question time today and this week. They're stringing things along in an attempt to extort as much pork as they can out of the Liberal Party. They've even appointed a four-person committee to actually look at how much pork they can get and what they can do with it. That is what the National Party are up to this week. That is why they are stringing things along in this faux negotiation. Exhibit A in this is actually Senator McKenzie herself, the person who lost her job over pork-barrelling and has now been brought back into the ministry. It's only the Nationals that could be capable of doing something. They don't punish someone who's been engaged in pork-barrelling; they actually reward them and get them back in cabinet, and then put them at the heart of what they are up to this week. That says all about the National Party that that is what they are trying to do this week. They're trying to extort as much as they can out of the Libs and then go about pork-barrelling in the lead-up to an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason why the Nationals exist these days is the culture wars. That's all they've got to offer the people of regional Australia—not a vision for the future, not setting out something they want to achieve. All they want to do is engage in the culture war. They never attempt to have a positive vision for regional Australia; it's all about the scare campaign. We can see elements of that. We can see the way that Senator Canavan's behaving. They want to ensure that they've still got that ability. Again, Senator McKenzie let the cat out of the bag. In her answer to a question yesterday, she said, 'The only reason they exist is to try and stop Labor from being in government.' There's no actual positive vision; there's no actual reason for being in government. The only reason they exist is that they want to try to stop Labor from being in government. That is how sad the National Party have become in this place. I spend a lot of time in regional Queensland. I've got a second office in Gladstone. I spend a lot of time in Gladstone, in the seat of Flynn. I do a lot of travel through Central Queensland. And what is so frustrating, why we are so frustrated by this motivation of the National Party, is that there are so many opportunities that are out there in regional Queensland—be it jobs, be it the future—and there are businesses that are actually going about taking those opportunities, but with no help from the federal government. Businesses are actually spending their own money because they see opportunities and they want to do the right thing by the planet in the long term, so they're actually investing their own money in these opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Emerald a couple of months ago with the shadow Treasurer. We visited an Emerald bus company that does a lot of charter work. It does significant amounts of work for the mining industry—taking in workers, taking out workers and doing it safely so that the workers aren't driving tired after a shift. It's spending hundreds of thousands of dollars converting its bus fleet to hydrogen with no help from the government whatsoever. This is a bus company, a business group, that wants to do the right thing by the country. It sees opportunity, it's prepared to spend its hard-earned money transitioning its fleet because it's the right thing to do in Emerald, in the seat of Flynn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw what the state government did with Fortescue Future Industries just a couple of Sundays ago. It was a really exciting announcement in Gladstone about hydrogen. Hundreds of jobs are at stake there. I was in Gladstone a few days after that announcement and I actually got the sense that the people of Gladstone saw this as a real initiative. They know this is going to deliver jobs. They know it's going to have a beneficial impact for their local community. This is what the future looks like—but, again, without any help from the federal government. The state government has had to go it alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The week before that in Gladstone, we saw the joint announcement made by Rio Tinto and the state government, once again, about the future of their refineries in Gladstone. They're looking at clean energy that is actually going to power those refineries into the future. Those refineries use about 20 per cent of Queensland's electricity. They're significant energy users, but it shows you, again, that they're looking at what the future looks like for them and they understand the role that clean energy will play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so frustrating that the Nationals are having this faux war while regional Queensland and other parts of the country are getting on with the job of transitioning the country. If only we had a federal government that was actually prepared to work with them! How much more could we achieve then?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  I thank the Labor Party for raising this very important issue, because, from what I have just heard, what has just been highlighted to this chamber is that our tactics are working. We are on a path to lowering emissions through technology, not taxes. Private enterprise is working with government to achieve a lower emissions future. It is exactly what this side of the chamber has been saying for the last couple of years. Everyone wants to focus on the fact we haven't got a carbon tax and that, therefore, without a carbon tax, we're not addressing net zero, we're not addressing carbon emissions without a carbon tax. Well, what a crock. What an absolute load of rubbish, which has just been proven by Senator Chisholm's contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, through our road map to a lower emissions future, through our technology not taxes policies, private enterprise is getting on with the job, as are our government agencies. Australia has reduced its emissions by 20 per cent since 2005, the majority of which has occurred since we took government in 2013. That is only one per cent less than what has been achieved by the EU. We have done it through technology, not taxes. We have done it by expanding consumer choice, not restricting it. We have done it by partnering with the private sector, not hitting them with a big stick. We have done it by consolidating our advantage. We have done it by seeing Australia adopt rooftop solar panels at a rate higher than anywhere else on the planet. That is because we have not taxed people out of the market. We have not made it impossible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I hear on the ground, even from people who absolutely believe in climate change, who absolutely support moving towards a low-emissions future, is that they are scared for their future. I've heard from farmers who acknowledge climate change, who live with climate change, who've lived through drought and with flood, who deal with the threat of bushfires year in, year out. What they don't want to see is them being locked off their farms for some arbitrary native vegetation target that does not achieve carbon abatement that is as good as its alternatives. But that's what we saw the last time the Labor Party was in power. We saw farmers lose their right to farm. They ignored the potential for soil carbon capture and storage through cropping enterprises. They ignored the potential to reduce methane emissions from livestock by changing dietary requirements. Since we've been in power the CSIRO, working with James Cook University, have developed fantastic seaweed based feedstock for the livestock industry that is achieving huge emissions reductions, phenomenal emissions reductions. These people should be rewarded, not lambasted because they haven't implemented a tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard from miners worried that we're just going to shut the industry overnight, which is also a crock. There are 129 new coal fired power stations currently under construction by countries that have signed up to net zero. Guess whose coal they want. They want ours, because ours burns more cleanly and more efficiently. So I'm not shutting the coal industry, and I won't support any moves that do. I back the mining industry, because that's where we get our lithium from for the batteries that underpin our renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Labor, for highlighting all the progress that we as a nation have made. I wish we would all get behind the achievements that both private enterprise and government agencies have made to get us to 20 per cent reductions, to get us on the pathway to Paris.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  This week has been an interesting one to say the least. On one hand we have had the coalition, in particular members of the National Party, say that they have a plan to reduce emissions, but on the other hand they still want to support some of the biggest polluters in this country. It is a reasonable statement to make that we as parliamentarians are by no means strangers to conflict, particularly in this place here in the Senate, but today in question time there was a prominent illustration of this, where our passion and our disagreements with each other on what is best for our nation's future were on full display for all to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been here for only two years, but from my time previously in another capacity, it is very uncommon for us to see publicly such great levels between members of the government itself—division between the opposition and the government, sure; but public division between ministers and backbenchers and between the Prime Minister and his own Deputy Prime Minister? That is not a common occurrence. Yet that is what has been on show to the Australian public right in the middle of a global pandemic, right in the middle of our economy's start to recovery. In fact, division between the two coalition parties has been on display for quite some time now. Those sitting on the opposite side of the chamber from them have been fortunate to have front-row seats, so to speak, to the great climate stoush between the Liberals and the Nationals, to see firsthand and live in colour the continued fraying of the already delicate coalition agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a debacle it has been. The quiet little meetings becoming public press conferences in the hallway, the private sledging spilling out onto our television screens—one could be forgiven for thinking that this stoush was some kind of valiant defence by the junior coalition partner of a policy position that was at the heart of the concerns of their own constituency. Regrettably, it is not. What it is, in reality, is the resistance of a few against not just the tide of history but the wishes of their own supporters. Whilst those Nationals opposite would wish to have you believe that they are standing up for the battling farmer in refusing to come to the table on climate policy, in reality this is not what is happening on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is happening here is the Nationals are again proving themselves to be an island on this issue—cast adrift, all on their own, with barely a stakeholder to keep them company. Take, for instance, the National Farmers Federation, who themselves have already committed to a net carbon zero by 2050. Take, for instance, the grain growers, who themselves have endorsed the National Farmers Federation's own plans and are committed to developing a grain specific target for 2030—not 2050, but 2030. Take, for instance, the red meat industry, which I love and support wholeheartedly, who, themselves, have set a target of carbon neutrality by 2030. So exactly who is it the Nationals are purporting to stand up for, and what exactly is the cost of their resistance? I know that there are many farmers, who I have met, who are lamenting the fact that those opposite are failing to take the issue seriously, failing to accept the challenge and invest in their future prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are disproportionately effected by climate change. They will gain directly from reducing emissions and they will be better off through increases in productivity, whatever the global effort does to limit further warming. So, where is the plan from the Nationals? Australia's farmers want more climate action. They want to be part of the solution. It is no wonder why regional Australians are wary of the Nationals. Refusing to provide our agricultural producers and the regions with the tools they need to prosper in the years to come is not a plan. They are failing in their own leadership. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">red)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I am relieved to hear Senator Ciccone express his support for the red meat industry, and I look forward to not only having a steak with him soon but also perhaps enjoying some of that Grains Council barley used to produce some pretty cracking beers. But I do welcome the end, hopefully, of the ALP targeting the cattle industry with their ridiculous notions around methane emissions from cows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government absolutely understands that Australians are looking to reduce emissions into the future. They're looking for a future that is clean air and clean water and a great environment for their children, their children's children and even their children's children's grandchildren. However, we do understand the pressures that everyday Australians and their families face, and we stand here looking to technology, not taxes. The reason we want to look to technology is that we will never support the imposition of a carbon tax on family. We will not support the imposition of an ETS—or whichever acronym, you guys, on the other side want to dress it up as. Heaven forbid the government benches are ever graced by those opposite again, because we know the first thing we will see is an effort to tax those everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do also understand on this side of the chamber is that net zero by 2050 does not mean zero emissions. I know the far end of this chamber have a little bit of an inability to decipher that fact, but we know that families rely on energy to keep their homes and their businesses running and the certainty that, when they need the power, they can turn it on, but this security is not achieved through taxing them and by pandering to some left-wing anti coal and gas agenda. What's also important to note, as Australians, is that 40 per cent of our emissions are actually the result of our export products. They're actually the result of how this country engages with the world and, in fact, the only two countries that have similar economies to us in this matter are New Zealand and Canada. When it comes to reducing emissions, we are streets ahead of both of those countries. We have done this through adopting a suite of technology products and continuing to support the markets and businesses to invest in this technology to drive emissions lower, without imposing additional tax burdens on families, small businesses and everyday Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that this government is incredibly enthusiastic about is seeing the hydrogen sector grow. We've only recently opened up a new round of grants for seven potential hydrogen hubs, one of them in the Hunter region, an area that I get to spend a great deal of time in, and I am absolutely thrilled to see that a bus company from the Central Coast Hunter region is already looking to move its fleet of buses to hydrogen. We are going to see more and more hydrogen as part of the heavy vehicle, energy and transport mix. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the privilege and the absolute pleasure to work with Energy Renaissance and turn the sod on the first ever lithium-ion battery storage factory being developed in Australia. For those who don't understand the importance of this, what this means is that when we start to develop lithium-ion battery storage we will actually be in a position to capture energy. One in four households currently have solar panels, as Australia has led the way in solar panel uptake. By bringing lithium-ion battery storage into the mix, particularly at the household level, you can then harness that energy; you can hold that energy that's created at two o'clock in the afternoon when the sun's at its highest and use it when you're watching Netflix at 9.30 that night. By using storage facilities and with that storage becoming cheaper and more portable, we will see household emissions reduce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do understand that heavy industry, like aluminium smelters, require affordable, reliable baseload power. That's why those opposite saw the resignation of the fantastic member for Hunter—who I am going to miss—Joel Fitzgibbon. Joel knew the importance that coal was going to have in this energy mix for a substantial period of time to come. Coal is not going anywhere soon. I know it upsets these guys—they are very upset about it—but coal will be with us for a while. Do you know why we need it as well? It's not only for our heavy industries. It's actually racist to want to take it away. Our coal helps developing nations move their countries forward.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Who is in charge of your climate plan this week in Canberra? Who is in charge of the government's climate policy? At the start of this week, everyone thought that it was the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, actually leading the government's plan on net zero—to the complete horror, or course, of most Australians. But now what we hear from the government is that Mr Morrison is back. He's back in charge. But the question is: is he really back in charge? He's clearly not so much back in charge that he feels confident that he can take his plan for net zero emissions to his joint party room for sign off. He is not back in charge quite enough to even dream of legislating net zero emissions, because he cannot count on the members of his own government to vote for that plan. The Prime Minister is not in charge enough to keep the Nationals in his coalition government remotely in line. He's not in charge enough to stop his own Deputy Prime Minister from issuing threats: threats of 'a very hard time' for the government ahead. He is not in charge enough to stop the Nationals from issuing threats that things will 'get ugly', threats that were doubled down on by the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate today, when Senator McKenzie repeated these claims that things are going to get ugly in the government on climate change policy. The Prime Minister is not in charge enough to stop the threats to undermine harmonious government. He's not in charge enough to stop the threats to undermine cabinet solidarity coming from the members of his own team. He's not in charge enough to stop the threats of members of his own government to resign from that government. And the Prime Minister is not in charge enough of his resources minister, Mr Pitt, who still refuses to say that human induced climate change is actually real and actually happening. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this today, this complete mess, Senator Ruston describes as a respectful discussion. You would hate to see what a backroom brawl looks like for this coalition government if this is a respectful discussion. Perhaps the government should be more supportive of the Respectful Relationships program in our schools, and perhaps some of the members of the government should go back to school and take a few units of that course if they want to learn how to have respectful discussions. But apparently this is how it's done in the Morrison government today. This is how they deal with the biggest challenges that we'll face in our time. At 10 minutes to midnight, literally days away from Glasgow—days away from one of the biggest decisions this country will ever make—the people of Australia don't even know who is in charge of our climate action plan, just days away from COP26. The people of Australia don't know who is in charge of their jobs, of jobs for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the people of Australia do know is that their government are in complete meltdown at one of the most critical times in our country's history. They are a complete shambles, a complete stinking mess. They are a hot, steaming mess right now on one of the most important issues that our country faces. And all of that after eight years—eight years for a stinking mess at 10 minutes to midnight. That is the best that the Morrison government have. That is what they have to offer on one of the biggest challenges that we all face. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as we all know, and as Australians know, it's always too little, too late with Mr Morrison. It is Australia's workers who are paying the price, because there is a global race on right now to seize the opportunity that climate action provides us. But we know how the Prime Minister feels about races: he doesn't like to get into them too quickly. This is just another race that the Prime Minister is losing for our country, with absolutely catastrophic consequences. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is a complete stinking mess when it comes to action on climate, and a complete steaming mess when it comes to the jobs of the future that we should be embracing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is cooking, and the Morrison government is sitting on its hands: no targets, no plan and no action. While nature may not have intended to discriminate, geopolitical boundaries that divide the world into the Global South and the Global North make sure that patterns of systemic discrimination continue, as the impacts of climate change, natural disasters and pollution fall disproportionately on communities in low-income nations. The insatiable appetite of wealthy nations like Australia for digging up and burning coal, oil and gas is sealing an unpalatable fate for billions of people around the world. We are witnesses to an intergenerational and global theft that will deprive future generations of the opportunity to make a dignified life and where countries least responsible for the climate crisis are already living through the worst of it. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pacific islanders are watching their homes and their homelands sink as their very existence is threatened by sea-level rise, flooding and coastal erosion. Their children and grandchildren will bear the brunt of Australia's inaction. They've urged the Morrison government to take urgent action on climate. They have pleaded with us. They have condemned us for our weak and unambitious targets. They are demanding we honour the global climate accord.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, during the Copenhagen Accord, wealthy nations committed to US$100 billion in international climate finance funding each year, by 2030, but they have fallen far short of this. They have failed the nations which they have used as dumping grounds for their greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia too has failed to pay our fair share of climate finance and reparations commensurate with our historical and ongoing contribution to the climate crisis. The Liberal-National government have not made a single payment to the Green Climate Fund since 2018. Today, a group of NGOs have called on Australia to rise to the challenge and immediately double climate finance contributions to $3 billion over the period from 2020 to 2025. That's the very least we can do. The Greens believe that we should add another $1.5 billion to this in direct reparations for the damage already done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The inequality between the Global North and South is rooted in the exploitative, extractive and destructive legacy of colonialism and imperialism. This is an issue of global justice. It is about righting historic wrongs. These payments are not favours bestowed, they are debts owed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is not at all interested in honouring commitments to the Green Climate Fund or paying its fair share of climate finance. Australia is dead last on climate action out of 193 UN member countries. It is so embarrassing, sad and heartbreaking to see that we have become such laggards on climate action and protecting the environment. When the world was debating solutions to climate change, the Liberals were still fighting over whether it exists. Now we are in a critical decade and the world has moved on to talking about 2030 targets, but the Liberals and Nationals are fighting over 2050.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public poll after poll reveals how the vast majority of people living in Australia want real action on climate. Even that is not enough to wake up the Liberals from their climate stupor. But they are getting better at greenwashing, like their partners, the News Corp media. They're both trying to rewrite history with their miserable commitments on the one hand, while still pushing dirty coal, oil and gas on the other. Here's a newsflash for you: no-one has forgotten that News Corp and the Liberals and Nationals blocked climate action for decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to stop digging up coal, gas and oil. It's time to stop handing millions of dollars of public money over to billionaires, hoping they will save us from the climate crisis. This is utter stupidity. It's time to aim high, to legislate a 75 per cent emissions cut by 2030 and net zero by 2035. It's way beyond time to take responsibility for the role that we have played in creating the climate crisis. We must fulfil our obligations. We must pay our fair share. Let's go to Glasgow COP26 with our heads held high as leaders, not as outliers. It's time for climate justice.</span>

                    </a>  Great. Thank you, Mr President. This disallowance motion is an important one because we know that this government—despite telling the Australian people that they want to reduce pollution to zero by 2050 and despite begging their Nationals colleagues to allow this—right here, right now, today, want to hand $2 billion of taxpayers' money over to the fossil fuel companies. This is more money in the pockets of the fossil fuel industry—more subsidies, more taxpayers' money and more rorts for the fossil fuel industry, designed to prop them up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you that there is no way this government will ever be taken seriously when it comes to climate action and reducing pollution while it continues not just to give a nod and a wink to the fossil fuel industry to keep expanding and growing but to actually prop them up and pay for them to keep expanding and growing. We know that this is another $2 billion to the government's mates in the fossil fuel industry. It's a total of almost $10 billion in subsidies in this financial year alone, the 2021 financial year. It is just extraordinary that this type of money is being handed out willy-nilly by this government yet we're all meant to believe that somehow the Prime Minister has found his path to Damascus on climate change and everything's going to be okay. You can't be taken seriously on climate action and reducing pollution if, on one hand, you're saying you won't even legislate targets and, on the other hand, what you are legislating is tax windfalls and cash handouts for the fossil fuel industry to keep polluting day after day after day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What else have we got from this government in terms of subsidies to the fossil fuel industry beyond this $2 billion? Well, there's the $226 million in subsidies for the Beetaloo basin. There's the approval for more coalmines. In the last month alone, we've seen four new coalmines approved by Mr Morrison's own environment minister—four, and we know there are 72 new coal mines on the books, ready to go, ready to be approved—tick, tick, tick—by this government, along with another 44 gas projects. You could not imagine the hypocrisy from the government—the hypocrisy that smacks us in the face every day when they talk about wanting to take climate action yet, at the same time, they continue to give a green light to the polluting industries to keep going harder, faster and more and more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the International Energy Agency that not one new fossil fuel project can be approved or allowed to open if we want to get to net zero. That's not the Greens saying that. That's not the Australian people saying that. That's the International Energy Agency saying that. Yet, time after time after time, on one hand the Prime Minister says he understands that climate change is here, and on the other hand the government not only approve these developments but are now handing out cash, Australian taxpayer money, to prop them up and to allow the industry to keep expanding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular slush fund for the fossil fuel industry consists of $2 billion of Australians' money being spent to continue to pollute through what the government have called the fuel security services payment. That sounds nice, doesn't it? This is taxpayer money continuing to allow more and more pollution in this country. We're being told by the minister in charge that this is needed to provide fuel security in this country. Well, do you know what this government should have done? This government should have, indeed, invested in a strategy to make sure we had proper transport security in this country by investing in a plan to deliver electric vehicles on our roads and investing in public transport. How about some emissions standards in this country for vehicles? That is the type of plan and action that would deliver security to Australians and to our climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fuel security framework could have been used as an opportunity to address emissions from the transport sector, which, by the way, we know is one of the fastest growing sectors in terms of emissions in this country at 17.6 per cent, and it's growing faster and faster at the exact time that we are meant to be reducing the pollution that is choking our planet. So we could have had an opportunity to invest in reducing pollution in the transport sector, but, instead, we have this on our books. We could have had an opportunity to reduce pollution and to invest in the security of our fuel future in this country. Instead, we have a taxpayer fund propping up an industry that is already struggling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if you don't accept that we need to reduce pollution, this fuel security service payment doesn't actually do what it's supposed to do. It doesn't reduce dependency on fuel. In fact, what it does is keep refineries open past their expiry date, propping them up and making them more and more unsustainable, with no accompanying plans to support a transition away from dirty fuel to cleaner types of emissions and energy to power our transport networks across the country. It's actually increasing and deepening the insecurity here in Australia. This $2 billion would have been better spent investing in an electric vehicle strategy for this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transport sector, as I said, is one of the fastest growing when it comes to emissions in this country. It already accounts for 17.6 per cent of the total pollution, and that's growing faster every day. We need a national electric vehicle strategy. It was promised by the government, but we still haven't seen anything delivered. It could have included financial incentives to encourage consumer uptake, like there have been in other parts of the world. We could have charging infrastructure to ensure that there is security and assurance and confidence in the consumer market when it comes to electric vehicles. And, of course, it would be very helpful in this country if we had fuel emission standards, like every other comparable country in the world, regulatory changes and a plan that would drive our nation to be one where we invest in electric vehicles and have low-emission standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is lagging, just like we are in so many other parts in relation to climate action, behind the rest of the world. We are lagging behind when it comes to the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable fuel options, and this is just another blatant example. In other countries where they have actually invested and put in place plans to ensure that there are vehicle emission standards and where there is a vision from their governments to drive down pollution and to ensure that consumers have a choice that is cleaner, greener and safer not just for our streets but actually for our planet, we have seen the uptake of EV and electric vehicle sales skyrocket. Norway is up to 74.8 per cent and the UK is at 10.7 per cent. The global average is 4.2 per cent. Australia lags behind at well below one per cent at 0.78 per cent. The facts speak for themselves. Australia is again lagging behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, who loses out? It's our climate, our environment and the consumer. If we were to invest properly in this nation in the infrastructure, the policies and the regulatory framework, we could be driving down pollution and we could be putting faster, cheaper and more sustainable vehicles on our roads. Think about the amount of money that Australian households could save if they were able to purchase an affordable electric vehicle. We're talking about saving up to $5,000 per household per year. That's a massive windfall for any Australian household. Just compare the fuel costs: 12c per kilometre versus 5c per kilometre. That's the type of comparison that we're talking in running an electric vehicle versus running a vehicle that spews out pollution, powered by dirty fossil fuels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we'd need a plan and a vision from this government. We'd need a government that cared deeply about the state of our climate and the state of our environment. All we get at the moment is weasel words and greenwashing. We've got a fake fight going on between the Liberal Party and the National Party over something that actually means zilch when you compare it to what the rest of the world is confronting and will be debating in two weeks time when the Prime Minister goes to Glasgow. He wants to make this whole debate about net zero by 2050, when that is well past its use-by date. We are already in the grips of the final decade we have to cut pollution, to make the changes necessary, and that is why comparable countries and world leaders are meeting in two weeks time to debate and discuss how collectively their countries and the world will be cutting pollution by 2030. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we don't start doing it in that time frame, we risk mass extinction of animals, of species, and terrible, intense events like bushfires and massive storms ripping through our cities, our towns and our regions. If we don't make the changes we need in the next decade, we will miss the boat when it comes to reducing pollution and stopping runaway climate change. The science is very clear. The facts are very clear. Rather than doing what the government proposes today, which is handing $2 billion to the fossil fuel industry, to the big petrol companies, the government should be investing that $2 billion into types of transport and vehicles that are cleaner, greener and smarter for Australian consumers and households—the types of vehicles we want to see on our roads. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I urge the Senate to support this disallowance, because this is just dumb policy by a thick government and by a sneaky Prime Minister. You say one thing over here and look like you have even learnt how to say the words 'climate change', while on the other hand you continue to dip into taxpayers' money to pay your mates in the fossil fuel industry. It is a tricky Prime Minister who, on one hand, says he cares about the environment and, on the other hand, tells the big polluters to go rip on the taxpayers' dollar. </span>

We've announced our own electric car discount, which will cut more than $200 million in inefficient taxes from battery, electric and fuel cell cars. But the reality is that most of Australia's fleet and many other sectors, such as agriculture and aviation, remain reliant on fuel. The payment that the Greens party is seeking to disallow is designed to ensure the operation of Australia's two remaining refineries until at least 2027. The government introduced the payment too late, after half of Australia's refineries had announced their closures. Nonetheless it is a welcome measure to improve our fuel security, and Labor supported the legislation under which this rule has been made. Unlike the Greens party, Labor understands the importance of fuel security for Australia and will therefore not support this motion.</span>

Whilst I do agree with many of the good ideas the Greens are putting forward and the need for us to move to electric vehicles as soon as possible, we do have a fuel security issue in Australia. We only have something like 25 to 30 days of fuel. This does something to remedy that and make sure that we do have some onshore processing. I recall a couple of years ago Exercise Pitch Black, in the Northern Territory, in which the Air Force basically ran out of fuel. We can't have that sort of situation. I recognise that we need to move to a low-carbon society and move away from fossil fuels, but we have got to do so in a responsible manner.</span>

ASIC is undertaking an ongoing investigation into the conduct of a number of entities and offices within the Sterling Group of companies. Matters relating to the Sterling Income Trust have been the subject of litigation and the government does not wish to prejudice any possible future proceedings. On 19 November 2020, the Federal Court in Western Australia found Theta Asset Management, the responsible entity for Sterling Income Trust, and its managing director, Mr Robert Marie, contravened the Corporations Act on multiple occasions. The court ordered Theta to pay a penalty of $2 million and ordered Mr Marie to pay a penalty of $100,000. The government notes the impact of the failure on investors' residential tenancies are matters most appropriately considered at the state level, given these matters come under state laws.</span>

In such cases, prescribed or approved forms will still appear of the Federal Register of Legislation. There are also circumstances where the use of a particular form is not important, but the mandating of requirements in legislation is important. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will establish the Australian Federal Integrity Commission - a new independent body responsible for implementing a national pro-integrity framework, with an emphasis on prevention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to acknowledge Dr Helen Haines, the Member for Indi, who introduced essentially the same bill into the House of Representatives in October 2020, and who has led the drafting and refinement of this bill as a consensus proposal since the beginning of this Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the right bill for the Senate to debate, and this is the right time for the Senate to have this debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill would restore the public's trust, confidence, and pride in the integrity of their Members of Parliament and their democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Federal Integrity Commission, or 'AFIC', will have appropriate and proportionate powers of assessment, investigation, and referral. This will enable clear and practical responses to allegations of serious and systemic corruption issues at the federal level in the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AFIC will be empowered to receive and consider public referrals. It is absolutely vital that any Australian and all decent public servants have a reputable body they can trust with corruption concerns and that will protect and support them as whistleblowers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a safeguard, this bill also includes statutory definitions for frivolous, vexatious, or otherwise baseless claims. These provisions will allow the Commission to vet referrals and protect reputations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AFIC would also be retrospective. I want to be clear: this bill does not apply new laws to past facts. If conduct was criminal at the time, it was criminal at the time. All integrity commissions at state level are retrospective. This bill is no different in that regard and allows AFIC to look into the past so we can learn from our mistakes and improve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AFIC will also give more than lip service to advancing a pro-integrity agenda though well-resourced education, prevention, training, policy leadership and research initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AFIC will also work off a clear and sensible definition of corruption that is fit for purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When it comes to investigations and inquiries, AFIC must focus on conduct that is serious or systemic in nature, such as conduct that constitutes a criminal offence, grounds for dismissal or a substantial breach of an applicable code of conduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AFIC will also be empowered to hold public hearings when in the public interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I know Dr Haines has spoken at length with many Members of Parliament in both Houses about their views on public hearings and has incorporated provisions in Part 6 of the bill to assuage their concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, all persons called to give evidence before AFIC will have a rolling right to request a private hearing and can present their reasons for this in private with the Commissioner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner must base that decision on the comprehensive public interest test in Section85, which balances the overarching need for transparency with countervailing factors, such as how serious or systemic the corruption issue at hand is in Australia, the confidential nature of any evidence such as journalistic sources, and any unfair exposure of a person's private life or unfair prejudice to personal reputation, even if by simple association with the Commission by name. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill is the culmination of over a decade of prior consultation, over a decade of committee inquiries and over a decade of evaluations of the strengths and witnesses of the ICAC laws that exist in every jurisdiction in this country except this one. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill has the endorsement of some of the finest legal minds from the High Court, Federal Court and Supreme Courts across this nation. The Centre for Public Integrity has ranked this bill the best in the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As put by the Hon. Margaret White, the former Judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland and the first woman to claim such a title: <span style="font-style:italic;">"When it is established, for surely it will be as no right-thinking pers</span><span style="font-style:italic;">on could resist the principles which underpin it, it will elevate Australian public life immeasurably." </span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's now been over 1000 days since the Prime Minister promised this nation a robust federal integrity commission. Australians are still waiting, and they should not hold their breath waiting any longer for this Government to deliver a robust model. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has refused to introduce a bill to this place. It has sat on its dud Commonwealth Integrity Commission proposal through round after round of consultation and refused to amend it. The Centre for Public Integrity has classified the Government's proposal as the 'weakest watchdog in the country'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All but two of the 300 submissions to the Government's last consultation roundly criticised the bill. It is unworkable, and unsalvageable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With respect to colleagues on both sides, a bill for a federal integrity commission would be ill-fated if it came from any of the major parties. It will almost certainly descend into partisan games and mudslinging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An important reform like this must come through the middle, from the crossbench.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Questions of integrity have plagued this Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians do not want to head into the next election without a robust federal integrity commission. This is the way we deliver it. If the Government wants to act on its election commitment, it should amend this bill and abandon its own.</span>
                </p>

The 2019 bill sought to allow consumers on the Do Not Call Register to opt out of receiving any telemarketing call made on behalf of a registered charity. This bill does not include those provisions, in part because of the sector's efforts since then to address problems of fundraising harassment, making this issue less acute. Meanwhile, the issue of unsolicited political texts is ongoing and unresolved.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Amendment (Temporary Visa Extensions and Reinstatements) Bill 2021</span> is to provide uniform and automatic extensions to time-limited temporary visa subclasses where the visa holder has been stranded overseas and unable to enter the country due to closure of Australia's international border during the human biosecurity emergency period under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015</span>, which has been in place since 17 March 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's international border was closed on 20 March 2020 by a biosecurity emergency period, as provided by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015</span>, in response to the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the time of Australia's international border closure, many thousands of temporary visa holders - some of whom have lived in Australia for many years on a pathway to permanent residency - were overseas but living and working in Australia at the time. Due to the necessary speed of the border closure, most were unable to return to Australia before the closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The international border closure also affected a large cohort of visa holders who had received their visa grants, quit their jobs, packed up their homes, sent their possessions to Australia, only to be unable to move to Australia themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through no fault of their own, this situation has had a devastating impact on many temporary visa holders, and on their workplaces, communities, and families, as many affected temporary visa holders have been separated from incomes, partners, and children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will provide concessions to temporary visa holders who have been stranded overseas because of Australia's international border closure with uniform and automatic visa extensions that will enable them to receive all the rights and privileges within the conditions of the visa they paid for and were granted. For many temporary visa holders, this will mean being able to continue on their visa pathways following the re-opening of our international borders without further disadvantage, penalty, or forfeiture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Automatic extensions have already been provided to holders of a Prospective Marriage visa (subclass 300) or a Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa (subclass 870). This legislation will ensure that all eligible temporary visas are treated uniformly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Eligible temporary visas will be any temporary visa whose holder was, at any point during the visa period, unable to enter Australia only because of its international border closure under a travel restriction imposed by the Commonwealth Government, such as the COVID-19 human biosecurity emergency period. This means that this provision will not apply if the temporary visa holder was unable to enter Australia for some other reason in addition to the travel ban, such as medical advice that they should not fly, financial issues, conditions on the visa, etc.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The legislation will do this by providing automatic visa extensions for existing temporary visa holders who are, or have been, stranded offshore while holding valid temporary visas. Eligible temporary visas will be automatically credited with the amount of time the temporary visa holder has lost due to Australia's international border closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The maximum possible extension provided under the Bill will be the full amount of days Australia's international border was closed under a travel restriction imposed by the Commonwealth Government, such as the COVID-19 human biosecurity emergency period. Temporary visa holders whose visas were in effect during the entire border closure period and who were unable to enter Australia at all would receive the maximum extension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, extensions to the balance of an eligible temporary visa could be less than the maximum amount provided for by the Bill and will vary based on individual visa conditions and circumstances. Some temporary visa holders may be granted a travel exemption and re-enter Australia before the international border is reopened, some may have been granted a visa after the international border was closed, and others may have a temporary visa that was granted for a period less than Australia' international border closure period; for example, if Australia's international border is closed for 24 months, the maximum a 12-month visa could be extended for under the Bill is 12 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also provide for automatic visa reinstatements of temporary visas for persons whose visas have expired by the time Australia's international borders open. These reinstated visas will then be eligible for the automatic extensions provided by this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides a long-overdue plan for the thousands of temporary visa holders who have been severed from their homes, their incomes, and their families for 19 months and counting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government and the Department of Home Affairs have suggested that if a temporary visa holder has been stranded abroad and separated from their family, their family should leave Australia and join them overseas - or, to use their exact turn-of-phrase, these people should just "go home".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This simply isn't good enough and speaks volumes on how the Government regards these people who, when we needed them, were there for us. We invited these people into our country, and they came, they built homes, they built careers, and they built families. They built lives here, while strengthening our economy, paying taxes, contributing to our rich cultural diversity, and making huge commitments to our modern, multicultural country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But now that they are the ones that need us, the Government has told them to "go home". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of these temporary visa holders are working their way through various student and skilled visas on a pathway to permanent residency. Once a temporary resident is eligible for permanent residency, an application for a permanent resident visa can take well over a year to process. Many of these people have been here for many, many years and are, for all intents and purposes, Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through no fault of their own, they have lost months, if not years here in Australia. They jumped every hurdle and ticked every box that our strict migration regime demanded of them. For them to now lose their right to be in this country would be unjust and unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is about setting that right, to the greatest degree possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  The cashless debit card is a program for working age payment recipients to help stabilise their lives and get them on a pathway to work and provide opportunity for individuals, their families and communities. Those on the other side should be ashamed of the way they're obsessed with playing politics with this issue. They supported the cashless debit card being introduced in 2015 and through its expansion, up until the 2019 election, when they decided to put politics above people. And now they're running a shameful scare campaign aimed at age pensioners. It is disgusting. The government has never had and will never have a plan to force age pensioners onto the cashless debit card. First Labor wanted a retirees tax and now they're lying to retirees. What's next? Unlike those opposite, we have always been transparent with the Australian people about our plans for the cashless debit card. We will not oppose this OPD.</span>

Cabinet confidentiality is a foundation principle of the Westminster system dating back to the 1600s.

Cabinet documents will continue to be released in the agreed-upon manner prescribed under the Archives Act 1983.</span>

                    </a>  Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Senator Canavan is correct, this time, that cabinet modelling on 2050 net zero is rubbish and it should be released for public examination and scrutiny. There is simply no path to net zero under which gas will increase. The modelling will show what the cabinet wants it to show in order to solve the government's political problem—that they can convince their MPs that there's some magical fairyland ahead where demand for Australia's fossil fuels will be greater than it is today. But in fact the International Energy Agency just last week surveyed those countries that have lifted their 2030 targets—customers of our coal and gas exports—and their analysis was that, if they meet those commitments, global use of fossil fuels will peak by 2025 and fall thereafter. They can also expect the clean energy market under net zero to be worth $1.2 trillion a year, greater than today's oil market. So let's not waste any more time and get on with creating the hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  As I rise to make my first speech, I'd first like to acknowledge that the lands we gather on today are those of the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, and I pay my respects to their elders, past, present and emerging. I would also like to pay my respects to the Kaurna elders, past, present and emerging, on whose land I live. I pay my respects to the elders of all the lands surrounding the Kaurna land: Ngadjuri, Peramangk, Ngarrindjeri, Narungga and Nukunu—all these nations surround the Kaurna nation—and the 40-plus nations that comprise South Australia. I understand that your lands were never ceded and that it always was and always will be Aboriginal land. I also understand the dire consequences of colonialisation and dispossession and what was done to First Nations people, and I am committed to working to right these wrongs. And this starts with a commitment to genuine and meaningful voice, treaty and truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to this place under sad circumstances with the passing of Senator Alex Gallacher. I offer my condolences to Alex's family, and I pay my respects to the hard work he did and dedication he had in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am honoured to be here today as a representative of the people of South Australia. It is a vibrant, progressive and inclusive part of this country, and I am proud that I have been calling South Australia home for 20 years. I was born to a large Irish Catholic family in south-west London. I grew up in a housing estate at the world's end, and I spent my summers in Ireland with my extended family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father, Larry Grogan, was a shop steward with the Transport and General Workers Union, and he was the one that introduced me to the Labor movement and the class struggle. He taught me the potency and power of working people acting collectively to improve their circumstances and that of their workmates and their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My mother, Kathleen Grogan, taught me the value and importance of community. She spent her life looking after other people. She instilled in me a deep belief that I could do anything and has always, always stood beside me regardless of the scrapes I got myself into. Mum, without you, I wouldn't be here. You are my strongest supporter, and you give me strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given my parents' influence it's probably not surprising that I spent my working life focusing on social and economic justice, fighting to improve the rights of low-paid and vulnerable workers, fighting for better primary care, early intervention in health, a fairer education for all of our kids and an increase to social services and opportunities for those who don't have them. But it was my earliest experiences in Australia that ignited a passion to fight for change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1990 I came to this country. I bought a 1967 Holden station wagon, and I drove around Australia. My love for Australia's spectacular and diverse environment was born. I picked mangoes in the Northern Territory, I worked as a labourer in the vast cane lands of North Queensland, and I ironed shirts in Brisbane and poured beers in bars all over the country. I fell in love with Australia and its vast cultural diversity, and I was lucky enough to be able to emigrate here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Four years later, as an Australian citizen, I was employed, I was independent, I was in a relationship that I thought was good, I had a safe place to live, I was pregnant and I was really excited for the future. But, in the space of a few short weeks, all that changed. My unborn baby was very sick. My partner couldn't handle the thought of a sick baby, so he left. I was a contract worker, and, because of my baby's sickness, I could no longer work. I ended up sleeping on the floor of a friend's place. I was 14,000 miles away from my family, and I was scared. I needed help. I was lucky I had very good friends who, along with Medicare and our social welfare system, where there for me and my son in those really difficult times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My son, Brendan, is 26 now. He is healthy, funny, compassionate and a great joy in my life. But that experience of feeling powerless, feeling scared, being judged for being poor, being treated differently because I was a single parent and being at the mercy of the health system made me absolutely determined to make things better for other people. I've seen firsthand the challenges and inequities that people face. Indeed, I have lived them. Without the stalwart policies of previous Labor governments, I don't know what would have happened to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the path I chose from there was research, policy, advocacy and fighting for those who are marginalised in our community and who are without a voice. I have worked in many of the key areas of Labor's road map for the future: environment, climate, mental health, education and social services. Working in these areas, I have seen the challenges, but I have also seen the opportunities and I have seen the solutions, and I want to be part of the team that is fighting to bring those to fruition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been fortunate. I have had an interesting and varied career. But I have also worked very hard. I spent time as the head of the South Australian Council of Social Service, championing social justice issues. I've sat on the board of ACOSS. I worked in the university sector, developing pathways for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to both access and succeed in higher education. I worked for the Central Land Council in Alice Springs, fighting for the rights of First Nations people. I spent time as the head of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists to tackle climate change and protect the River Murray. I have also worked within the ALP: first as chief of staff to the then federal minister Mark Butler, working on aged care, mental health, climate and energy policy; and then for the former South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill, where I was responsible for social services, environment and the River Murray. I would like to thank Mark and Jay for their support, wisdom and friendship and for believing in me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My last job before entering the Senate was as a senior official with the United Workers Union, representing some of the most vulnerable and low-paid workers in our community. I will continue to be a proud member of the Australian trade union and labour movements and will continue to fight for workers' pay and conditions during my time here. I remain a proud member of the United Workers Union, and I offer my thanks to Gary Bullock and the politics team at UWU, for being such staunch advocates for their members, and also to the Australian Services Union—a big shout-out to Abbie Spencer and the South Australian team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My experiences, my family and my work history have all led me to this place. They've given me the deep passion to want to fight for vulnerable people and vulnerable workers. I want to be in the room where the decisions are made, where policy is developed and where change can truly happen to make our country more equitable. I am here to represent the people I have spent my career working with and for. Those people want decent, well-paid, secure jobs so they can have a stable roof over their heads. They want decent, secure jobs for their kids so they can have hope for the future. They want a hospital bed when they need it and a COVID jab so that they can help get our economy back on track. And, more than anything, Australians want a reliable system that gives people a hand-up when they most need it: when health issues strike or when they lose their job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not seeing that leadership in Australia. In fact, we seem to be going backwards. Social services are being cut, people on welfare are being victimised and, for those lucky enough to find a job despite the struggles they face, their work is precarious and it is low-paid The policies that have been implemented in recent times have made it even harder for people doing it tough. Harder to access services, with more and more hoops to jump through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many parts of the country, in South Australia there are just not enough employment or training opportunities—and an alarming number of jobs are casual and insecure. The number of people in full-time work in South Australia fell by 2,300 in September, earning us the nation's highest unemployment rate, at 5.1 per cent, for the sixth time this year. Meanwhile, South Australia's youth unemployment rate rose from 9.2 per cent to 11 per cent and the underemployment rate increased to 8.4 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite inequities in the labour market, where you can work 50 hours a week and still struggle to put a roof over your head and a meal on the table, the government of the day continues to attack workers pay and conditions. COVID-19 has highlighted how fragile and precarious our industrial relations system is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The binary approach to the haves and the have-nots ignores the fact that the success of a business is reliant on the strength of its workers. Whether you are a cleaner, a childcare worker, an accountant, or a farmhand your role is essential in the success of the organisation you work for, and you should be respected and valued for that role. I do believe in the role of business to help build our economic future, but it must be built on a fair relationship with workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 has also highlighted how fragile and precarious our health system can be without proper funding and resourcing, including our mental health services. I will fight for more services to deal with the increasing mental health impacts of COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people in particular are finding it too difficult to access appropriate mental health services. We owe it to them to have help available when they need it most, and I applaud Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews for his recent introduction of mental health specialists in Victorian schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be part of an Albanese Labor government that is committed to creating decent, well-paid, secure jobs; one that values universal access to health care and an equitable education system; a government that understands the importance of everyone having a roof over their heads, so they can envisage a fair future for themselves and their family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be part of a generation of Australian politicians that works to rebuild faith in our democratic systems, a generation that uses their precious time here to extend our imaginations in order to resolve the complex societal and environmental problems we face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I intend on being staunch advocate for the River Murray and the communities that rely on it for sustenance, and a thorn in the side of those vested interests who continue take more than their share. Our state's social, cultural and economic life is closely entwined with the river and therefore its health and our long-term survival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, I would just like to thank just a few of the many people who've supported and inspired me. Everyone in the SA Labor Party, but most particularly Mark Butler, Jay Weatherill, Penny Wong, Kyam Maher and Susan Close. I thank the great people in the environment and climate movement, particularly the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, who are truly dedicated to a sustainable future. And I thank Felicity Wade and Lyndon Schneiders for always inspiring me, uncomfortable as it may be at times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the COSS movement and all the people who've supported me in the community sector, most particularly Ian Yates. And my deep thanks to the beautiful people I call family: my amazing mum, my sister, Liz, and all my family overseas; my son, Brendan, and the other beautiful children so dear to my heart—Aaron, Ruby, Tom, Adele, Paddy, James and Pippa; my fierce goddaughters, Maddie and Jess; and also Samantha, Krista, Brodie, Ben, Bethany, Alisha, and Lou. And, within that family, a particular shout-out to the two women who have stood beside me for decades, who shared the tears, the laughter, kicked my butt when I needed it, who have never ever ever let me give up, Lesley Parker and Caroline Gaston. I am here because of you all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These speeches are a time to place on record who you are so that the people of Australia know more about those who are representing them: I am a feminist; I am a unionist; I am a community activist; I am an environmentalist; I am an immigrant; I am a South Australian. I believe in truth, treaty and voice for First Nations people, and I believe in the value of each and every South Australian. I will fight for the rights and opportunities of our community. And I will fight for a Labor government, led by Anthony Albanese, to realise a fair and equitable future. Thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to contribute to this debate today, and it is an important debate because, in less than two weeks time, the Prime Minister of this country is going to be travelling to Glasgow to meet with world leaders in relation to the biggest threat that humanity has seen, and that, of course, is climate change and the climate crisis, a crisis that has been brought about by the enormous amounts of pollution that are pumped into our atmosphere because of the burning of fossil fuels. f course, one of the key elements that world leaders like the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Scott Morrison, are being asked to contribute to this most important global meeting is a commitment to cut pollution and to stop expanding the projects that make climate change worse.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Energy Agency has said in no uncertain terms that there can be no more new oil, gas or coal projects opened, created or built if we are to achieve zero pollution and a target for net zero pollution in order to keep temperatures at below 1.5 degrees, which is what we know we need if we are to stop the most dangerous elements of climate change. Only a couple of months ago, last time the Senate was meeting here in this place, we were discussing and debating the recent report by the world's leading climate scientists. They said we have less than a decade to take the urgent action needed—less than a decade to cut pollution to keep the rise in temperature below that important element of 1.5 degrees—if we are to have a fighting chance of stopping runaway climate change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can already see the effect of climate change all around us. Only two summers ago we saw those devastating bushfires rip through bushland in regional and rural Australia. We saw billions of hectares of Australia's forests and wilderness areas go up in smoke. We saw three billion animals in this country perish because of those bushfires. We saw dozens of towns and cities in this country choked with smoke.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 has brought about an enormous amount of concern and fear right around the world. Governments have been called to take urgent action to stop the spread of this most devastating disease. Governments, largely, have responded—of all political persuasions, at all levels. Governments and political leaders have listened to the science, listened to the experts, and taken the swift action needed to stop the spread and the escalation of this disease. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we saw the same type of response from our political leaders that we've seen in relation to COVID-19 for action to save the climate and our planet—listening to the science, taking the swift action that's needed, showing leadership and investing in the transition to an economy and a society that is cleaner, greener and safer.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we thought that the crippling effect of COVID-19, a disease that has ripped through not just our communities in Australia but around the world, was bad, just wait until we see the diseases that rip through our communities when climate change really hits. The experts tell us that's what's coming—unless we take the action that's needed in the next decade to cut pollution. That's why, as a country, we need to be taking to the world's most important summit— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281697" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New </span><span class="HPS-Electorate">South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  Yet again we have the Greens wanting us to strive for some ideal at the expense of jobs, industry and our community. Make no mistake: this is what we look forward to, potentially, under an Albanese-Greens coalition government. Seventy-five per cent emissions reduction by 2030 is the target the Greens are saying. Senator Gallagher refused to say that Labor would have a target for 2030 or to announce their target yet—but the Greens are doing it for you, Senator Gallagher. They want 75 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. But what the Greens like to keep ignoring is what we have already achieved to date. I've spoken about it already today in this chamber, and I will continue to speak about it time and time again because I am sick to death of people ignoring what Australians have already done. I am sick to death of people from this nation saying Australians are laggards and denialists when so many Australians are not—not the National Party and certainly not regional Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 20 per cent emissions reduction that we have already achieved to date from 2005 levels, 71 per cent has come from agricultural land use changes and a reduction in agricultural emissions. Our agricultural industries have done the heavy lifting, and yet we have people over there on the crossbench trying to tell us that we should stop eating meat because cows fart. Well, excuse me. They're saying we should stop planting crops like rice because it uses too much water. They're saying we should make sure our farmers can't clear their land but that it's okay to clear 125 square kilometres in the centre of Australia for solar farms. The hypocrisy is unbelievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus today on agriculture and forestry, because forestry is part of the solution that keeps getting ignored by those on the crossbench. Forestry keeps getting closed down by those opposite and their state counterparts. Forestry is the best carbon sequestration you can have. The trees grow and they absorb carbon. Then you turn those trees into furniture, like what we are surrounded by here today. This room is sequestering tonnes of carbon forever. But those on the crossbench would rather us lock up land and just walk away. I can tell you, while that absorbs carbon in some stages, it plateaus at a certain point in time and it is not sequestered for good. It actually starts to become carbon positive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to focus on what is actually going to achieve real outcomes, and what is achieving real outcomes is what our agricultural industry is doing. The work our meat industry has done with the CSIRO and James Cook University, developing new feed regimes for livestock, is leading to world-leading outcomes. Net greenhouse gas emissions from the red meat sector in Australia are less than half what they were in 2005. The red meat sector have cut their emissions by 50 per cent already. It is by far the greatest reduction by any single sector in Australia's economy. I congratulate them, and I congratulate the CSIRO for its world-leading work in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through our government's commitments, we are providing over $1 million to an agricultural science company called Sea Forest. This grant will allow them to upscale their production of seaweed additive for livestock feed so the livestock sector can continue to cut emissions. The work that CSIRO is doing with the agricultural sector on soil carbon sequestration through cropping regimes is world leading. Why aren't we talking about this? Why aren't we talking about these ground-breaking innovations that support existing industries and create new jobs and new research that we can sell to the world?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, no, they'd rather focus on the negatives. They would rather focus on the fact that we still have coalmines. And so we should. Because our coal is the highest-energy, lowest-emission coal in the world. I would rather see one of the 129 new coal-fired power stations currently being constructed around the world—in net zero countries—burn our higher-energy, lower-emissions coal than dirty brown coal from another nation that emits more. I would rather see Australia use our gas—our natural resources—to produce blue hydrogen than burn dirtier products with higher emissions to do the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson going around saying, 'Aren't we good.' They're flying off into space in, yes, hydrogen powered rockets. Congratulations. The only pollution from those rockets is oxygen and water—very clean. Read the fine print. With that hydrogen that they are using to produce enough hydrogen to power those rockets, they need to burn fossil fuel. That's because industry isn't ready and can't yet produce enough green hydrogen for those rockets. But we're all putting Bezos on a pedestal because he's exploring the new frontier. I actually agree with Prince William on this. We need to focus on this planet, before we start ruining other planets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have grave concerns about the thought of mining the moon. I don't want to mine the moon. But I have no problems, in this country, when we know we need more lithium to produce the batteries that will underpin our renewable energy. I am very proud that Australia is one of the largest lithium producers in the world. I am very proud of our mineral sands resources sector that is producing the silicon, the silica and the other core ingredients so that we can actually have renewable power and electric vehicles. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So mining always will be part of the solution, and that includes our coalmining. Agriculture is part of our solution. Agriculture has already done the heavy lifting in Australia. The worst thing we can do to our agricultural sector is a repeat of what we signed up for with Kyoto. The worst thing we can do is tell our farmers: no, you can't clear that paddock that has the opportunity for soil carbon sequestration and food production. Let's not forget: Oxfam released a report in August raising red flags, because to plant enough trees to reach net zero—if you're just relying on planting trees—you will stop feeding the world. We are at risk of a food shortage. We need to work out how our agriculture can be a part of the solution, so that we can continue to feed the world. I'm not just talking about meat. Vegans need plants. It takes a lot of water to grow a soy crop. It takes a lot of soil carbon for that soy crop, but then it can be put back into the soil. We need to be working with our industries and embracing the innovations and the new technologies they have, and embracing the opportunities that a low-emissions future presents. I am not against a low-emissions future. What I am against is a blank cheque that allows people to trounce our industries, our people, and our communities, and that says, 'We will sign up to net zero at any cost.' I don't believe in ' at any cost'. I believe in opportunity. I believe in technology, not taxes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>): Listening to Senator Davey, you'd think that the Morrison government has some radical plan for our future and climate change, but we all know that it will be a plan to do very little. So I'm not quite sure what all of that carry on was about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about some of the points the senator made before I get to the motion itself. Eight years in office, 21 energy policies, yet all we've heard from the Morrison government this week is that a part of the Morrison government, the National Party, need more time. Australia hasn't got more time. We are sending the Prime Minister of this country to Glasgow in a few short weeks. And what's he got? Nothing at this point. He keeps saying that apparently he's going to make a decision with or without the Nationals. If you read between the lines, apparently the cabinet will make that decision. But some of the Nationals are in the cabinet. So, what are they going to do? Resign their commissions? Quite frankly, if they're not prepared to sign up to cabinet solidarity, that is what they should do. Otherwise, they're not entitled to stay there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the senator's comments was that we need to work out how agriculture contributes. Guess what? A lot of farmers are already contributing. How out of touch are you? How out of touch you are. I invite you to speak to the AgZero2030 group in Western Australia. They're a group of farmers and primary producers who are leading the way. They're not hobby farmers. They're farmers with broadacre who are leading the way. And, yes, some of them are planting trees. They want to see the Morrison government sign up to a net zero target. They want the research and development money. They want to stop doing it themselves and stop spending their own money. They want to have that research and development. That's what they want to contribute to. When you talk to them, they've got no idea where the Nationals are. In fact, Simon Wallwork, who owns a farm of almost 4,000 hectares with his partner Cindy in Corrigin, a farm I visited last year, believes that you're out of step. That's what he said on the ABC yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, when Senator McKenzie tried to represent the National Party as all-encompassing, I noticed that farmers were about fifth or sixth on the list that Senator McKenzie claimed to represent. You don't represent all of regional Australia. You didn't have a federal senator or MP in Western Australia the last time I looked, and you haven't had for quite some time. In fact, the leader of the state Nationals in WA, Mia Davies, is quite alarmed that Mr Joyce is the leader again. She's been very public about her comments. In 2018, she was one of the first to say that Mr Joyce should resign. When Mr Joyce topped Mr McCormack recently, she was the first to come out and say that he's got a lot of bridges to build, and she's still standing by the comments that she made in 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing you wouldn't have noticed Ms Davies say—because you're so obsessed with yourselves—was that Mr Joyce is a destabilising influence. She said that at the time. She must have had a crystal ball. What are we seeing right now? We are seeing that destabilisation absolutely on display. Ms Davies also went on to say that the Nationals were focused on themselves, on their own internal matters. Well, that's all we've seen this week—the Nationals breaking out, trying to hold not only the Morrison government to ransom but Australia to ransom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about this motion from the Greens. It demonstrates, once again, that they're not serious about being part of an Australian climate change solution. Instead, they're playing their immature game of making themselves the story for a moment of social media glory in a week when the Morrison government is in disarray over climate change. Seriously, is this motion the best they can do? It doesn't even name the government. It certainly doesn't name their recalcitrant rump—that handful of members from the National Party who claim to represent regional and rural Australians, yet don't have a single National representative in the vast state of WA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's have a look at what is really going on here. We know that Mr Morrison is being held captive by the Nationals, holding Australia back and not allowing Australians to focus on the things that are really of interest to them, but let's look at the Greens' record when it comes to backing in good climate change policy. Who could forget the dirty deal the Greens did with the Liberal opposition when, together, they voted down Labor's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme? Without this scheme, the Greens have added about 218 million additional tonnes of carbon.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator LINES:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, you'll hear them carping, because they don't like to be confronted with the truth, but that is the truth. That's what killing off Labor's CPRS scheme has done. Thanks to the Greens, even though they'll carp, carry on, interject and try to put another spin on it, it's their actions, not ours, that have added millions of tonnes of carbon pollution. Let's also not forget that two Liberals were prepared to cross the floor to support Labor, so disgusted were they with the Greens and their dirty deal with the Liberals. That's how bad that deal was. Now the Greens are in here trying to present themselves as honest brokers. I'd say they're green with envy, not green environmentalists. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Mr Morrison, we've got a PM who has zero credentials on any commitment to mitigating climate change. We've got a PM who, instead, wants to cling to power at all costs. Who could forget that it was this Prime Minister who brought a lump of coal into the parliament, proudly declaring, 'Don't be afraid. Don't be scared. It won't hurt you'? He is a PM who won't support renewables, as he's on the record claiming that wind and solar are unreliable. Remember when he said that the wind doesn't blow all the time and the sun doesn't shine all the time? Then there was his scare campaign against electric vehicles, ably assisted by Senator Cash. The claim was that we'd all lose our weekends. Well, Mr Morrison and Senator Cash, I've recently purchased an electric vehicle. I did that because—guess what?—there's not one electric vehicle on the government's lease vehicles for senators and MPs, not one. So I went out and got my own. It's not one of the expensive ones; it's an MG, at about $44,000—still unaffordable for most Australians because the Morrison government don't put one ounce of subsidy behind that car. But, for the record, my weekend just got a whole lot better with that car. My MG is at home right now and, if my partner's been using it and it needs charging, on most days it will be taking advantage of the solar panels on my roof. I'm a lot better off already. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start of my contribution, WA farmers are pushing back against the Morrison government's failure to take emissions seriously. They really are. If you haven't introduced yourselves to AgZero2030, make sure you see the sort of work that they are doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I am most proud of is the WA Labor government. Again, you won't hear the Greens going on about the sorts of energy policies it's pursuing. I'm also proud to say that, despite many years of the Liberals trying to sell off and privatise WA power, it's probably the key thing that got McGowan across the line the first time we won the state election. Colin Barnett and the Liberals were hell-bent on selling Western Power, and Labor was hell-bent on making sure it wasn't sold. The WA Labor government is investing in solar panels. We had Onslow off the grid recently because of the use of solar panels, storage and good systems controls. We're doing microgrids, not just in the rural areas but in metro areas as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I say, you won't hear the Greens congratulating WA Labor and other governments on that, because it's all about their moment in the sun. With this motion, which is completely over the top and absolutely designed to get them a little moment on social media, they're another party focused on their internals and not on what is really happening. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I note this government's turn to the dark side. Pushing a zero carbon dioxide economy is gaining steam. 'The dark side' means sitting in the dark, because unreliable technologies like wind and solar will cause us all to be sitting in the dark, as is proven repeatedly overseas. These green boondoggles exist only to farm taxpayers' money, not energy. It's the ultimate irony that, when the Greens talk about a farm, they don't mean one that grows food and fibre; their wind and solar farms are made from communist China's industrial processes creating steel, fibreglass and concrete, the very things you can't make with green power. The Greens vision for Australia has no integrity because they claim so-called science has no integrity. It does not exist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is 772days  since I first challenged the former Greens Leader, Senator Di Natale, and the current Greens Leader in the Senate, Senator Waters, to provide the empirical scientific evidence justifying cutting carbon dioxide from human activity—nature's pure, clean trace gas essential for all life on our beautiful planet. I challenged them to debate me on the science and on the corruption of science. Senator Waters has been running from my challenge for 11 years—since I first challenged her as a joint panellist at a Brisbane climate forum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party should know that there's no compromising with the Greens, who responded to the Prime Minister's gutless, unfounded major shift in the way that any extortionist does: the Greens upped the ante. Rewarded, the Greens now call for 2035 carbon dioxide output to be 75 per cent of 2005 levels. Today, the media is reporting that a deal has been done between the Nationals and Prime Minister Morrison so he can jet to Glasgow with net zero and get his pat on the head from the elites, from his globalist masters. Mark my words, net zero will become 'Nat zero'. Minister Hunt won't even be able to claim the resulting death of the National Party as a COVID death; it's very assuredly suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the government's capitulation to green lunacy, many things will happen. Prime agricultural land will be put over to farming carbon rather than food, increasing feral animals and noxious weeds on productive land. Abandoned. The Howard-Anderson Liberal-National government's theft of property rights to implement the UN's Kyoto protocol will now be buried, so it cannot be restored, and there will be hundreds of billions of dollars in compensation. Buried. Farmers will experience more green tape and more blue UN tape, stealing more of their rights to use the land they bought and own. Family farms will disappear, a process well underway already. No new base-load power plants will be constructed. Mining industries will shut down and regional cities will be gutted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, the cost of renewables to Australian taxpayers is $19 billion a year—$1,300 a year for each household. To implement this agenda, this burden will more than double. It will savage the poor as a capricious, regressive tax. Every job created in the green economy costs three jobs in the productive economy—jobs lost to communist China. I expect we'll hear more about so-called clean smelting using hydrogen, an exhibit in the sideshow alley of green dishonesty. It will never be feasible without taxpayer subsidies or extreme inflation in the cost of building materials and housing. Adding the reduction in government revenue from a devastated regional economy, new energy subsidies and new subsidies for industries producing green boondoggles, the net zero policy's mountain of taxpayer debt will be visible from space. Net zero will require as much taxpayer money as we are now spending on health or education. What will that do to the health and education budget? Or is the Prime Minister planning to 'borrow, tax and spend' in the worst traditions of the Labor Party?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unreliable, expensive, parasitic malinvestment in so-called renewables—monstrosities that only last 15 years before they become toxic heavy metal industrial waste that cannot be safely disposed of. Every solar facility and every wind turbine in existence will need to be replaced before 2040. What a windfall that will be for the corporations that own this parliament—tens of billions of dollars in construction and operational subsidies to rebuild the national generating capacity from scratch, for no impact on earth's temperature! It is a great reset not just of electricity generation but of our entire economy. We're not transitioning from dirty industry to clean industry; we're transitioning from a somewhat free economy to a controlled economy. The winners will be large corporations; the losers will be every Australian trying to get ahead to survive. It is madness, it is inhuman, it is insanity. We will continue to oppose this nonsense.</span>

                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  The Greens really need to get with the times. They are falling behind the world, because the world can't get enough of Australian coal and Australian gas from your area, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan. They can't get enough of coal around the world. There is record demand for fossil fuels right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why there are record prices for our fossil fuels. Gas is trading at well over $30 a gigajoule in our region; it's up three times what it was a year ago. Coal prices are absolutely through the roof at record prices. No-one ever thought they'd see prices at over $200 a tonne for thermal coal and over $600 a tonne for coking coal from my area in Central Queensland. In each one of those trains that goes out past my place in Central Queensland, there is $5 million dollars for our nation at these prices. The rest of the world is just desperate for fossil fuels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go around the world and see what's happening. We've heard a lot this week about other countries signing up to net zero—doing something in 2050. But I think the best test of what someone's going to do in 2050 is probably what they're doing today, because talk is cheap. Countries can say whatever they like; what they do is much, much more important. So let's go around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In China over the past week, Premier Li came out and said that coal supply is crucial to people's lives. He made these remarks while urging coal power stations to go full throttle. They need them to fire up in China because they are running out of power, their lights are going off and electricity has been cut in many regions. At the same time, Premier Li also said that, given these energy security concerns, China would review its emissions targets. They would review when they are going to commit to emissions peaking. At the moment, China actually doesn't have to do anything. Their promise under the climate change agreements is to keep emitting until 2030, and then, they say, they're going to reduce emissions—they're going to do it in 10 years time! Now they're saying that they might not even do that. This whole climate cabal is falling apart before our eyes. Premier Li said that energy security would be China's priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In India, the government has mandated that 10 per cent of all coal used in power stations must be imported. Typically, India doesn't import that much coal or tries not to. It wants more imported coal to shore up their energy security. Thank God an Indian company was allowed to build a coal mine in North Queensland at the Carmichael mine site. That was pretty lucky for our country, because coal's in high demand and it's going to make a lot of money when those first trains go through Carmichael and out from Abbott Point later this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear a lot about the US—it's apparently the reason we've got to sign up to net zero. Apparently President Joe Biden has demanded that we do this. Well, in the US, President Biden has actually asked OPEC to increase oil production. He's asked OPEC—Middle Eastern countries—to increase oil production. His administration itself has put more restrictions on oil production and fracking in the US. The woke Wall Street bankers won't finance the fracking anymore through Texas and Oklahoma and other places, but they need the Middle Eastern countries to drill-baby-drill. Once again the Western world has been put at the behest of Middle Eastern oil sheikhs. It's an absolute disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the US wants us to commit to net zero and change our policy settings—apparently demanding it, we're told—they can't even pass legislation to implement their own climate commitments. It looks very likely that the US will go to Glasgow empty handed. That is despite the US Congress currently being Democrat controlled—the party of the President. The President has a clean electricity plan that he's trying to get through the Congress, but Senator Manchin from West Virginia is holding this up because, in relation to coal mines, he said: 'We want to make sure we have reliable power. They are not going to close.' That's what the people in the US want. That's probably what is going to happen in the US. So they can lecture us all they like, but there will be almost certainly no action there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go over to the UK because that is the most instructive country in this example. In fairness to the UK, they have acted; they have actually done stuff. They've closed coal-fired power stations, they're shutting down their North Sea oilfields and they've banned fracking across the whole country. They have reduced emissions more than any other developed country in the world—a gold star to the United Kingdom! How is it working out for them? Well we've all seen over the past couple of months that, if you're a resident in the UK, you've got to line up for petrol. It's back to the 1970s for the United Kingdom. They're lining up for petrol. Factories have closed all around the UK. Power companies have gone out of business because of surging energy prices and locked in retail prices. In the ultimate comical irony, they are running out of food because they are short of carbon dioxide. You need natural gas to make carbon dioxide and you need carbon dioxide to refrigerate food and transport it from the country to the city. They don't have enough carbon dioxide because Vladimir Putin is not sending them enough gas. They are running out of food. The UK government has had to bail out a major producer of carbon dioxide in the UK, CF Fertilisers. So taxes will go up more to subsidise something that used to be done without government subsidies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At least the UK are being been upfront about this. As I say, you can see the cost to their economy. Last night, the UK government released modelling of how much it would cost. They didn't actually outline the costs, but they did release modelling on the impact of pursuing a net-zero agenda. I give them credit for that. That modelling showed that, to reach net-zero emissions, you would need a carbon price of A$295 a tonne. That is outrageous. That will put a wrecking ball through any economy. If you put $300 a tonne on people's power bills, on people's petrol costs and on farmers' methane emissions and shut down our cattle industry, that is going to be an economic disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also revealed that there would be a fiscal shortfall thanks to net zero as well because taxes on a variety of things would fall. That would leave them 1.5 per cent of GDP short. If that was in Australia, you would have a $1,000-a-year impact on Australia wages. It would mean we would have to put up taxes just to offset the fiscal impact, let alone the power bills and petrol costs. Just the fiscal impact would be an extra $1,000 a year. That is the disaster that net-zero emissions are spreading through the world in any country that is trying to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What you won't hear in the mainstream press is that just nine countries in the world have legislated net-zero emissions. The US can't get legislation through. Those include countries in Europe that are living through a disaster right now. Canada has legislated net-zero emissions but—guess what?—emissions this century in Canada have gone up. They had a reduction due to COVID last year, but until 2019 Canada's emissions had gone up under the Trudeau administration. You wouldn't realise that if you just listened to our mainstream press. In New Zealand, they have also legislated the net-zero emissions target. They have exempted their agriculture industry, which accounts for half of their emissions. What a joke! The rest of the world is not doing this thing. They are walking away from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are lagging behind the world. The rest of the world is building coal-fired power stations. We are not doing anything. We need to build these modern, clean, coal-fired power stations, just like the rest of the world is. Four countries that have signed up to net zero are building, combined, 129 coal-fired power stations. China is committed to net zero, apparently. We are told they are committed. And, of course, I believe the Chinese Communist Party; they never lie! They are building 95 coal-fired power stations right now. Indonesia have also apparently signed up to net-zero emissions. Between us and them, we are the first and second biggest coal exporters. They sometimes get the top prize. They have committed to net-zero emissions, apparently. They are building 23 coal-fired power stations. Japan is building seven coal-fired power stations even though we are told, 'They're not going to buy our coal anymore.' They are building coal-fired power stations now. Korea is building four. Demand for Australian coal has never been stronger, and it is going to keep growing for years to come. We as a nation should take that opportunity. We should be building more mines so that we can meet this demand and bring more people out of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest environmental issue in the world is not carbon emissions. It is air pollution in our region. It kills four million people a year. What we should do to help avoid those deaths is provide reliable electricity that does not create the smog and ash that causes these deaths. Our coal industry does that because it helps electrify countries and remove them from the use of organic matter that causes these deaths. To fix the environment we should be building more Australian coalmines today.</span>

                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western</span><span class="HPS-Electorate"> Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  Well, clearly we have in Senator Canavan a man who has the courage of his convictions—so much so that he's prepared to hold the whole government hostage in his race to get what he wants in his unscientific version of what is in the national interest. But there is no doubt that we are in a very real race across the globe to act to the benefit of both our environment and the economy. Leaving it—as some would argue and as this government wants to do, it seems—to 2049 to decide how you're going to get there means funeral bells for both our environment and our economy. 'Let's do this with technology,' they say. They haven't given any kind of indication of the framework under which industries will need to lower emissions in order for us to reach any such goal. Happily, federal Labor is well underway in planning a more ambitious medium-term emissions reduction target than the coalition, as well as committing to net-zero emissions by 2050. We know that a net-zero target by 2050 is not nearly sufficient. Targets have to be backed by policies and mechanisms that deliver the promised abatement that we need to get to that point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, as we move towards renewable energy and move to lower the carbon intensity of our economy, that good climate policy is also good jobs policy. It's all very well for Senator Canavan to bemoan, from his point of view, the lack of stability and the level of income that might be attached to such jobs. The simple fact is that this is a government that undermines the industrial relations system and people's ability to get good wages in new industries. It's only the established industries with long histories of unionism where we have such well-protected working conditions. So the real challenge here is to enable our economy and those jobs to transition so that we have those productive and well-paid jobs of the future. We also know that regional and rural areas are the centre of the new jobs in a new climate future and a new energy future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't need to be told by the Australian Greens about the urgency of this problem and the need to act now, but I don't mind backing the Greens up in their message to the government, which is that we need to get on with our transition. We don't need to be told that Australia's climate policy doesn't matter because we only represent a small share of global emissions. We know that we are one of the highest per capita emitters in the world, and I think my own home state of Western Australia is perhaps the highest. We know the livelihoods that are damaged by climate change, including in farming communities, as weather patterns change, as bushfires rage through and as extreme weather events take their toll on agricultural production, tourism, infrastructure and so much more—livelihoods in the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia should be in a position where we're able to persuade others on the world stage to take stronger action on climate change. To be credible, we must have our own house in order. The decarbonisation of the global economy is indeed the greatest economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. We've heard in recent weeks from the Business Council, the ACTU, the Conservation Foundation and the WWF, who have asserted that there are 395,000 clean-energy jobs that could be created by 2040. In fact, the likes of the ACTU, the ACF, the WWF and business have been banging on about this for a decade or so now. The proof is in the pudding. There are already real jobs in these sectors, but we have a government that's holding us back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every minute, every day, every year and every term of this government has cost us jobs, brought forth more emissions and held us back. We know that the environmental and economic transformation of the energy systems in our nation will take time. The longer we leave it, the less of an advantage we have and the harder it will be. We need to take responsibility and invest in the opportunities we have right before us before we have trade sanctions against us, before people don't want to take our exports because of our nation's emissions profile. There are so many scenarios that this government refuses to recognise, some of which are already in play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone from Western Australia, I know what an energy intensive and successful economy looks like. It's an economy that this country currently depends on to get through COVID, but in WA we know we have to adapt. We have a bright future ahead in renewables, but will we be able to build those markets as a nation with the kind of leadership we are seeing here now? Perhaps we'll be subject to trade sanctions. Perhaps the world won't be able to accept our gas or our clean energy and hydrogen, because we'll be a pariah on the world stage for our lack of action. We can't stick our heads in the sand the way the National Party wants us to do. The rest of the world might not always want our gas and our coal, despite what Senator Canavan says. This is bad news for both the economy and the environment. I truly wish we had a better head start in adjusting our economy even now. We've already seen right here in Australia that green energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't help coalmining communities to put Australia behind in the race towards climate action. It will simply make their situation worse. We know there are well-paid jobs for our communities, but we can't deliver them if we keep doing what we are doing, if we don't change, if we keep producing coal and fossil fuels until we can't, because we're forced to stop, without a plan to transition. We already have people expressing concern about simple things, important things like accumulated leave entitlements. What happens to them if the coal or gas company they work for becomes a stranded asset? What happens if we have houses that aren't worth anything because there's no job in that community? This is the kind of future that the likes of Senator Canavan would have us look towards. But we know we can do better than this. Australian communities know that a clean energy and a renewable future is inevitable. The sooner we act, the more we reduce the cost of action—acting sooner, rather than later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not against using technology to help our economy transition, but we have to have a real framework to get us there. This government haven't given us any. They've been there for eight years, and we still do not have a plan for climate action. Even now, at the eleventh hour, when Prime Minister Morrison is finally able to say, 'Yes, I'll go to Glasgow and to the international meetings,' we're yet to see whether the National Party will continue to hold the government, our nation and our whole economy to ransom. It has been eight years, and we still don't have a plan. But is it any wonder why, when we look at the nature of the debate we've had in the chamber today and listen to the likes of Senator Canavan decry a carbon restraint future? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on today's matter of urgency. This week the Prime Minister has made it clear that the coalition won't take 2030 targets to Glasgow, so don't be fooled by the coalition's sudden interest in those 2050 net zero targets. It's all smoke and mirrors. Net zero by 2050 is too late and, worst of all, it's based on expanding coal and gas. Just this month in my home state of Western Australia—and also don't be fooled by the two Labor senators who have left the chamber who have already spoken about the 'wonderful' Labor government in my home state—an exemption was granted to a Texan company called Black Mountain to drill for gas in the Kimberley. This is despite the government having announced an onshore gas export ban in August 2020. What's the point in having a ban on gas exports if the government can just go ahead and overturn it and approve them anyway? It's estimated that fracking in the Canning Basin alone could release 13.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent gases into the atmosphere. Australia's emissions budget is compatible with the Paris Agreement, which is only 5.5 billion tonnes of CO2e, which is three times that, just for the maths. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when we should be dramatically reducing emissions, it's unbelievable that the McGowan government is giving the green light to new gas developments in Western Australia. The community don't want fracking in the Kimberley. The traditional owners are sending me messages saying, 'We do not want fracking in the Kimberley.' No-one in this community has invited gas companies into their region. Fracking poses a risk to the health of the waterways, our land, our country. The damage it will cause the Kimberley will be absolutely horrific. And to what end? So we can wreck the planet and line the pockets of billionaires? As we move closer to the point of no return on climate change, we need urgent action and leadership from all Australian governments and all sides of politics. Although people in this chamber will argue, the science is clear: a safer climate means no coal and gas, and they must go. We need formally legislated 2030 targets of 75 per cent, and we need a plan to phase out coal and gas, starting today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Action on climate change won't hurt our economy, contrary to what others have said. In the UK, emissions have plummeted by 40 per cent since 1990, while their economy has doubled in size. The UK have a population three times the size of Australia's, and yet they make only two-thirds of the emissions that we do. A clean energy revolution will create hundreds of thousands of well-paid, long-term jobs, enabling workers in fossil fuel industries to transition. To unlock this revolution, the government must lead the way with a public investment in renewable generation, storage and transforming the power grid. WA has the opportunity to be a powerhouse for renewable energy. Now is the time to start planning for a just transition, in partnership with communities, so we can harness this opportunity. Even the Nationals leader in Western Australia, Mia Davies, has talked, only nine days ago, about committing to those targets. We have Victoria and the National Farmers Federation talking about these targets and committing to those targets, alongside the Minerals Council of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week thousands of young people across the nation participated in the School Strike 4 Climate. I joined hundreds of those young people at the front of Parliament House in Perth, talking about and taking part in that collective action. Using their voice to demand change, young people are the next generation of decision-makers and leaders, and they are our inspiration and our hope. So let's work together to kick out the Liberals at the next election, alongside the Nationals. With the Greens in shared power, we'll be able to push the next government further and faster on climate action.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THORPE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of urgency today, because we would not be here, with a cooking planet and rising seas, if you fellas cared for country the way we have always done. You fellas brought this mess here, right! We looked after these lands for thousands and thousands of generations. And then what happens? The boats roll in and it's, 'Let's dig up as much as we can and destroy as much as we can and make as much money as we can, because money's going to save our lives, at the end of the day, and it's going to give us oxygen'—right?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These big problems that have been caused by burning dirty, dirty fossil fuels need big solutions—solutions that our people, the true experts, First Nations people, the oldest continuing living culture in the world—right here. Right here, right now you've got two of us. We've been here forever. We know how to look after the land. We didn't dig the coal. We didn't frack the gas. In blackfella way, you don't do that. You don't pull the heart out of your mother's chest. You don't pull the eyes out of your kid's head. Yes, it's horrible to think of that, but that's what is going on in our mother land, in our Mother Earth. There are resources being extracted that are equivalent to pulling your mother's heart out of her chest, or your kid's eyes out of their head. The mother is alive—our mother is alive—and every time you dig for coal or dig for gas, that is exactly what you're doing. Our mother is, to us, alive as a person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our law and our moral legal kinship and ethical obligations to country are older than your Magna Carta. To solve the climate crisis, we need to give country back its personhood. And this week I promise the Green's solution to care for country, which is to give personhood status to the environment. That's one way of solving the climate crisis. Environmental personhood is about giving the environment, or parts of the environment—like our rivers, lakes, forests and oceans—the rights, protections, privileges and responsibilities that actual people have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For our people, we are no different to the environment. We don't see ourselves as different from the lakes and the rivers, the animals and the sky. We are them, and they are us. This is why giving the environment personhood is a solution that we must urgently adopt. This is not a new idea, despite some legal professors trying to pass the idea off as their own—as they do; this is how we've always done it for thousands of generations. And if corporations—the word literally means 'to have a body'—which actually only exist on paper, can have personhood, why can't our environment?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, granting personhood to nature is a moment that isn't being led by academics or lawyers. Who's it being led by? It's being led by indigenous people all around the world. In 2014 Te Urewera, a beautiful forested area in the North Island, in Aotearoa, was given legal personhood. It owns land in its own right. It is also a special place for our Maori family, and I honour and salute them in the right to protect their country. The Whanganui River in Aotearoa was declared a legal person in 2017. The river is recognised as an individual, living whole from the mountains to the sea, incorporating the physical, spiritual and metaphysical environment. We need to do it, and we need to do it now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This body, the Office of the Special Investigator, has been established to 'thoroughly and independently address the alleged criminal offences which fall within our remit'—that is, war crimes in Afghanistan. As my colleague Senator Steele-John said in November:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is alleged on the public record that innocent people have lost their lives at the hands of Australian soldiers; the individuals responsible must lose more than just their medals and the Australian people must know to what extent those allegations are true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the sad truth is that, beyond the war crimes that we've heard reports of, we need a much more honest accounting with the Australian public, and that goes to both Australia's role in the invasion of Afghanistan and Australia's response to the collapse. ustralia invaded Afghanistan in support of the US and as part of a coalition. As my former colleague Scott Ludlam pointed out, if the goal was to align ourselves closely with the US, we have succeeded. We have seen more of that since, with our buying into the AUKUS alliance and the critiques that have come from all quarters on that move. But, if the goal was to stabilise the country or the region, we have failed. And not only that but the coalition forces killed thousands of Afghans. The figures are difficult to compile and even harder to comprehend. One estimate based on UN figures suggests that between 2006 and 2020 there were 3,610 civilian casualties killed by international air forces in Afghanistan. That is merely part of a broader estimate of total civilian casualties killed by pro-government forces—8,617 killed tween 2009 and 2020. It's no wonder that we failed to stabilise the country. It's no wonder that the result was the Taliban invading again. All the while, Australia has denied asylum to Afghan people seeking refuge. We have turned away people at our borders and used cruel, heartless detention policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as the questions that have to be answered about Australia's invasion, we need answers to the Australian government's actions in the months leading up to the collapse of Kabul. We know from public information that the Australian government expected Kabul to fall to the Taliban months before it happened. At the same time, there was a chaotic, turbulent process for people seeking to leave Afghanistan, including people who had worked with the Australian government, such as interpreters. We heard the tragic news this morning that an Afghan interpreter who had worked with the Australian forces was murdered by the Taliban. He was killed. This is the fate of people who worked with our forces who have been left behind. This is their fate at the moment. Yes, during the weeks after the fall of Kabul we got 4,000 people out. But, for those who are left behind, the situation is tragic and the outlook is so bleak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share just one story with you sent to me a few days ago—one story from the thousands of stories that our Greens offices have received over the past month. This is from an Australian citizen whose wife is trapped in Kabul. In his letter, he told me how the Taliban has been going house to house in Kabul, hunting for his family because they are Hazara Shia people. His wife was an educator of young girls and his father-in-law was a community leader who spoke out against the Taliban's crimes. This person, this Australian citizen, has applied for visas. He has emailed and called upon our government and governments all around the world. He is desperate. His wife is desperate. Their whole family is desperate. But there's been nothing. He cannot even get his wife an emergency humanitarian visa from our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that since the airlift finished there have been so very few people that the Australian government has supported to get over the borders. We know that the Australian government can do more. It must start with committing to a special intake of at least 20,000 refugees. It's the least we can do. We invaded Afghanistan. We are part of the problem that is now there. The very least we can do is accept a special intake of at least 20,000 refugees, at least matching the actions of other governments around the world. We need to be providing genuine support for those people. It's the least that the Australian government must and should be doing.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South </span><span class="HPS-Electorate">Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  On behalf of the chair, I present the final report of the Select Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre together with accompanying documents. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you for the opportunity to make a few remarks about this important report. This select committee was kicked off late in 2019 with a mandate to look at financial technology and regulatory technology. It has delivered already two reports with recommendations which have in large part been adopted and implemented. The whole point of having a parliamentary review of these issues is to ensure that Australians can be availed of the latest and greatest choice and opportunities of financial innovation, in particular, but also that we are appraised and aware of all the consumer protection needs which come with those technological developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this final report, which is amongst the first parliamentary reports into cryptocurrency or digital assets anywhere around the world, this is a matter of interest to many Australians. One in five Australians already has cryptocurrency, and this is a particular phenomenon which skews to younger people. Younger people are interested in digital assets and cryptocurrency, because it provides them with agency and control that wasn't available to prior generations. I think, at the end of the day when you pare it all back, we want people, we want Australians, to have access to the best ideas, the best new options, the most choice, the most agency and the lowest prices. We don't want people to be dependent upon great big institutions like banks. We want people to be able to become the master of their own domain to the greatest extent possible, and that is what I think cryptocurrency and digital assets offer Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a great dividend to the country if we can become a digital asset or a cryptohub, and that is of course more investment and more jobs. I have to say I've been blown away by the number of people who are working in cryptocurrency in Australia already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also concerned about the capital and brain drain that we are facing because of a lack of regulation and a lack of sophistication in this space. The fact is that Australian businesses and Australian capital are going to jurisdictions like the UK, the US and Singapore because they have a better regulatory system. When I talk about a better regulatory system, what I'm talking about is two key principles. The first principle is that we want to protect consumers. We already have a system of significant financial regulation, but cryptocurrency—which, as I say, is owned by one in five Australians—is largely unregulated. So we want to make sure that we protect consumers, but we also want to make sure that Australia is getting that investment which is going to drive dynamism and drive the options and the choice so that people can get away from the big banks if they want to or can get a lower price on international money transfers to their family in another country. The agency and the choice, I think, are very important here in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report delivers a suite of recommendations on cryptocurrency. We have recommended the creation of a licensing system for crypto markets. We have recommended a licensing system for custody and depository systems. We have recommended a new company structure known as a DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation. So we have recommended some significant corporate law changes. We've recommended these changes because we felt that there was a lack of regulation and a lack of certainty which could do a combination of things: it could hurt consumers, but it could also drive down investment in Australian cryptocurrency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also decided to make recommendations to improve the tax competitiveness of Australian cryptocurrency. We have recommended changes to the capital gains tax regime so that capital gains tax occurs only if there is a genuinely definable capital gain or loss. It has come to the committee's attention that the way the CGT regime operates could actually be damaging new products and new innovation in Australia because of the tax arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also suggested that companies which are engaged in digital mining should be eligible for a company tax discount if they source renewable energy of their own making. That is, of course, a reflection of the fact that I don't think the Australian people would support burning up the grid and burning up fossil fuels to underpin bitcoin or other cryptocurrency mining. Also, we do need to significantly increase our investment in renewable energy if we are to decarbonise the electricity grid. We have made great progress in developing solar and wind. Just in the past few weeks, the Senate has considered a bill to facilitate offshore wind. But the ongoing investment into renewable energy will be critical for Australia to realise our net-zero ambitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also made some significant recommendations in relation to a phenomenon known as debanking, and this has been a major issue in the committee's deliberations. Basically, the issue is that people who have been involved in fintech or cryptocurrency have found it very hard to get a bank account, and if you can't get a bank account it's very hard to be in an innovative country, because that is the basis for so many things that you need to be able to do. Some people have been debanked 90 times, and there's been a merry-go-round of small businesses and large businesses which have been debanked just because of the business that they are in, which in many parts is actually a legal business and has been semi-regulated by AUSTRAC under their digital currency exchange regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in summary, this is an agenda for Australian leadership in cryptocurrency. It would put Australia at the top of the list of countries with a sophisticated regulatory framework—one that can drive those benefits to consumers but also one that can attract investment on shore. But, unless we address the issues of debanking, we face a major brain drain and a major capital drain. The solutions we put forward in the committee's report don't seek to force banks to finance any particular person or any particular company. We wouldn't force a bank to finance a coalmine and we wouldn't force a bank to finance a digital miner. These are liberal solutions in the form of more disclosure but also in terms of forcing the Australian Financial Complaints Authority to have a role here in this space. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I have a couple of points about the process. This has been a process which has garnered huge attention—more than 100 submissions in just this past six months, public hearings and a huge amount of interest from the cryptocurrency community and beyond. These are bipartisan recommendations, so I would like to place on record my thanks to Senator Marielle Smith, who did a terrific job in being deputy chair of this committee over the most part of two years. I also want to thank the other members of the committee and offer my thanks to Lyn Beverley and CJ Sautelle of the secretariat, who've worked extremely hard with a very difficult chairperson, at times! The product of their work is very, very good. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is a good example of the parliament going into places where it perhaps doesn't always go, and I think that there were probably some words put into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> which probably haven't be seen before and probably shouldn't be seen again. But I do think that one of the problems we have is that we are a long way away from the market in general, as a parliament—and I use that term in the broadest sense. In this place, in relation to these issues, we are a very, very long way away from the dynamism and the rapid pace of innovation. So we have tried to listen and tried to respond with a plan that would put consumers first, but we've also tried to maximise the opportunities for Australia to capture this innovation, which is irresistible, hugely disruptive and full of opportunities for our country. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  [by video link] Today I also speak on the final report of the Select Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre Committee. This report provides the committee's findings for its third inquiry into the financial technology and regulatory technology sectors in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I speak to the work of this committee and to this report, I want to start by thanking the chair, Senator Bragg. We have worked well together, I believe. We have found plenty of agreement—probably we've found more disagreement—but I've enjoyed the process and I've enjoyed working with Senator Bragg. I also thank the other members of the committee for their participation in our hearings and deliberations, and the wonderful committee secretariat, particularly Ms Lyn Beverley and Mr CJ Sautelle, who have provided what has been absolutely world-class support to participating senators and their staff. I, for one, have very much appreciated their wisdom, their advice and the support they have provided to the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first inquiry of this committee sought to investigate the barriers and challenges that Australian fintechs and regtechs are trying to overcome in attempts to grow their enterprises, grow the sector and grow their respective industries. We have identified many challenges that Australian startup fintechs and regtechs are confronting, which have only worsened during the pandemic. In fact, these developments and the economic crisis that has ensued encouraged the committee to resolve to bring forward the tabling of that interim report, so it could immediately deal with COVID related topics, as well as dealing with other evidence that had been provided to the inquiry at that point in time. While there wasn't unanimous agreement for everything in that first interim report, there was much we could agree on, and it provided a solid base for our committee to conduct its following two inquiries. On that note, I would like to pass on a word of thanks to Senator Kitching, who took over from me as deputy chair and oversaw the passage of that second interim report while I welcomed my daughter into the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This current report finalised a lot of the work the committee wanted to include in the first report but couldn't because of the need to expediate that first interim report's release in response to the pandemic. Although that report was brought to the Senate by a committee under a different name and terms of reference, the work is relevant here. We expanded the terms of reference of this committee to allow for a broader examination of the fintech sectors here in Australia, and that's where this report comes to today. The major focus of the report was investigation of the policy environment surrounding the cryptocurrency sector in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is obviously a huge area of interest for Australians. We've heard and received evidence about the increasing uptake of crypto-assets by everyday Australians, and I note this is especially the case for younger Australians. We heard from stakeholders about why this interest necessitates greater regulatory intervention in the crypto-asset sector to drive further growth and establish Australia as a global leader in financial technology. Most people these days know about bitcoin, but this is just one of the many crypto-offerings out there that are presenting new and ever-evolving challenges and opportunities that countries all over the world are grappling with. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that this report serves as a point to promote greater discussion about this growing sector and how critical it is that as a parliament we ensure that any reform has the best interests of everyday Australian investors and consumers at its heart, that these interests are protected and that we are always thinking about Australians making these investment decisions and making sure that our laws and regulations reflect their needs and interests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor senators provided additional comments to this report which speak to this issue. I note that Senator Bragg said this is a bipartisan report. I'm not sure that's quite true. We have provided additional comments which speak to some of our concerns and some of our policy areas of interest, which I would point to as well. I won't go through them in detail because they're there in the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the proceedings of this committee inquiry, I've been mindful of the need to balance the desire to encourage growth in the fintech and regtech sectors and protecting the needs of consumers and other Australians. Upon the tabling of the first interim report, I noted the responsibility that our government has to ensure, in particular, that the financial literacy needs of Australians are keeping up with the availability of more financial products. This was an ongoing theme throughout all of our inquiries, whether we were talking about buy-now pay-later products, digital finance or cryptocurrency investments. It remains an issue in Australia, and I would like to see more funding and more support for financial literacy so that we can make sure that consumers are protected, that they have the education they're seeking and that these organisations, which provide fantastic services for Australians, are able to support consumers as they need to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence at all of our hearings suggested that there aren't nearly enough educational tools available for Australians to better understand the digitalised financial products they are seeking to use or invest in. As I've stated previously, not addressing this new phenomenon will only further widen the digital divide that we know exists in our community between those who have access to or an understanding of these technologies, how to benefit from them, use them and apply them, and those who don't. This will only serve to further disenfranchise vulnerable groups in our community who feel shut out of this digital divide. I believe the true opportunity, the true potential, of fintech and regtech will only be fulfilled if their availability results in a narrowing of the digital divide in Australia and brings more people into the fold of being able to participate in those technologies and participate in technology more broadly. To do this, they need access, they need education and we need to make sure that these products are accessible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude my remarks by thanking all the various stakeholders who have participated over the three reports, particularly those who have invited me to see their operations, to visit their businesses and to brief me, whether it was in person or remotely, as the pandemic set in. I've absolutely loved meeting you, talking to you, learning more about your industry and learning about the reform challenge we have ahead of us in Australia to make sure your industry can grow and flourish and to make sure that consumers engaging with your industry are protected and have the right educational tools at their disposal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our work as a committee has only been possible because of the evidence that stakeholders provided to us. They often did this through a considerable donation of their time and energy and resources. Many of the people who submitted to this inquiry and came to our hearings had never participated in a Senate process before. I want to thank them for the care and attention they put into their submissions, for taking the time to speak to us in these hearings and also for taking the time to offer personal briefings to make sure that we all had the information we needed as we were considering our inquiry and getting to our report. So thank you for that. In particular, thank you to the South Australian fintechs. I think there's a very promising future for fintech and regtech in our state of South Australia, and I look forward to working with you all to ensure that you have that opportunity to grow your businesses and you are supported by Australian regulation in order to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there is so much more that the fintech and regtech sectors will offer over the years to come. I just want to say that in me you have found an admiring ally and an advocate. I look forward to working with you in the future. Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this report. I want to highlight the additional comments from Labor senators reflecting our position and again thank everyone who has been involved in the inquiry for their work and support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  [by video link] The work that has been done by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme as it has considered its report into the government's so-called independent assessments proposal has been, I think, some of the most important work done by a parliamentary committee in recent times. It was a very long and thorough investigation that benefited tremendously from bringing in the voices and experiences of disabled people across our community and, indeed, across our country as we analysed and examined in detail the proposals and assumptions being put to us as a committee in relation to one of the most significant changes in the NDIS's history. In fact, I would argue it is the most significant proposed change to the NDIS since its creation nearly 10 years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just recap what was being put to us as a committee. We were asked to explore a proposal, placed in front of us by the government, that spoke to a plan, which had been formulated, that in many ways constituted a fundamental change to key aspects of the scheme and key principles upon which the scheme was founded. The NDIS was created to ensure that disabled people are able to get access to the supports and services that we need to live our lives just like everybody else, and those supports are to be guided by the key elements of our lived experience, the information and evidence provided by our trusted healthcare and support professionals and the goals that we have set, as disabled people, as participants in the scheme within the plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal put before us by the government was one where those principles would be undermined and shifted so that, instead, the amount of money that you receive, the amount of money that is allocated in your plan, would be determined based on the outcome of an assessment by a so-called independent assessor, who would be somebody whom you have never met, somebody whom you may not meet in person, somebody who may have no relevant experience, no prior experience with you and no relevant expertise in relation to the disability or impairment that you have. Based on their singular assessment, information would be fed into a so-called budgeting tool that would then result in a pot of money with which you would have to make do and mend as a disabled person. It was a disastrous idea, one which was opposed from the very beginning by disabled people. It was in that context that we began our investigation. All these many months later, I'd like to draw the Senate's attention to some key aspects of what we, as a committee, discovered through the process of our investigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, I think it's probably evident to many people that, in putting forward this proposal, the government and the NDIA demonstrated a complete institutional failure to consult and engage with disabled people on nearly every aspect and element and moment in the creation process. The design, the trialling and the attempted implementation of this policy were completely out of touch with what the community expected or needed. The outcome of this failure of a process was the causing of great distress to thousands of disabled people across the country. Basically, after spending as much time as we did as an inquiry looking into this proposal, it seemed pretty clear that the government was attempting to shift the result of its own mismanagement of the NDIA—the result of the failure to lift the staffing cap, the result of poor training among planners and officials provided by the agency and the result of directives, implicit or explicit, to reduce plans. All of these things were coming together to create an NDIS experience that was bad for people. The result of that was then attempted to be shifted onto the participants themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has to be noted that, through the course of the inquiry, we, as a committee, were presented with a picture of an inquiry of an agency that was almost institutionally unwilling to be open, transparent and accountable to the people that it serves. It became very clear that, instead of genuinely engaging with and codesigning the biggest reform in the scheme's history, the NDIA and the government took a forceful top-down approach that not only wouldn't work, but would also go on to exacerbate existing inequalities within the scheme and force people to be subject to deeply inappropriate and unsafe assessment processes. Not only was the proposed assessment process and the tools selected for it rejected and opposed by disabled people and their families, but it was seriously scrutinised and rightly critiqued by the very sector expected to pick up this workload, the allied health profession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard evidence from the community that spoke to the inequalities experienced by people accessing the NDIS or attempting to access supports for the NDIS. Importantly, we heard very clearly the connection that was being drawn between these experiences and the solutions that were proposed as being solutions by the government. The oversimplified, to the point of being wrong, approach that the government took when designing this policy fix relied on deeply flawed data that reduced the diversity of people's experiences within the NDIS, the average statistics that poorly reflected the reality of the lives of the people within the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are big balances to overcome to ensure that the scheme is equitable, but at no point throughout the process was the government's proposed solution the obvious and logical answer. In fact, it was found to be the antithesis of progress in the scheme. The crux of the evidence we heard and the findings made throughout the inquiry can be boiled down to a very simple message: disabled people led the push for the creation of the NDIS, disabled people are the experts who understand how the scheme should operate and disabled people are the ones who should lead any reform process that occurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before concluding, I will bring the Senate's attention to a very concise diagram created by the committee to illustrate the differences between how the agency and the government approached this process of reform versus how they should have done. It is listed, I think, in chapter 4. We laid out very clearly that a proper policy design process for the NDIS should involve a process by which we go first to policy design, then to extensive consultation, then to revised policy design, then to trials and pilots, then to revised policy design and finally through to the announcement of the decision. This logical co-design based process stands in direct contrast to what the agency and the government ended up doing, which was to design a policy, make an announcement in relation to the decision that the said policy would go ahead, implement trials, then consult on the results of those trials, followed by a kind of surface redesign, which ended up with the proposal being dropped. The result of this broken policy creation process was that many disabled people during one of the most stressful periods of recent years for us, going through the COVID-19 pandemic, also had to fear what would be next in relation to our NDIS, whether we would keep the supports that we so desperately need. This must never happen again, and as we move forward with the NDIS, we must cling to the principle of 'nothing about us without us'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government welcomes both the reports of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (PJCCFS), and the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC), on class actions and litigation funding. The Government is committed to ensuring that class members receive a fair and equitable outcomes from class actions, including those supported by a litigation funder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Integrity, Fairness, and Efficiency: An Inquiry into Class Actions Proceedings and Third-Party Lit</span><span style="font-style:italic;">igation Funders, </span>was tabled in Parliament in January 2019. Its terms of reference required the ALRC to consider whether, and to what extent, class action proceedings and third party litigation funders should be subject to Commonwealth regulation. In particular, the ALRC was directed to consider key issues going to the fairness and efficacy of Australia's class actions and third party litigation funding regimes, including costs, conflicts of interests, the distribution of proceeds and prudential requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The report highlighted the need for a range of changes to the class action framework to keep pace with evolutionary developments in this legal market. The Government carefully considered the complex issues raised in the ALRC report, and considered the best way to ensure that Government reforms account for continuing developments in the commercial and legal environment following the release of the ALRC report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government subsequently moved to refer an inquiry to the PJCCFS to further scrutinise the class action regime and the litigation funding industry. The Committee's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Litigation funding and the regulation of the class action industry, </span>was tabled in December 2020. The Government considered that the inquiry would provide an avenue to further test and refine the ALRC's recommendations, while providing an additional evidence base for legislative changes. In particular, the Government recognised the need for greater scrutiny of the impact that litigation funders' business models have on justice outcomes for class members, as well as on the Australian economy in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This included consideration of:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the reasons for the unprecedented growth in the number of class actions in Australia, including to what extent this owed to the increasing presence of litigation funders</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the rates of return to litigation funders and whether their significant profits were coming unjustly at the expense of the ordinary Australians, who join class actions seeking fair compensation for an injury or loss</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">whether the regulatory framework for litigation funding remained fit-for-purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and the ALRC have affirmed the importance and value of class actions. The class action regime, when working as originally intended, enables groups of people to pursue redress more cheaply and efficiently than would otherwise be the case, and helps discourage wrongdoing. Additionally class actions promote the efficient and effective use of court resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, the reports also highlight a number of reform priorities to ensure that class actions continue to operate in the best interests of Australians. These will form the building blocks of the Government's reform package for class actions and the litigation funding industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also had regard to matters before the courts that clearly highlight many of the issues addressed by the PJCCFS and ALRC reports about litigation funding practices. Notably, this</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">includes the class action against Banksia Securities Limited (Banksia) brought by Laurence John Bolitho on behalf of Banksia Debenture holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes the recent decision of the Honourable Justice John Dixon in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Banksia </span>case and considers it to be a 'wake-up' call for the litigation funding industry and legal profession. The Government notes, in particular, the findings that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a litigation funder and five lawyers ('contraveners') engaged in "egregious conduct" in connection with a "fraudulent scheme", intending to claim more than $19 million <span style="font-style:italic;">in </span>purported legal costs and funding commission from the settlement sum in a group proceeding</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the contravener's conduct had "shattered...confidence" in "expectations of lawyers as an honourable profession", and "corrupted the proper administration of justice"</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the contraveners' actions constituted "appalling" breaches of their respective duties to the court, particularly the paramount duty to the court and overarching obligations imposed on them by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Civil Procedure Act 2010 </span>(Vic)</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the contraveners should pay damages of $11,700,128 to approximately 16,000 group members, plus the costs of the remitter on an indemnity basis.<span style="font-style:italic;">[1]</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has already taken action, and will continue to take action, to address these concerning litigation funding practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By bringing litigation funders within the scope of the Corporations Act, the Government's amendment of the Corporations Regulations in 2020 enhanced the oversight and enforcement powers available to ASIC with respect to litigation funding schemes. The amendments also imposed fiduciary and statutory duties on the Responsible Entity of litigation funding schemes which fall under the definition of MISs in the Corporations Act. The Government has also consulted through exposure draft legislation, on changes which would further constrain litigation funder impropriety in class actions, and enhance protections against the circumstances arising in the Banksia class action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If progressed, the reform package under consideration by the Government could achieve a number of key objectives. First, the Government will consider reforms to ensure that Australians get a fair and proportionate share of any judgment or settlement sum resulting from class actions. A critical finding of the PJCCFS majority report was that the return to litigation funders from supporting a class action is often disproportionate to their costs and risks. In particular, the majority report highlighted that the practice of percentage-based billing enables windfall profits to be obtained. Similarly, the ALRC's report found that when litigation funders were involved in a class action, the median return to class members was just 51 per cent, compared to 85 per cent when a funder was not involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These findings are consistent with the judgments of the courts that have drawn attention to the fact that class members can receive unreasonably low proportions of judgment or settlement sums once litigation funding commissions and legal costs are deducted. It is reasonable that litigation funders and lawyers make a profit to ensure the sustainability of their businesses (which in turn safeguards access to justice). However, such a state of affairs runs counter to the compensatory nature of the class actions system, which is primarily designed to vindicate the rights of class members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government therefore conducted further consultation on how best to guarantee a statutory minimum return of the gross proceeds of a class action, as recommended by the PJCCFS. This consultation occurred between 1 and 28 June 2021 and received 23 submissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1 <span style="font-style:italic;">Bolitho v Banksia Securities Ltd (No 18} (remitter) </span>(2021] VSC 666</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Having regard to the outcomes of the consultation, the Government is considering a reform to ensure that class members who are members of a class action litigation funding scheme will receive a fair and reasonable proportion of the gross proceeds of a class action. It has consulted on this measure through exposure draft legislation. Notably, the exposure draft legislation included a proposed rebuttable presumption that the return to members of the litigation funding scheme must be 70 per cent of the gross proceeds in order for the distribution of proceeds to meet this threshold. This would provide a clear signal that the community expects that the primary purpose of the class action regime is to vindicate the rights of ordinary Australians. At the same time, the flexibility of the Court to do justice in a particular matter would be preserved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This exposure draft legislation also sought views on how Government could best enhance court oversight and ability to intervene in the terms of a litigation funding agreement, to ensure that justice can be done in a particular matter. This could include enhancing the role of referees and contradictors in testing the reasonableness of legal costs and litigation funding fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, the Government will consider opportunities to further enhance the systemic regulation of litigation funders. The Government welcomes the endorsement by the majority report of the PJFCCFS of the Government's decision to require litigation funders to hold an Australian Financial Service Licence (AFSL) and comply with the managed investment scheme (MIS) regime. Litigation funders had been exempted from these requirements by the previous Government. The Government removed these exemptions, which had the effect of:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">requiring litigation funders to act honestly, efficiently and fairly</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">requiring litigation funders to have the necessary competence and organisational resources to provide financial services</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">providing transparency around the operations of litigation funders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the PJCCFS majority report noted, the action taken by the Government has aligned the regulation of litigation funding in class actions with that which applies to other financial services. The Government is committed to continuously ensuring that regulation is fit-for-purpose. The Government also notes the concerns identified by the majority report in circumstances where lawyers conduct class actions on a contingency fee basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, the Government recognises that class action and litigation funding policy must have due regard to the imperatives of Australia's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted earlier, class actions rightfully play an important role in deterring corporate wrongdoing and providing a remedy where such wrongdoing has occurred. However, it is also important to ensure that economically inefficient class actions do not have a detrimental effect on business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government therefore temporarily amended the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Act 2001 </span>(Corporations Act), in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, so that companies and officers would only be liable for a breach of continuous disclosure obligations, if there is "knowledge, recklessness or negligence".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following the PJCCFS majority report endorsing this change, the Parliament permanently legislated this reform, which came into effect on 22 August 2021. The Government recognises that in a COVID- 19 context, the challenges of determining whether a given piece of information will have a material effect on the price or value of securities may increase the risk of opportunistic class actions. This change has provided companies and officers with greater confidence to provide guidance to the market at a time when such disclosures are even more important for investors and other stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fourth, the Government will introduce legislative changes to enhance the protective and supervisory role of the Federal Court. Both the PJCCFS majority report and the ALRC made several recommendations to that end. The Government recognises that these proposals will bolster the protection of class members, enhance judicial economy, and better align the Court's ability to regulate litigation funders with the significant impact that funders can have on matters before it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These enhancements to the Federal Court's powers are timely given that the growth in the involvement of litigation funders would not have been foreseen when the federal class action regime was enacted in 1992.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To strengthen the effectiveness of these recommendations, the Government is considering whether to progress a number of legislative changes through the Corporations Act. This will ensure that class members are protected, irrespective of which jurisdiction a matter is filed in, and prevent forum shopping to avoid these important protections for consumers. Fragmentation in class action regimes also poses a risk of competing class actions and impedes the development of a national class action jurisprudence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, as part of the Government's commitment to drive harmonisation in the class action regime, the Government will give further consideration to the majority report's recommendation that the Federal Court be conferred with exclusive jurisdiction for class action proceedings arising under the Corporations Act and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2001 </span>(ASIC Act).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to consult with stakeholders prior to implementing its reforms. It will also ensure that all necessary Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements are completed prior to the introduction of legislation or other implementation of its commitments in this Response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government extends its thanks to the Committee, and in particular to the Chair, Senator James Paterson, for ably leading the PJCCFS inquiry. Likewise, the Government thanks the ALRC, under the leadership of the ALRC President and Commissioner in Charge, the Hon Justice Sarah Derrington, for its report.</span>

Data cited by the PJCCFS indicated that 41.4 per cent of the gross settlement of funded class actions went to lawyers and litigation funders, across the period 2001 to 2020.<span style="font-style:italic;">[2]</span> The PJCCFS concluded that in many cases, litigation funders were obtaining windfall profits well in excess of the risks they were taking, at the expense of the class members' share of the proceeds. The PJCCFS noted that the incidence of such windfall profits were not restricted to isolated instances of illegal or egregious behaviour. Rather, there appeared to be a "systemic and inappropriate skewing of the proceeds of a successful class action".<span style="font-style:italic;">[3]</span> Even now, this problem remains prevalent, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Whi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ttenbury v Vocation Limited (in liquidation)4, </span>a decision handed down in 2021, the lawyers and funders together received nearly 50% of the settlement sum.</span>

The PJCCFS cited various examples where the Federal Court has intervened in class actions where it has deemed a funding commission to be excessive. This includes a matter where the Court reduced a funder's commission from 32 per cent to 25 per cent7 and another where the commission was reduced from 25 per cent to 8.3 per cent.<span style="font-style:italic;">[8]</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS considered that the use of percentage-based fees appeared to contribute significantly to the windfall returns achieved by litigation funders. It therefore recommended consideration be given to a range of alternative approaches including empirical analysis of past cases, percentage limits, sliding scales, investment and insurance risks-return principles, net present value estimates, and a guaranteed statutory minimum return of the gross proceeds of a class action.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC did not make similar recommendations specifically targeting the commissions of litigation funders. However, it did recommend that the Federal Court be given broad power to approve, vary or amend litigation funding agreements when the interests of justice require. This would enable the Federal Court to take an active role in the construction of the legal costs agreement and ensure proceedings advance upon fair and reasonable terms. It did not seek to prescribe statutory criteria to define the 'interests of justice'. Instead it recommended reliance on the Federal Court's existing and developing jurisprudence. The ALRC further recommended two particular aspects of any litigation funding agreement be prescribed in statute, that:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS agreed with these recommendations by the ALRC. It noted that increasing the Federal Court's supervisory and protective role in class actions would complement the recommendations for litigation funders to be managed under the AFSL and MIS regimes. The PJCCFS made further recommendations to bolster the use of referees as litigation funding fee assessors, with the possibility of costs being imposed on the ligation funder where their conduct justified this.</span>

The Government recognises the role played by litigation funders, among others, in ensuring access to justice, particularly in the class action system. At the same time, the evidence provided to the PJCCFS and ALRC highlight that far too often litigation funders are making profits that are disproportionate, when regard is had to the costs and risk they have undertaken. These undue profits come at the expense of class members whose legal rights a class action is meant to vindicate.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">[9]</span> Recommendation 20 of the PJCCFS report was that the Government consult on the best way of guarantee a statutory minimum return, whether such a return should be set at 70 per cent, and whether a graduated approach was appropriate. Consequently, the Treasurer and Attorney-General conducted a joint consultation process from 1 June to 28 June 2021. Twenty-three submissions were received from litigation funders, law firms, industry bodies and academics.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As both the PJCCFS and ALRC have noted, such measures would enable the Court to properly interrogate a litigation funding agreement. This recognises the significant impact that funders have on the conduct of a class action and ensures that the terms of an agreement are not unduly weighed in favour of the litigation funder, at the expense of the class. The Government considers that litigation funding agreements should only be approved by the Court if they are fair and reasonable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">then Government expressly excluded litigation funding schemes and arrangements from being credit facilities and made such schemes and arrangements financial products. It also explicitly exempted litigation funders from the requirement to hold an AFSL. To be exempt from holding an AFSL, the litigation funder had to maintain and follow practices for managing conflicts of interest that may arise during the duration of the litigation funding scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following this exemption, a broader range of litigation funding models emerged. These include: finance structured around a law firm, or department within a law firm, where the claimants are clients of the firm, as well as finance structured around a corporation claim holder or other entity which is likely to be involved in multiple legal disputes over a defined period of time.</span>

This led to a lack of clarity as to whether evolving forms of litigation funding are exempt from the definition of a MIS. In an effort to address this, the ALRC recommended that Regulation SC.11.01 of the Corporations Regulations be amended to include 'law firm financing' and 'portfolio funding' within the definition of a 'litigation funding scheme'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In May 2020, the Treasurer announced that class action litigation funding schemes would be subject to further regulatory oversight and that their exemption from the MIS and AFSL schemes would be removed. On 22 August 2020, regulations came into effect removing the exemption for third party class action litigation funders from compliance with the AFSL and MIS regimes under the Corporations Act if they intended to provide litigation funding in class actions in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and ALRC made recommendations to provide a clearer legislative basis for Common Fund Orders (CFOs), given the role they can play in supporting open class actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A CFO is an order made by the Court that requires all class members to equally contribute from their share of the settlement to the litigation funding costs. It permits a litigation funder to collect their commission from all class members in an open class, rather than just from those who had entered into a litigation funding agreement directly with the funder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS noted the uncertainty that currently exists regarding the legislative basis for a CFO. CFOs became a standard feature of the Australian class action regime following a 2016 decision in which the Full Court of the Federal Court held that it had the power to make a CFO at an early stage of a proceeding, under section 33ZF of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Feder</span><span style="font-style:italic;">al Court of Australia Act 1976 </span>(Federal Court Act).<span style="font-style:italic;">[11]</span> However, in 2019, the High Court of Australia held in <span style="font-style:italic;">BMW Australia Ltd v Brewster; Westpac Banking Corporation v Lentha</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ll </span><span style="font-style:italic;">[12]</span><span style="font-style:italic;">(Brewster)</span> that the Federal Court was not authorised to make such an order, under section 33ZF of the Federal Court Act, at an early stage of the proceeding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS noted that this decision has resulted in widespread confusion surrounding the Federal Court's ability to make a CFO, including at the settlement stage or following a judgment. It observed that such an order has been made under section 33V of the Federal Court Act in some matters. It also noted that the Federal Court had amended its Class Action Practice Note to provide that the parties may expect that a judge would, unless indicated to the contrary, make an appropriately framed order to equitably and fairly distribute the burden of reasonable legal costs, fees and other expenses, among all persons who have benefited from the action, where such an application is made and is fair, just, equitable and in accordance with principle. This would be particularly the case in an open class action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS recommended that the Government legislate to address any uncertainty, in accordance with the High Court's decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">Brewster.[13]</span> In doing so, it pointed to the impacts of the current uncertainty surrounding the availability of CFOs. It noted that this uncertainty can lead to increased costs. The PJCCFS identified that a lack of predictability of outcomes may deter litigation funders from funding class actions. It also observed that this may impact on competition in the Australian market and less beneficial funding terms for consumers. Further, the PJCCFS noted that this uncertainty may lead to procedural contests by either party to the litigation, leading to unnecessarily delayed proceedings and greater costs for class members.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reports found that CFOs encourage class actions to operate as open class actions. Open classes enable a common binding decision to apply to all with common claims without needing individuals to actively participate in the action. This promotes certainty and finality for defendants who are subject to common claims, unless a claimant has actively opted out of the class. The reports also pointed to arguments that CFOs can also enhance access to justice, especially for more vulnerable</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the context of open class actions, both reports found that CFOs avoid a "free-rider" problem. They do so by requiring <span style="font-style:italic;">all </span>class members who subsequently receive a benefit from any settlement of award in the action, to contribute to the expenses of a class action, including the litigation funder's commission. Both the PJCCFS and ALRC recognised that class members who have signed a funding agreement with the litigation funder should not be unfairly burdened with the cost of the litigation from which others benefit. Additionally, permitting the Federal Court to make CFOs was considered to have improved the Court's ability to amend and restrain funding commissions sought by funders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, a number of issues with CFOs were also identified. Notably, the availability of CFOs may promote a "race to the courts". Funders may commence an action prior to undertaking the necessary and appropriate investigation into a potential claim. Further, CFOs impose a litigation funding commission on class members who have not signed a litigation funding agreement. This is at odds generally with ensuring informed consent to fees and commissions, as well as the fundamental common law doctrine of 'privity of contract', where the rights and obligations of a contract are only extended to those who are party to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately the ALRC supported providing the Courts an express statutory power to make CFOs noting that the availability of CFOs is consistent with a number of the other recommendations in its report, including: that class actions be initiated as open class, that the court have an express statutory power to reject, vary, or amend the terms of a third-party litigation funding agreement, and that the Court have the power to deal with competing class actions. It pointed to its recommendation for the Court to have an express power to deal with competing class actions as a way of mitigating concerns about the impact that CFOs may have on a propensity towards competing class actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS concluded that while the availability of CFOs at the end of a proceeding promoted outcomes which are reasonable, proportionate and fair for all class members, the power to make CFOs at any point throughout the proceedings would encourage speculative and less considered class action litigation. This would be because a litigation funder would need to undertake a book build; a process that involves identifying, communicating with, and enrolling class members in the action and by signing the litigation funding agreement. The PJCCFS noted arguments that book building facilitates an assessment of the merits and viability of a claim in a class action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS also considered the impact of CFOs on limiting windfall profits for litigation funders. It concluded that while CFOs were one way the Federal Court could adjust litigation funding fees, "codified requirements on what.is considered a fair and reasonable return to litigation funders is a more robust and effective way of addressing the high cost of litigation funding".<span style="font-style:italic;">[14]</span> The PJCCFS also highlighted that making a CFO at the end of a proceeding would enable it to be made when there was greater certainty about the class action profile and transaction costs incurred.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the need to ensure that all class members who benefit from a judgment or settlement contribute to its costs. At the same time, the Government questions whether a funder should be able to impose its commission on class members who have not agreed to be part of a class action litigation funding scheme. Further, any reforms in this space must necessarily align with the</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has therefore consulted on exposure draft legislation that would provide that a litigation funding agreement is unenforceable when a CFO is made. The Government notes that the Courts have already developed a range of mechanisms to enable the Court to ensure that the burden of costs associated with class action litigation are equitably shared amongst those who gain a financial benefit from the action, thus addressing 'free-rider' and privity of contract concerns.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Funders may decide to undertake a book build to inform their decision to support a class action; that is identifying, communicating with and enrolling class members in the action and getting them to sign a litigation funding agreement. The PJCCFS has noted that this could lead to a greater level of investigation of the level of interest among class members. The Government also considers that book building can ensure that the merits and viability of a claim is assessed more thoroughly before a class action is commenced.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government <span style="font-weight:bold;">notes </span>these recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that it would be desirable to ensure that the Court is properly empowered to make sure that all beneficiaries of a judgment or settlement contribute to the costs of the class action. This avoids the 'free-rider' problem and upholds the privity of contract doctrine by ensuring that litigation funders cannot impose obligations on a class member to contribute to the funder's commission where they are not party to a litigation funding agreement. As the PJCCFS has highlighted, the High Court's decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">Brewster </span>has highlighted that there are doubts about whether, and on what basis, such an order can be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government questions as a matter of principle whether the terms of a litigation funding agreement should apply to class members who are not members of a class action litigation funding scheme. This includes the commission that the funder would impose on members of the funding scheme. Therefore, the Government is considering reforms under which a litigation funding agreement would be unenforceable if a CFO is made during class action proceedings. The Government released exposure draft legislation to consult on this approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes that the Court has developed other mechanisms that avoid the free-rider problem. Such mechanisms are more clearly aligned with the principle of sharing costs incurred for the benefit of the entire class. Additionally, these mechanisms may place a greater onus on funders to undertake book building to manage their commercial risk. This will enable the interest of the class, and the merits and viability of a claim, to be more thoroughly assessed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and ALRC made recommendations targeting various aspects of the Federal Court's case management powers over class actions. These include powers relating to: ensuring procedural proportionality; open and closed class actions; competing class actions; the obligations of litigation funders in relation to certain costs orders; and imposing standards of conduct on litigation funders.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS recommended that procedural proportionality in class actions should be improved. This would mean that the length of proceedings and costs associated with a class action should be proportionate to what is at stake. It considered that the proportionality of a claim should be considered at the commencement of a proceedings. The PJCCFS affirmed though that this should not amount to a summary judgment which touches on the merits of a claim.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC recommended that the Government amend the Federal Court Act so that all representative proceedings are initiated as open class actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC noted that open class actions are the most efficient way of securing a single decision on issues common to all and reducing the costs of determining all related issued arising from a wrongdoing. The ALRC further observed that open class actions protect vulnerable groups who may be less likely or less able to take positive steps to join a class action themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCFFS recommended that the Government legislate to provide the Federal Court with an express statutory power to close a class. It noted that the Federal Court had made such orders under section 33ZF of the Federal Court Act, but that its ability to do so had been cast into doubt by various court decisions. The PJCFFS noted that the Federal Court's ability to close the class in a representative proceeding is essential to the objective of the class action regime to provide finality for respondents at the centre of a dispute. It cited submissions that highlighted two key benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, that a class closure order enabled the identity and number of class members entitled to share in any settlement to be determined. Second, that it promoted finality because unregistered members of the class are bound by the settlement and cannot litigate the common claims which were the subject of the class action. The PJCCFS cited section 33ZG of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Supreme Court of Victoria Act 1986 </span>(Vic) as a model for legislating an express power to close a class.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS, and ALRC, also considered that a class closure order, once made, should be considered final unless the re-opening of the class is in the interest of justice. As such, the PJCCFS and ALRC considered that the Federal Court's Class Actions Practice Note should include criteria for the Court to apply when exercising its discretion to close or re-open a class.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and ALRC recommended that the Government legislate an express statutory power for the Federal Court to resolve competing class actions, as a mechanism to promote efficiency of the class actions regime. The PJCCFS and ALRC noted that competing class actions impede the objectives of Australia's class action regime to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of the administration of justice. Competing and multiple class actions add unnecessary cost, delay and complexity for plaintiffs and defendants, as the same claim may be unnecessarily litigated several times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reports also recommended that the Federal Court's Practice Note be amended to include further case management procedures for competing class actions. The PJCCFS and ALRC identified that there is currently no guidance in the Federal Court's Class Actions Practice Note in determining how to resolve competing class actions or how to determine which action has the most merit to proceed (as opposed to setting out a process for considering these issues).</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and ALRC recommended that the Federal Court Act be amended so that litigation funding agreements expressly provide a complete indemnity in favour of the representative plaintiff against an adverse costs order. The reports considered that as a matter of principle, litigation funders should indemnify a representative plaintiff from adverse costs in every class action. This indemnity protects the representative plaintiff, and class members, and ensures that funders assume the risk of a class action when they potentially stand to gain significantly from the action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst the PJCCFS noted that most litigation funding agreements already include this term of indemnity, it considered that further measures are needed to mandate this practice. As such, the both the PJCCFS and ALRC recommended that the Federal Court Act be amended so that litigation funding agreements expressly provide a complete indemnity in favour of the representative plaintiff against an adverse costs order. Further, the PJCCFS recommended that the Federal Court should not approve a litigation funding agreement unless this indemnity has been included.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and the ALRC recommended that the government legislate a statutory presumption that the litigation funder in a class action provide security for costs. If this presumption were legislated, security for costs would be required in every class action proceeding unless the litigation funder could establish why they should not be ordered. The ALRC considered that a presumption is more appropriate than a mandatory requirement as it retains the Court's discretion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Presently, litigation funders are not required to provide security for costs unless the defendant to the proceedings makes an application for an order for security for costs. Furthermore, the burden currently rests with the defendant to prove why the funders should provide security for costs. The PJCCFS considered that security for costs is a necessary protection for defendants to a class actions, as these orders are an effective means of ensuring litigation funders meet their obligations to a defendant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS also noted that the AFSL does not require litigation funders to have adequate financial resources or hold security for costs for litigation purposes. AFSL requirements also do not seek to prevent an AFSL holder from falling insolvent, or failing due to poor business models or cash flow problems. As such, it considered that the requirement to hold an AFSL is not a sufficient mechanism to ensure that a litigation funder has the necessary funds, should an adverse costs order be made.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS recommended that section 43 of the Federal Court Act be amended to enable the Court to make a costs order against a litigation funder. The Committee recommended this in the context of a suite of measures to deter litigation funders from charging higher than accepted costs, including the use of litigation funding fee assessors and enabling the costs of recourse to such assessors to be recovered from a funder where their conduct justified this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and ALRC recommended that the Federal Court Act be amended to confer an express power to impose standards of conduct on litigation funder and to award costs for failure to comply with these standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS recommended that the Government amend the Federal Court Act to confer a power to the Federal Court to hold parties, their lawyers, and litigation funders to the same standards of conduct in class actions. The recommended standards include the overarching purpose under section 37M of the Federal Court Act as well those statutory standards of conduct captured in sections 16 to 26 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Civil Procedure Act 2010 </span>(Vic) (Victorian Civil Procedure Act).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Section 37M(2) provides a non-exhaustive list of objectives that help to define the overarching purpose of the civil practice and procedure provisions. These are: the just determination of all proceedings before the Court; the efficient use of the judicial and administrative resources available for the purposes of the Court; the efficient disposal of the Court's overall caseload; the disposal of all proceedings in a timely manner; the resolution of disputes at a cost that is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matters in dispute. Section 37N requires parties to act consistently with the overarching purpose and indicates that failure to comply with this overarching purpose must be taken into account when the Court exercises its discretion to award costs under</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">section 43 of the Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS affirmed that litigation funders should be held to the same standard as parties and lawyers to the litigation, given the level of control they can exert over proceedings. It recommended that the framework in the Federal Court currently (under sections 37M and 43) be extended to funders. The PJCCFS also noted that some obligations enshrined in the Victorian Civil Procedure Act's standards of conduct reflect obligations already placed on litigation funders through the AFSL and MIS regimes, such as the duty to act honestly. Whilst ASIC's regulatory powers are targeted at the regulation of funders based on their provision of a financial product, the PJCCFS observed that the Victorian statutory standards of conduct are focused on the obligation of a litigation funder to facilitate a fair, efficient and affordable civil law system through their conduct in a proceeding.<span style="font-style:italic;">[15]</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, the ALRC identified that an express power to permit the Court to make costs orders against funders (or insurers) who do not comply with this overarching purpose would enhance the Courts ability to supervise third party litigation funders during proceedings. It suggested that this power would provide a more targeted regulatory intervention than a licensing regime administered by ASIC.<span style="font-style:italic;">[16]</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government agrees with most of these recommendations. The Government will progress legislation to bolster the protective and supervisory role of the Court with respect to class members, and uphold the judicial economy that the class action mechanism brings. This will codify key protections that litigation funders do, and should, offer class members in exchange for a share of any proceeds.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government disagrees, however, with the recommendation to legislate that all class actions should be open as a default. As noted earlier, the Government is committed to creating a class action regime founded on 'book-building' to ensure that the interest of class members, and the merits and viability of a claim, are thoroughly assessed. Further, it should remain open to class members to determine how they wish their claim to be progressed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports this recommendation to undertake further investigation into legislative change. Such changes, alongside other recommendations made by the PJCCFS and ALRC report, would help uphold the principles that recourse to litigation, including class actions, should occur where genuinely warranted in the circumstances, and that litigation should be conducted in a manner that is proportionate to what is at stake in the proceedings.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not support this recommendation. The Government recognises that open class actions can be beneficial in certain circumstances. However, currently representative plaintiffs can determine whether to commence their class action as an open or closed action. This preserves the ability of a group to control the size and scope of the class actions. Additionally, class members, or a subset of them, are able to choose whether to participate in a matter, and which lawyer (and funder) would represent (and fund) them. Further, the Government is committed to a class action regime founded on 'book-building' which requires a funder to individually identify members of a class to sign a litigation funding agreement. Such a process ensures that there is genuine interest among class members, and that the merits and viability of a claim are thoroughly assessed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS and the ALRC recommended a number of legislative amendments to the Federal Court's powers and procedure during the settlement approval stage of proceedings. This includes: requiring certain information as part of an application for settlement approval; powers to make costs orders against parties in certain circumstances; and powers to appoint individuals to assist in the determination of reasonable costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS recommended that the Federal Court require the provision of a certain types of information accompany an application for approval of a class action settlement. In making this recommendation, the PJCCFS cited the current lack of transparency of current litigation funding in the class actions regime and the lack of transparency of settlement agreements (notwithstanding the importance of confidentiality orders in facilitating settlements). The PJCCFS raised concerns about the number of class actions for which there is limited or no information publicly available relating to the costs associated with litigation funding. The PJCCFS noted that increased transparency surrounding the circumstances of litigation funding in a case leads to increased accountability, as a funder's actions are subject to increased scrutiny. This increased scrutiny in turn protects class members. The PJCCFS envisioned that information provided to the court under this recommendation should be published once the settlement is approved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the ALRC explored issues related to confidentiality orders made at judgment or settlement approval. The Commission concluded than he current discretion of the Federal Court to make confidentiality orders was sufficient and should not be fettered. The ALRC noted that there were other ways by which data could be captured and group members and the public could be informed, including through settlement administrators as discussed below.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCFFS recommended that the Federal Court amend its Class Actions Practice Note to introduce a presumption that the Federal Court is to appoint a contradictor in instances where there is the potential for significant conflicts of interest, or where complex issues are likely to arise at a settlement approval application. This presumption is to sit alongside guidance on scenarios in which this conflict of interest is likely to arise. The PJFCCFS considered that a presumption would ensure that the Federal Court retains discretion and the presumption can be rebutted in appropriate cases.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS had regard to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bolitho v Banksia Securities Limited (No. 4)17 </span>class action where the extensive work of a contradictor uncovered allegations of serious misconduct by the lawyers and litigation funders. The PJCCFS noted that contradictors are an effective tool that can be used by the Federal Court to protect class members against excessive legal costs and litigation funding fees.18 It characterised contradictors as an effective check and balance on the litigation funding industry, as and when required. The Federal Court currently has the power to appoint a contradictor. However the PJCCFS noted that it did not have sufficient information to determine how commonly this power was utilised. The PJCFFS noted that the improved outcomes for class member when a contradictor is engaged emphasises the need for contradictors to be used more widely in class actions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the PJCCFS recommended that the Government implement a procedure to facilitate communication of the class member's concerns about settlement to a contradictor, when a contradictor is appointed. Additionally, it recommended class members should be informed of the questions to be determined by the contradictor in an effort to increase transparency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC recommended that the Federal Court's Class Actions Practice Note be amended to provide that the Court may appoint a referee to assess the reasonableness of legal costs charged in a class action, prior to settlement approval. In making this recommendation, the ALRC highlighted the benefits of using an independent referee, who is not tied in any way to the law firm in question, to determine reasonableness of costs.<span style="font-style:italic;">[19]</span> The ALRC noted that whilst the Federal Court already has the power to appoint a referee to review legal costs and disbursements, under section 54A of the Federal Court Act, it did not commonly do so in practice.<span style="font-style:italic;">[20]</span> Hence the ALRC sought to embed the practice of appointing a referee by including it in the Practice Note.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC noted that the appointment of a referee will not always be appropriate.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC made two recommendations to make amendments to the Class Actions Practice Note relating to the administration of a settlement in a class action. First, that the Court may tender settlement administration. Second, that the settlement administrator be required to provide a report to group members and the Court upon completion of the settlement sum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following settlement approval, the award to a class needs to be administered and distributed amongst the class members - a process which is commonly conducted by the plaintiff law firm. According to the ALRC, settlement administration is often complex and time consuming, and as such can lead to sizeable administration fees that are taken out of the award prior to distribution. Hence it considered that a formalised tender process may assist in reducing the costs charged in the settlement administration process and may improve the overall efficiency of administration processes into the future, as firms interested in tendering for such work refine their practices in response to a competitive tendering system.22 In saying this, the ALRC identified the potential risk that the Court would be required to involve itself in the assessment of the tenders, which would lead to an increased workload.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, noting the current difficulties in obtaining accurate settlement data in class actions proceedings, the ALRC recommended that the final report of the settlement administrator be published in a national representative proceedings database to be maintained by the Court. This recommendation would allow the Court to stay informed of progress and costs of settlement administration. Furthermore, by having this information available in the public domain, the Court, class members, policy makers and industry participants will be provided with a greater understanding of how class actions proceedings resolve.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS and ALRC adopted different positions with respect to the merits of contingency fees, and the desirability of legislating to permit such arrangements in class actions before the Federal Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lawyers can currently take on matters on a conditional fee or uplift basis. A conditional fee is the payment of legal costs from a client to a lawyer where, subject to a 'no win, no fee' arrangement, payment is conditional on a successful outcome in the case. An uplift fee is an additional fee that is usually included in conditional funding agreements, intended to compensate solicitors for carrying the risk of the litigation. An uplift fee is calculated as a percentage of the billed amount, and considered as a form of interest for the deferred payment of fees over the course of the proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ostensibly these options provide an alternative to requiring plaintiffs or litigation funders to fund lawyer fees, by the lawyers taking on some measure of risk themselves. This represents a shift from the 'tripartite' arrangement that typifies class actions (constituting the representative plaintiff, lawyer and funder).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Contingency fees, on the other hand, are prohibited except in Victoria. A contingency fee arrangement is one where legal costs are calculated as a percentage of any recovered award in a class action proceeding (i.e. compensation to lawyers is directly tied to the quantum recovered through proceedings). Proponents argue that contingency fee arrangements enable law firms to compete with litigation funders, thereby placing downward pressure on litigation funding commission rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC report recommended the limited introduction of contingency fees. It considered that this would provide a greater return to group members and further enable medium-sized class action matters to proceed. The ALRC also considered that because class actions are strictly supervised by the Court, contingency fees would provide protection for representative plaintiffs and group members against paying a single yet disproportionate or unreasonable fee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Conversely, the PJCCFS raised concerns about conflicts of interest (lawyers having a direct financial interest in a matter) that may arise if contingency fees were permitted. It also observed that the impact on access to justice was potentially overstated because only a select few law firms would have access to sufficient capital to be able to undertake the risk required to compete for class actions that are typically funded by litigation funders. The PJCCFS therefore refrained from recommending that contingency fees be permitted in the Federal Court. It also made recommendations relating to the regulation of lawyers operating on a contingency fee arrangements or uplift fee arrangements in actions involving a litigation funder.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government agrees with the PJCCFS that allowing contingency fees creates a significant risk of conflicts of interest. The Government notes that while the ALRC report recommended the introduction of contingency fee agreements in limited conditions, the PJCCFS concluded that the potential for lawyers to enter into contingency fee arrangements was not outweighed by the public interest outcomes potentially achieved with the availability of this charging structure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The findings of the PJCCFS highlight the issues caused by the decision of the Victorian Government to progress legislation through the Victorian Parliament to allow contingency fees in class action</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">proceedings before the Supreme Court of Victoria. The Victorian Government did so unilaterally, without consulting other jurisdictions. This has led to an undesirable fragmentation in the approach to this matter across Australian jurisdictions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports recommendations to review the feasibility of applying the AFSL and MIS regimes to contingency fee arrangements.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and ALRC inquiries made recommendations to address the risk that class action proceedings, especially those that are funded by third-party litigation funders, give rise to particular circumstances likely to result in actual or perceived conflicts of interest. While conflicts are inherent in some aspects of the Australian class action regime, if not adequately addressed, they can lead to detrimental outcomes for some or all class members. A proper framework for managing conflicts of interest is particularly important given the high degree of control and influence a litigation funder has, and the significant financial stakes that may be at play in class actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS highlighted the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Bolitho v Banksia Securities Limited (No. </span>4)2<span style="font-style:italic;">[5]</span> as a key example of such challenges. In this case, the plaintiff's lawyers held significant financial interests in a company incorporated to fund the class action. Following a decision by the Supreme Court of Victoria that the lawyers should not continue to act in the matter whilst holding an interest in the litigation funder, it was alleged that the legal representatives continued to maintain interests as both funder and lawyer in the case. It was further alleged that they advanced their own interest at the expense and detriment of the interests of class members. These allegations are still awaiting determination by the Supreme Court of Victoria. The PJCCFS acknowledged that this case may be atypical in the class action and litigation funding industry. However, in its view, the case demonstrated the need for a strict separation between the litigation funder and representative plaintiff's lawyers as a conflict arising between the two would be unmanageable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCCFS emphasised that concerns about conflicts of interest are particularly acute when the interests of litigation funders are prioritised over the interests of class members. The PJCCFS report recommended that standards should be set that both lawyers and funders have an obligation to avoid conflicts of interest. Where such conflicts do arise, the PJCCFS affirmed the need for robust and appropriate disclosure and management processes, requirements and mechanisms, to protect the interests of class members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC also found that while funding agreements generally make clear that solicitors and funders must act in the interest of class members, funders are often intimately involved in proceedings. The ALRC highlighted the conflicts of interest that may arise for solicitors who may be influenced by the commercial needs of funders with whom they have established a relationship, or when there are multiple classes within the one action. The ALRC recommended increased education for solicitors, primarily through a voluntary class action accreditation scheme, and increased guidance to provide a common set of professional and ethical principles for Australian solicitors in managing conflicts of interest. Additionally, like the PJCCFS, the ALRC emphasised the importance of early communication of conflicts of interest to group members. Both reports provided guidance on how disclosures are best managed and recommended the disclosure of potential or actual conflicts of interest at the earliest possible opportunity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will progress legislation to prohibit a solicitor acting for the representative plaintiff in a litigation funded matter from seeking to recover unpaid legal fees from the representative plaintiff or group members.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the PJCCFS and ALRC have affirmed the benefits of class actions generally, there have been concerns about the merits of class actions in the securities context. Concerns were raised around the growth of an 'entrepreneurial' approach to the commencement of shareholder claims and the increase in the number of 'competing' shareholder claims. The PJCCFS also found that shareholder class actions typically disproportionally benefited litigation funders rather than plaintiffs with large percentages of the settlement being allocated to legal cost and litigation funder commissions. The inquiries also noted a greater propensity for Australian corporate entities to be the target of funded shareholder class actions and a diminution in the value of the investments of those shareholders · during the period of the class action. Some stakeholders submitted to the PJCCFS that securities</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the PJCCFS and ALRC found that claims for a breach of continuous disclosure laws underpinned many shareholder class action. The ALRC recommended the laws around continuous disclosure be reviewed, considering the legal, and economic impact of these obligations under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Act 2001. </span>The PJCCFS, which conducted its inquiry after the Government introduced temporary COVID-19 measures to address this issue, recommended that these measures be made permanent. It noted that a balance needed to be struck between market transparency and integrity, and reducing economically inefficient shareholder class actions.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (REGIONAL COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 2021</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Act 1901</span> to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement - RCEP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Once it comes into force for all 15 signatories, RCEP will be the world's largest free trade agreement, bringing together nine of Australia's top 15 trading partners - that together account for nearly 60 per cent of our trade and about two-thirds of our exports - into a single economic framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The signing of RCEP in November 2020 by Australia, the ten ASEAN member states, China, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea, signalled a commitment to opening up new trade and investment opportunities and support for rules-based trading arrangements. These signals are especially important in the face of the challenges of COVID-19 and emerging global trade tensions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The negotiation of RCEP was driven by the ten ASEAN nations, which collectively constitute Australia's second-largest two-way trading partner. Having considered a number of options for expanding opportunities for regional trade, ASEAN chose to pursue a more inclusive approach that would extend to all of ASEAN's then FTA partners, including Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian participation in RCEP negotiations has allowed us to influence the rules incorporated in RCEP. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to work with ASEAN and other RCEP signatory states to shape the implementation and future direction of RCEP so that it contributes to the development of open, transparent approaches to regional trade and investment; and bolsters ASEAN's role in the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Active Australian participation in RCEP will be needed to maximise our influence, requiring a substantial investment on the part of the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">RCEP delivers a range of improvements over our existing FTAs with RCEP partners - especially in areas where our partners' economies have the greatest growth potential, such as services, investment and digital trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">RCEP will help stimulate growth, strengthen economic integration, and build business confidence in our region. RCEP signatory states account for around 30 per cent of the world's population and GDP. No other free trade agreement brings together the collective economic weight of the ASEAN nations and the major economies in North Asia. RCEP also provides for additional economies to join RCEP in the future - building the significance of RCEP over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">RCEP will lock in market access and address non-tariff barriers, creating significant new trade and investment opportunities for Australia across the Indo-Pacific. It will also establish rules that provide greater certainty and improve the business environment across the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">RCEP's regional rules of origin will support access to regional value chains, thus increasing opportunities for Australian business. Regional cumulation rules will facilitate inputs from the most efficient and cost-effective regional source, while supporting access to preferential tariff treatment. Goods made in another RCEP party from Australian exports - for example, iron ore, wheat, barley, milk powder, copper, nickel and wool - would benefit from tariff preferences under RCEP when processed in a second RCEP party and exported to a third.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">RCEP will reduce FTA rules of origin compliance burdens, meaning that Australian businesses trading with multiple RCEP parties will only need to comply with one set of rules and procedures. RCEP will also provide businesses with greater choice in how they meet origin documentation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will insert into the Customs Act the rules of origin and document retention requirements called for by RCEP. The Bill outlines when imported goods may be considered to have originating status and be eligible for preferential tariff treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is complemented by the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021, which will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Tariff Act 1995</span>.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Tariff Act 1995</span> (the Customs Tariff Act) to implement Australia's import tariff commitments under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will insert a new Schedule of duty rates into the Customs Tariff Act. Schedule 14 will contain the preferential rates of customs duty for imported goods that satisfy the rules of origin as agreed by Australia and other RCEP signatory countries. Australia has committed to eliminating the duty rate for most originating goods to 'Free' over the years following the entry into force of RCEP. Certain goods, such as excise equivalent goods, will retain a rate of customs duty other than 'Free'. Excise equivalent goods, which are certain fuel, alcohol, tobacco and petroleum products, that are considered originating under the agreement will continue to receive the same treatment as domestically produced equivalents.</span>

But this government doesn't want you to know that. That's why the Greens have initiated this references committee inquiry into the UNESCO World Heritage Committee's attempted listing of the Great Barrier Reef as 'in danger'. The whole country is talking about COP26. In fact, the whole world is focused on Glasgow and how the international community are going to come together and reduce emissions. If I had my way, I would commandeer COP26, at least for the first day, and, as a matter of urgent priority, I would have the world look at the latest science on the Great Barrier Reef, the exact science that the IPCC report used, to recommend that the reef be downgraded to 'in danger'. I would recommend that the entire COP26 entourage had an urgent briefing on the Great Barrier Reef and the sad, tragic decline of this world's greatest natural wonder.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing complicated about the tragic decline we have seen in the Great Barrier Reef, particularly in the last decade. We're not talking about numbers here. We're not talking about pathways to net zero by 2050 or what's required by 2030. What we are looking at is a stark reminder of our failure to take climate action. If the world were to see the true state of the Great Barrier Reef and the real science that tells us that the Great Barrier Reef, if we continue along a trajectory of business as usual, will be gone in this century, I believe that would trigger a significant global action, because, if the Great Barrier Reef is in severe decline, that means most of the world's coral reefs are also in that sad decline.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens initiated this inquiry some months ago, and we have brought it here this evening to debate and, if we can, put to a vote. But I understand that is probably not going to be possible. This attempt by the government to deny the science, to put politics above the science, to postpone the inevitable—and we all know the Great Barrier Reef is in danger—must be exposed. The government's excuses, their deceptions and, in fact, I would say their downright lies, their panic, when the World Heritage Committee apparently blindsided them by saying they were going to list the Great Barrier Reef as 'in danger'—this august chamber needs to look at the process. It needs to look at why UNESCO was going to list the reef as 'in danger' and the science behind that. We need to speak to the experts. But we also need to look at the government's reasons.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  [by video link] Good health is something many of us once took for granted, but the coronavirus pandemic the world has lived through over the past 18 months has forced us all to take stock of our health and wellbeing. To some it has been a distraction, and regular health checks may have gone by the wayside. That's why it is important that we all take extra care to keep those appointments and have any medical concerns that we do have checked out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">October is both Breast Cancer Awareness Month and Dyslexia Awareness Month, and tonight I would like to touch on both. Many of us are familiar with the pink ribbon that signifies breast cancer awareness. Despite our familiarity with the pink symbol and our unwavering support for breast cancer events, breast cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosed in Australian women, with one in seven likely to be diagnosed in their lifetime. It is also one that my family is all too familiar with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that survival rates continue to improve in Australia, with 91 out of every 100 women diagnosed with breast cancer now surviving for five or more years beyond diagnosis. One key factor in these positive survival rates is early detection, which also opens up more treatment options. The Cancer Council estimates that, in Australia, nearly 20,000 women and around 164 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. It is important, for both women and men, to look for breast changes and to see a doctor if you notice anything unusual. Do not ignore the signs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another condition that benefits from early diagnosis is dyslexia. The Australian Dyslexia Association explains it as 'a persistent difficulty with reading and spelling', defining it as 'a specific learning difference that is neurobiological in origin'. The association says dyslexia 'is characterised by challenges with accurate and/or fluent single word decoding and word recognition', and there can also be difficulties with spelling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dyslexia affects 10 per cent of the Australian population; however, the actual figure could be higher, as many individuals are not identified. Even with early intervention, dyslexia can remain a challenge throughout life. It can impact reading comprehension and experience, impede vocabulary growth and background knowledge, and cause social and emotional issues. Children with dyslexia learn in different ways, often excelling in other areas like creative thinking and leadership. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">University of Tasmania vice-chancellor Professor Rufus Black, around-the-world solo sailor Jessica Watson, entrepreneur Dick Smith and author Jackie French are just some of the creative and innovative Australians who have been diagnosed with dyslexia. Jackie French wrote a letter to fellow dyslexics, urging them not to give up: 'Reading helps you understand your world, yourself and what you and the world one day may become.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month I urge my Senate colleagues to help spread awareness of breast cancer and dyslexia in their communities. It is through those conversations that we learn more and share that knowledge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I want to take you back to where I started: the global coronavirus pandemic. After a long run with no COVID-19 cases, Tasmania has been in the news in recent weeks owing to two people breaching quarantine, spending time in the community and testing positive to the virus. Tasmanian residents stepped up and got tested and vaccinated in record numbers, knowing that vaccinations are the best way to protect themselves and their communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past 24 hours, Australia has passed the total of 32 million vaccine doses administered—that is, 85 per cent of the eligible population aged 16 and over are now protected with at least a first dose. Pleasingly, both nationally and in my home state of Tasmania, today we have reached full vaccination of 70 per cent of those aged 16 and over. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank each and every Australian who has been vaccinated, and I urge those who haven't to make an appointment today. It is also worth noting that a variety of treatments have been secured by the government for COVID-19, in the form of oral antiviral drugs and intravenous treatments. These medicines will help protect those who contract COVID-19, but they do not replace vaccination. Quite simply, vaccinations are the way out of this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Special acknowledgement and my sincere thanks go to our health workers at hospitals, GP clinics, pharmacies and community and mobile clinics, who have worked tirelessly to ensure as many people are vaccinated as possible. None of this could have happened without their incredible dedication. Let's work together to reach our vaccination target so we can regain normality in our lives and reunite with our families and friends, and please do not overlook those other regular health checks. They are important too.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I'm joining more than 50 of my colleagues in this place and in the other place to mark Youth Voice in Parliament Week. This is a campaign run by Raise Our Voice Australia. This organisation is encouraging young people from diverse backgrounds to participate in politics and policymaking. In the same way that our country has benefited from having more women elected to parliament, so too will we benefit from ensuring and promoting greater diversity in other areas. So I think this is a wonderful campaign, and I am very honoured to be part of it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to share with you tonight a powerful speech written by Annabelle Thompson. Firstly, a big hello to Annabelle, her friends and her family who might be watching. Annabelle is 10 years old. She lives with her family in the electorate of Page in the Northern Rivers in New South Wales. This beautiful part of New South Wales is also where I spent my childhood, and growing up in a small town on the North Coast really helped shape my values. My neighbours, my classmates, my teachers, my friends and my sports coaches taught me a lot. They taught me about community, about acceptance and about what it takes to build a stronger, safer and fairer society, and some of these values are also visible in Annabelle's speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will let her words speak for themselves. Here we go: 'My vision for Australia in 20 years is for there to be no abuse or violence and much more equality. My name is Annabelle Thompson and I am 10 years old, and I will be 30 in 20 years. My electorate is Page, and today I will be telling you about two problems in Australia and how we can change them in the future. I would really like the people in Australia to accept the LGBTQI+ people in our community and to make sure that women and men are treated the same. This would include giving women the same payment as men and for LGBTQI+ people to be accepted for who they are and who they want to be. Having more equality would mean that when I grow up and my friends grow up we can get paid well and can be who we want to be without worrying. Abuse is not nice. I'm sure you wouldn't want it to happen to any of your friends, family members and pets. There are many forms of abuse, including animal abuse, domestic violence and cyberbullying. In 2020, one in five kids have been cyberbullied, one in four women experience domestic violence and, lastly, up to 60,000 cases of animal abuse have been reported. People should be jailed for abuse or fined a lot of money. Having no abuse when I am older would be great, because I will be safe, my children will be safe and so will my pets. This is my vision for Australia in 20 years, and hopefully most of it comes true.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Annabelle, and congratulations on your vision, which is so obviously born of a deep compassion and respect for the people who live around you and your community. I hope all that comes true too.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  Mr President, congratulations. This week the Juukan inquiry report was tabled. We have heard from so many of you in this place about the importance of protecting First Nations cultural heritage. Well, guess what: it's happened again. It's not in the newspapers, and you're not screaming about it in the chamber, but it's happened again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where did it happen? In Queensland under the Labor government, this time. The Kabi Kabvai people of the Gympie region in Queensland are fighting to protect their sacred site, the Djaki Kundu. The Djaki Kundu is an ancient healing site. The sovereign native tribes of the Kabi First Nations say it is connected to the creator, Biral. It is the place to learn about the sky ancestors, the Seven Sisters Dreaming story and the creation of Kabi at the beginning of time. Protecting and using the site to perform ceremony is an important part of the Kabi people's spiritual and religious practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The site is under threat from works by the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads for the Bruce Highway expansion between Cooroy and Curra. These works have been signed off by native title applicants over the area, and the department is ignoring that Kabi cultural heritage exists at the site. The groups under the native title claim have changed over the years—surprise, surprise. As we learnt during the Juukan inquiry, native title alone does not tell you who has cultural heritage links to a site. We know native title is dodgy; we heard that. We need to learn—you need to learn—to listen to all traditional owners that are concerned, not just the ones that will tell you what you want to hear. You know that's part of the sophistication of how you manufacture consent: you go to the 'yes' people and you leave behind the people that are trying to fight for country. In November 2020, a court found that the Kabi people have a right to protect their country. That is all Kabi people, not just the native title claimants that you choose.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kabi people themselves have been busy carrying out scientific studies of the area to document their cultural heritage, yet the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads had six traditional owners arrested and imprisoned. The bail conditions now prevent them from returning to their sacred site. Their tribal camp, including their bush food and medicine gardens, was destroyed, and we don't know what happened to the sacred Kab'vai bees. Tribal elders are now separated from the ancestral spirits and country at the Djaki Kundu. They have seen their sacred fire extinguished. They are removed from their spiritual home and are traumatised and in sorry business.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research materials, tools and tribal artefacts recovered during the scientific study of the Djaki Kundu were taken by the Department of Transport and Main Roads. The Djaki Kundu has thousands of Kabi artefacts and other evidence as it has been used for ceremony by Kabi ancestors since the beginning of time. It is again a sign of the continuation of the colonial oppression of our people when government departments intentionally destroy our heritage and interfere with processes to protect it. Minister Ley, I call on you to make use of your ministerial powers: do the right thing and protect the Djaki Kundu. We all said 'never again' when Juukan happened. When will we actually mean it?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Au</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">stralia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:33</span>):  I rise this evening to give a voice to the views of young people in my home state of Western Australia. Like many in this place, I believe it to be of the upmost importance for all senators to have at the forefront of their minds the attitudes, aspirations and concerns of our nation's youth. Of course, we know it is the young people of today who will inherit the decisions that we take in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this spirit, I'd like to present today the views of two young Western Australians who participated in the parliamentary Raise Your Voice competition. Put simply, they were motivated to share their vision of Australia in 20 years time. I'm delighted to share that vision with the Senate. For the record, I have consciously chosen two young Western Australians, not from our cities but from regional Western Australia. The voice of regional Western Australia should always be amplified, and it's a task I bring to the Senate on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis. The first of these is 15-year-old Frank Stevenson, who is from the wheatbelt town of Cunderdin, 156 kilometres east of Perth. Frank shares these comments: 'In 20 years, I see Australia having environmental strategies that will prevent further population and damage to our environment. This is important to me because I want a stable future for the next generations to come so that they can have similar experiences to those that we enjoy now. I'd also like to see improvements to health facilities in rural Western Australia as it's necessary as accidents occur frequently and access to a hospital can be difficult. Live export is another strong part of Australia's economy and is very important to livestock owners around regional WA. Keeping live exports will help support the regional people of Western Australia and flow money back into our regional economies. This can be achieved by political reform, awareness of climate through events, and actions from parliament.' What a great, refreshing perspective from Frank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My next comments are from 16-year-old Lachie Forshaw, who is from a cattle station 200 kilometres from Broome in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Lachie Forshaw writes: 'In 20 years, I expect Australia's rural areas to have similar facilities to those available in the cities. This can be achieved by, for example, covering rural areas with good internet—probably 5G or 6G by then. I believe this is important as, currently, kids and families grow up without communication with the outside world and often have social and educational issues when they are older or leave home. Easier access to food would also greatly benefit our rural areas by placing more roadhouses along highways and in more-remote areas. Growing up in a cattle station, I know that it can be expensive to simply drive to a town or your local community, often 100 kilometres away, just to get food. If we don't resolve these issues, families living in rural areas will be forced to leave and move to the city, and food production and the identity of true Australians will be lost.' Well done, Lachie. As someone who is a regular traveller across the Kimberley region, I know well the very long stretches of road and the isolation they can bring to pastoral communities across the far north of Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend these two young Western Australians for their concern and for their vision of Australia. I remind my Senate colleagues from across the chamber of the responsibility that we owe two young Australians. They are the national leaders of tomorrow.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  Today a great trauma came to the communities around Kembla Grange in New South Wales, where a train was derailed. In response to that the RTBU, ably led in New South Wales Alex Claassens and nationally by Mark Diamond, reached out to support the workers who were on that train, and provided for support to wrap around that community. That's just one of the things that union would have done to support Australian workers today. I understand that the place has been declared a crime scene. I hope that community can recover from the shock of that experience. I know they will look after each other the best they can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the recent New South Wales Labor conference a contribution was made by the branch secretary of the USU, Graeme Kelly OAM. He acknowledged the amazing work of our council workers, particularly in the context of the pandemic. He spoke very, very true words when he said that council workers continue to deliver the services that our communities rely upon every single day, and our local community and their families rely upon all of these people: those who provide child care, aged care, the construction of municipal roads and infrastructure, public amenities, parks and reserves, recycling, waste collection, green waste collection, development and planning, footpaths, drainage, road maintenance, swimming and leisure centres, regulatory controls, parking, lifeguards, regional water and sewerage, animal control and welfare and saleyards. He said they're just some of the many services that are consistently delivered by council workers. I want to add my thanks to those who undertake those important roles in our community. I acknowledge the support they are given by the union, the USU, who make sure that those 55,000 New South Wales council workers and 365,000 council workers across Australia get the support they need by having a great union. So unions are supporting people in a time of crises today and unions are supporting people who are vital to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to make some remarks about another great piece of work that the unions do, and that is research into our community. I want to acknowledge the leadership of the New South Wales branch by Mr Bernie Smith of the SDA, the union for workers in retail, fast food and warehousing, and also the northern branch leader, Barbara Nebart, and the federal leader of the SDA, Gerard Dwyer, for this amazing piece of research. Around 6,500 people responded to a survey on the challenge of work, family and care, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Who Cares?</span> report documents the significant challenges that are being faced by Australians. It outlines the dilemma for many workers in how they struggle to balance casual and often insecure work with family obligations. Fifty-five cent of all participants in the research did some sort of regular unpaid care providing help or assistance to a child or young person, an adult person with a disability or a person with a long-term illness or health condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the workers surveyed were in that generation sandwiched between their kids and their increasingly elderly parents. The report shows that they lack genuine choice about their childcare arrangements, that their shifts are shaped by their employer's thirst for profit rather than taking care of their staff and enhancing their business in such a sensible way and that insecure and irregular work only adds to the stresses around care. The claims from the workers in this report are shocking. One worker reported: 'It was hard to jump straight back into full-time work while juggling a sick baby. I had no sick leave entitlements. It was hard. I was made to feel like I had to get straight back into it full force or they'd find someone to replace me.' That was said by the mother of a child with a disability. Another related their situation plainly: 'I'm a single mother that gets no child support and lives week to week on my wages.' These women and their colleagues carried us through the pandemic, yet they are still, at this point in time, incredibly insecure in terms of their financial wellbeing. Even for part-time workers the low base hour rate on part-time contracts as short as three hours in some cases are simply not enough to base their lives around and to manage their very important care obligations. This report talked about the disadvantage for kids who cannot participate in sport or extracurricular activities because their parents can't get a regular shift. These are vital findings about the reality of working people in Australia in the retail industry, and I commend all those unions—the SDA, the USU and the RTBU—to the Senate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  I rise to note International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day on 15 October. I'm pleased that earlier this year we moved that the Senate itself recognises this day. This recognition builds on the work of our 2018 Senate inquiry where we heard devastating evidence about the six babies who are stillborn in Australia every day. Our inquiry learned how First Nations peoples and peoples from diverse communities have much higher rates of stillbirth and how listening to women's experiences and voices can make such a difference to medical outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government adopted the recommendations of our inquiry, and it is good to note the progress that's been made in implementing them. It is critical that this progress continue, because stillbirth is a tragedy. My heart goes out to everyone who has experienced losing a baby. I thank those in this chamber and in the community who have taken the time this week to note the day, to share stories and to reach out to those of us have experienced stillbirths. The loss of my daughter Rose, 26 years ago, will never leave me. Supporting each other and sharing our stories and taking the action we can to help reduce the rate of stillbirth is truly life-saving work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week is Anti-Poverty Week, an opportunity to learn more about the experiences of poverty in Australia, and no-one need more of an education on this issue than our Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison. I recently heard from Melissa, a 39-year-old woman from Adelaide who is on JobSeeker. She lives with chronic illnesses and severe mental health issues that make it incredibly difficult for her to work. She has been relying on JobSeeker for many years. She told me: 'I have absolutely no savings at all. Basically you just have to wish for the best—that the fridge doesn't break or that you don't need new shoes. Anything like that puts a strain on the budget.' Every day millions of Australians like Melissa are being forced to make choices that no-one should ever have to make. Do you buy food or medication? Do you choose keeping a roof over your head or having shoes that don't have holes in them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't have to be this way. Last year, when people started receiving the COVID supplement, we finally saw what it could be like if we designed our economy to work for everyone, not just the megawealthy few. For Melissa, receiving the COVID supplement transformed her life. She told me: 'A lot of amazing things actually happened to me. I didn't need iron infusions, because I could actually afford to eat properly. It is actually life-changing. It's being able to do things. It was the first time in five years I was able to buy a winter coat.' It shouldn't be like that. People should be able to buy winter clothing. But, once again, the government has left Melissa and hundreds of thousands like her out in the cold, plunging the rate of JobSeeker back to a measly $44 a day. Poverty is a political choice. It's a policy choice. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is choosing to abandon his citizens. He is choosing to trap them in a cycle of property. He is choosing to give tax cuts to billionaires instead of raising the rate of JobSeeker above the bloody poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I read in Foodbank's annual <span style="font-style:italic;">Foodbank Hunger Report</span> that one in six Australian adults haven't had enough to eat in the last year. On top of this, 1.2 million children have gone hungry in this period. The two main reasons reported for food insecurity were unexpected expenses and overall low income. Why is it that we live in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, yet adults and children go hungry due to financial insecurity? It's because the Morrison government has made a deliberate choice to keep people on JobSeeker below the poverty line. They don't care that people are literally starving because of that choice. Research shows that, unlike in 2007, when jobseekers were typically able-bodied young men looking for work, people on JobSeeker today are likely to be older, to be women and, importantly, to have only a partial capacity to work due to chronic illness or disability. They are people like Melissa—people who shouldn't be demonised by their own government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not right, and it does not have to be this way. I call on the Australian government to permanently raise the rate of JobSeeker above the poverty line—to at least $80 a day—and to end this cycle of poverty once and for all.</span>

                  <a href="281697" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DA</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">VEY</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:47</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on Raise Our Voice's Youth Voice in Parliament Week campaign, as some of my colleagues have done previously. This campaign gives the youth across our nation the opportunity to have their voices heard within the parliament. I'd like to thank all of the young people who have participated this year. Some 600 submissions were made. They've partnered with 46 members of parliament and 22 senators from across the political spectrum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We may have our points of difference in this place; however, I believe that each and every one of us acknowledges the importance of involving young people in our political processes. I believe that we should always be open to the idea that there is more that we could be doing to involve young people in our political life and to engage with them. Having said that, I'm very happy to be standing here tonight to read a speech that was put before me—a speech with some very topical and current observations. This speech has been written and submitted by a young man, Mr Alexander Batshon from McDonald College in North Strathfield. I commend Mr Batshon on his thoughtful and observant comments and I hope that he will continue to take an active interest in the goings-on of this place. Without further ado, this is Mr Batshon's speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">2020 was a challenging year for young people and 2021 has shaped to be much the same albeit with a light at the end of the tunnel, vaccination. Young people have felt the brunt of coronavirus restrictions and were most affected by lockdowns. This was the case due to their employment often being in the industries most impacted by lockdowns, be it cinemas shutting or wearing masks at Woolworths. While young people have been left at the end of the queue for vaccination (albeit on sound health advice) with more of the general population including young adults becoming eligible to be vaccinated, I implore young people across Australia and especially in my home state of NSW to take this incredible opportunity afforded to them and protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities from the vicious scourge of COVID-19. Our generation has the capability to act based on the science like none before. It is time for Australia to move out of the darkness of the past two years characterised by disunity, lockdowns and fear and move forthrightly as a nation not divided but united around a shared set of democratic values to tackle the big issues that this place was meant to debate without the spectre of COVID haunting us any longer. Vaccination is the path out of this pandemic, and it is up to each of us how far we walk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After reading that, I think you'll agree that what I've just read contains some extraordinarily perceptive commentary. As a mother of teenagers myself, I can attest that the pandemic and the accompanying restrictions have taken a very heavy toll on young people. I'm very sympathetic on this issue, and I think in this place we should all be mindful of the challenges faced by our young people, particularly those at school or who've just entered the workforce. I'm particularly alert to the difficulties faced by our senior students who are trying to sit their final exams this year, and I wish them all the best, the very best. They should take pride in the fact that after two years of lockdowns and school shutdowns that they will be able to graduate this year, hopefully, and hopefully lead a very successful and fruitful life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This speech also touched on the employment and economic challenges of the pandemic for young people, and I know that's been very difficult, so I commend Mr Batshon and all his counterparts and friends, and I thank them for their patience and for rolling up their sleeves and coming forward. It is a good reality check for us to be hearing from young people, because there is still so much more we can do. Thank you very much, Mr Batshon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  Transport workers have been the definition of essential workers throughout this pandemic. They've kept supermarket shelves stocked, they've put vaccines and medical supplies into hospitals and they've continued to work day and night to keep Australia moving through lockdowns, often putting their own health and wellbeing at peril in the process. They don't ask for much in return, but they do want the same thing that every worker in Australia wants—job security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few weeks, with the support of the Transport Workers Union, transport workers from across Australia have taken legal strike action to protect their job security. They've taken strike action over attempts by transport companies to undercut them by bringing in outside hire and labour hire and lower rates of pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As soon as companies can bring in a second class of worker on lower rates of pay, we know they will eventually be used to squeeze the existing workforce out. We've seen it happen in the mining sector, where companies like BHP have booted workers onto labour hire contracts to cut their pay by up to 40 per cent. At many mines in Queensland, labour hire now accounts for the majority of the workforce. At Toll Group, FedEx, BevChain, Linfox and StarTrack, employee drivers and owner drivers have stood together and fought for their job security. Their collective voice and power has brought these larger employers back to the negotiating table. The Toll Group, Linfox and BevChain have reached an in-principle agreement with their workers, while talks are ongoing with FedEx.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Disgracefully, there's one hold out—StarTrack. This company is fully owned by the Australian government. The two ministerial shareholders—Minister Fletcher and Minister Birmingham—should come out here and explain why their company is fighting tooth and nail against the job security of the Australian workforce. In some yards in South Australia, StarTrack is already using labour hire to perform 70 per cent of the work alongside other outside hire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week both StarTrack and the Transport Workers Union appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Job Security. We heard from Matthew Spring, who has worked for StarTrack for the past seven years. Here's what Matthew had to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When I first started working for StarTrack, we had very little outside hire. … What we have now is 20 regular outside hire people who come in every day. … When we talk to them and we question them about what they're getting paid … they tell us that they're on $25 an hour on a flat rate on an ABN. … If one of them has an accident, they no longer come to work. That's the last time we'll see them. If someone brings too much freight back, that's the last time we see them. The company dismisses them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said, 'If they talk to me, as one of the site delegates, about the strike action that's going on'—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">we don't see them again. They just disappear, and new people come in to take their place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also received evidence that these labour hire workers and outside workers are engaged on sham contracting arrangements in order to circumvent the temporary migrant visa restrictions. This is an outrageous situation for a government-owned agency. Rather than engage in good faith on these issues, StarTrack has been launching slurs and lies at their own workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The TWU promised that industrial action would not disrupt medical supplies. This is a long-established process that has previously worked smoothly on numerous occasions. StarTrack showed up to the job security hearing last week and claimed that 1,500 medical deliveries had been disrupted. But here's the truth: if there were any medical deliveries disrupted, that is due to the incompetence and lack of foresight of the StarTrack management. StarTrack workers are going back on strike at midnight tonight. I stand in solidarity with the TWU, StarTrack workers and all drivers who are fighting for their job security.</span>
