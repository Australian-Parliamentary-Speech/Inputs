We have suggested to honourable members that they should be a little more careful when they are dealing with matters which are confined to very specific areas. We have also drawn attention to the fact that we believe that the Auditor-General should be given more facilities to enable his office to be able to undertake the far-ranging inquiry which some members of this House would like to have seen.

Indeed, I took the opportunity to put in a submission to a committee that has been undertaking a review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, and I certainly hope that the recommendations of myself, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) and one other member will be taken into account during any such review.

In supporting to a large degree the comments of the Chairman, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) I point out that the Committee had to undertake a very narrow task. The Auditor-General's team had to look at administrative matters associated with the Office of the Supervising Scientist. It did not have a brief to investigate or evaluate research but it did have a brief to look at the way the Office of the Supervising Scientist conducted its business and research, monitored the research that was being undertaken, and so on. It was found that there was a lack in that regard and the Office has undertaken to engage in certain procedures that will overcome that problem. As the Chairman said, other investigations into the Office are under way that will come to grips with the broader need to evaluate the whole operation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. There is a great need for that and we look forward to a further report of a much broader and more detailed nature in the future.

        —I wish to read a statement prepared by the Joint Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals and note that the report was in fact tabled, as required, on 30 November.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       On 28 February 1989 the Senate resolved to set up a joint select committee, to be known as the Joint Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals, to inquire into a number of matters related to the tenure of appointees to Commonwealth tribunals. On 1 March the House of Representatives agreed to the Senate's resolution. The Committee's inquiry dealt with a number of matters: the general nature and significance of tenure currently provided to appointees to Commonwealth tribunals; the adequacy of sections 24 and 28 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 in so far as it affected the tenure of presidential members and commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; and finally a number of matters raised by the non-reappointment of former Justice Staples to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, a matter which has been discussed at some length in this place and with which honourable members are no doubt familiar.
      </para>
      <para>
       In response to its advertisements and direct invitations to organisations and individuals believed to have an interest in this matter, the Committee received some 33 submissions and numerous brief letters. The submissions are tabled with the report, along with the transcripts of the Committee's two public hearings. The Committee wishes to thank all those people who have assisted it in this way.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the report the Committee has reached a series of conclusions and made a number of recommendations. Those conclusions and recommendations are clearly set out in the front of the report. However in the time available I would like to highlight some of those conclusions and recommendations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee concluded that, in order to perform their functions, tribunals need to be able to attract and have appointed to them people of superior talents and integrity. They also need to be able to ensure that appointees will not be influenced in their decision making by outside irrelevant considerations. In particular, they should not be influenced by the government of the day or any alternative government. In order to give effect to these aims, the nature of the tenure provided to appointees must ensure the following: An adequate term of office; removal before expiration of term only for cause specified in the relevant legislation; adequate removal procedures; proper processes to establish grounds for removal protection from pressure from Ministers, members of parliament and senior officials; reasonable opportunity to perform their work, so long as they are able to do so; and appropriate salaries and conditions of service. For their part, members of the tribunals should remain independent from party political activity and should observe the same standards of decorum and behaviour that judges have traditionally followed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee has concluded that the Parliament should not support a constitutional amendment to limit its power to abolish tribunals. However, the Committee has recommended that the following principles be borne in mind when the Parliament is considering the abolition of a tribunal: Abolition of a tribunal should not be used as a method of removing the holder of a quasi-judicial office; legislation to change the structure and jurisdiction of a tribunal should, if possible, refrain from abolishing the tribunal; when a tribunal is abolished or restructured, all existing members should be reappointed to its replacement; and when a tribunal is abolished and not replaced, compensation should be paid to members of the tribunal who have lost their place and for whom no alternative position can be found. The Committee has recommended that further consideration be given to embodying these principles in an Act of Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee was required to consider whether sections 24 and 28 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 provided proper and adequate tenure for presidential members and commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Committee concluded that, subject to the recommendations that I have just outlined in relation to the abolition of tribunals, the provisions did provide proper and adequate tenure to those appointees.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee considered the difficult question of whether there was a right to perform work attached to the appointment to a particular office. The Committee recognised that the head of a tribunal should have the power to allocate work to tribunal members but has indicated its belief that this power should not be exercised in such a way as to effect the de facto suspension of a member. The Committee concluded that when a tribunal member is deprived of work, the member is entitled to receive reasons for this occurring from the president of the tribunal. If the member does not accept the reasons the member should, in the first place, attempt to resolve the dispute with the tribunal president. If this does not work, the member should pursue whatever other legal avenues are available. The Committee concluded that there was no need for the establishment of a new body to deal with complaints against tribunal members, nor was it necessary for such a body to mediate between tribunal members and presiding officers.
      </para>
      <para>
       In chapter 8 of the report, the Committee deals with various issues raised by the case of former Justice Staples. In this respect, I note that the Committee refers to the individual concerned as `former' Justice Staples on the basis that he was formerly a Justice of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Committee does not wish to pre- judge the current status of the individual, which it understands to be a matter of some contention.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee was unable to reach any conclusions on the relationship which developed between former Justice Staples, on the one hand, and Sir John Moore and Justice Maddern, respectively, on the other. While the Committee received a detailed submission and heard former Justice Staples at length in its public hearing, it received no assistance from Sir John Moore or Justice Maddern on the difficult question of the relationship which developed between them and former Justice Staples. The Committee regretted this.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee concluded that it should not inquire further into the reasons why former Justice Staples was removed from active work as to do so would have required a full-scale inquiry into the Staples case. This was clearly beyond the Committee's terms of reference. However, in the light of the Committee's recommendations contained in chapter 5 of the report, which address the question of what should happen when a tribunal is abolished, the Committee recommended that the Government should establish an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation to former Justice Staples, in view of his non-reappointment to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       I need to raise one further matter in relation to former Justice Staples. On 21 November 1989 the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives forwarded to the Committee a letter which each had received from former Justice Staples. The letter referred to three statements contained in an early draft of the Committee's report. Former Justice Staples complained to the Presiding Officers about these statements, alleging that they were untrue and seeking some redress in relation to them. Unfortunately, the key parts of these letters appeared in several newspapers on 21 November. These letters were available to the Committee at a scheduled meeting on the afternoon of 21 November.
      </para>
      <para>
       At that stage of its consideration of the draft report the Committee had not reached the sections of the report to which Staples had referred but objection had already been raised to the accuracy of some of these statements, which were based on a written submission which had been received by the Committee. In considering these sections in the ordinary course of its consideration of the report, the Committee decided to delete them for the reasons which had already been raised. Accordingly, the Committee was not influenced in its deliberations by the letter from former Justice Staples.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee was concerned that the contents of some parts of a draft report had, without the authorisation of the Committee, become available to former Justice Staples and that he had made use of the material by directing it to the Presiding Officers. The Committee was also concerned that some of the material contained in former Justice Staples' letters was obtained and published by newspapers. The Committee gave consideration to whether it should report these matters as a possible breach of privilege but has decided that, in the light of all the circumstances, it should not take the matter any further. The Committee would like to thank the staff of the Committee for their assistance, particularly Stephen Argument, who was brought into the task at a late stage and did an excellent job in difficult circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are just a couple of points I would like to make in conclusion. Much was made of a speech Justice Staples made in Adelaide at an industrial relations meeting, and a copy of that speech has been appended to the report. Central to that was a letter signed by, I believe, eight of the presiding officers. That letter was used later by Sir John Moore, who said when he handed it to Justice Staples, `You have lost the confidence of your colleagues'. The letter was a criticism of the speech he had made in Adelaide. I am pleased to report that the Committee has determined to include in its report a letter from Justice Gaudron, then a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and a signatory to the letter which somewhat contradicts the statement that Justice Staples had lost the confidence of his colleagues.
      </para>
      <para>
       Justice Gaudron later dissociated herself from the use that had been made of the letter in a letter of resignation from the Commission which stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not resile from that position [ie the disapproval of former Justice Staples' speech which was expressed in the letter]. However, I do not believe that the disapproval expressed either was or should have been a factor relevant to your decision to deprive Mr Justice Staples of panel responsibilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       With the benefit of hindsight, I now suspect that some of my colleagues may have foreseen the use which would be made of our expression of disapproval, a use not intended by me. Accordingly, I feel no longer able to maintain an association with you, them or the commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have therefore forwarded my resignation to the Governor-General to take effect from 31 May 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       She went on:
      </para>
      <para>
       I have selected the date so as to permit the delivery of certain decisions which I have reserved.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think that letter says a great deal and perhaps clears up the matter as to whether Justic Staples had lost the confidence of his colleagues, as alleged by the perpetrators who worked so assiduously against him and refused to give him work. I would like to thank the Committee, once again, for its assistance in this difficult task.

        -All the action on this report took place when it was tabled in the Senate some weeks back and there has been some comment in the press since then. But I want to make the point that the report of the Joint Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals has been brought down with a very large measure of agreement, indeed near unanimity in the context of somewhat complex terms of reference and an underlying issue relating to former Justice Staples about which there have been some very strong feelings. There is a dissenting report from the Chairman, the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), who was required to be overseas on parliamentary business for much of the period of the Committee's work, and Senator Dunn. But I stress that-as I understand it the honourable member for Prospect is here in the House to speak for himself-the dissent relates to the thrust of the argument in the report and not to any one of the 12 or more conclusions and recommendations set out in the report, as referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott).
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The only dissent from the actual conclusions and recommendations of the Committee is Senator Aulich's dissent from recommendation No. 12-it is printed with an asterisk-which states in paragraph 8.36 of the report:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Government should establish an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation for former Justice Staples in view of his non-reappointment to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       All other members of the Committee acceded to this recommendation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The plain fact of the matter is that former Justice Staples did-and that is where I put the emphasis-have the rank and title, status and tenure of a judge, yet he was arbitrarily dismissed, not reappointed, by the Hawke Government in the context of the changeover from the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to the Industrial Relations Commission. There is no getting around that simple fact. It should perhaps be explained that the Industrial Relations Commission is not a court under section 72 of the Constitution; therefore, former Justice Staples did not have the constitutional protection that would be enjoyed by an ordinary judge. So, in the circumstances of this dismissal and in terms of the principles that were enunciated and accepted by all members of the Committee in paragraph 5.27 of the report-it is recommendation 4 which is printed with an asterisk in the statement of conclusions and recommendations, and I will not read them out again because the honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to them in his speech-an issue of compensation is involved; hence recommendation 12 which I quoted.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, as I have said, Senator Aulich dissented on that one point.

       Because of the restrictions of time I conclude my remarks by expressing my appreciation, and I believe the appreciation of all members of the Committee, of the work of Senator Peter Durack, Deputy Chairman of the Committee. He took over the task of chairing the Committee in the unavoidable absence overseas of the Chairman and steered the Committee through to the all but unanimous report being tabled here today. I also commend the work of the Acting Secretary, Mr Stephen Argument, who took over the job at a difficult stage of the Committee's work.

        —Mr Deputy Speaker, because I have been away for some time I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as Chairman of Committees. I think it was an excellent choice, but I am sorry, for the reason without any reflection on the present Speaker, that Joan Child is no longer Speaker. As has been mentioned, I was at the United Nations for part of the drafting of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals but those who know me will be aware that this did not prevent me from having an input. I am one of those people who takes things fairly seriously and tries to get involved in the final preparation.

      <para>
       Let me give a quick explanation for my dissent, which really puts more emphasis on some of the points made in the Committee report. My main complaint in the Staples case is not the non-reappointment of Staples-though I feel that he should have been reappointed, or at least not removed by such an underhand method-but the behaviour of the former President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in not giving him any work.
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer to the fifth paragraph of my dissent. We cannot accept the proposition that a Tribunal member, who can be removed only by the method and for the reasons outlined in section 72 of the Constitution, can, de facto, be suspended arbitrarily by a senior Tribunal member. I emphasise that this applies not only in the case of the former Arbitration Commission or the Industrial Relations Commission but also-we were told-in the case of any court, apart from the High Court of Australia. Members of the High Court Bench are entitled to be present for any case although obviously, for practical purposes, they do not try to sit in on every case. But the senior member of any of the Commonwealth tribunals, in effect, can do things which this Parliament and the Executive Government cannot do. As honourable members would know, under section 72 of the Constitution we can remove people only after proven misbehaviour, and this has to be agreed by both Houses of Parliament; yet the President of the Industrial Relations Commission can do that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I emphasise again what I said in my dissenting report: there is no evidence that the then Mr Justice Staples made no serious attempt to resolve the problem. In fact, he has given evidence to the contrary and this has not been denied. I emphasise that this is important because the Committee reported it in the first instance. Obviously, everybody assumes that the presidents of tribunals and judges in general will behave in a rational manner and will discuss things, but I emphasise that this did not happen in this case. In fact, we consider it very surprising that, in reply to a request, Mr Justice Maddern emphasised that, with the help of statutory declarations by staff, he made no attempt to contact Staples to discuss any problems. I point out to the House this unbelievable behaviour by Maddern. We said to him that Staples had said he had tried to contact him on numerous occasions to find out why he did not get any work and why he had, de facto, been dismissed, although he was still receiving his pay. What did Mr Justice Maddern give the Committee in reply? He gave 600 pages of roneoed material that would have been sent to all members of the then Arbitration Commission and two statutory declarations from his staff saying that nothing else came from Mr Justice Maddern's office. There were no attempted phone calls and no attempts to write to Staples to organise a meeting or anything. Maddern confirmed completely Staples' allegation that he just ignored him. He made no attempt whatsoever to have any sort of discussion with Staples. I think that is ridiculous behaviour for the president of a tribunal.
      </para>
      <para>
       I emphasise that a member of a tribunal who is deprived of work is entitled to receive reasons from the president of the tribunal for such a decision. I cannot accept the proposition that a tribunal member who can be removed only by the method and for the reasons outlined in section 72 of the Constitution can de facto be suspended arbitrarily by the senior tribunal member. As I said in my dissent, Mr Justice Maddern dismissed Staples de facto without giving reasons. Neither the Government nor the Parliament would be able to do so. Such behaviour allows a president to act capriciously or to protect what in this particular case has been alleged to be the industrial relations club. I think that is a terrible way of behaving.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am not arguing that we would want to have lots of `Stapleses' on the Industrial Relations Commission, any more than I would argue that we would want a lot of `Klugmans' in the House of Representatives. I would argue that it does not hurt to have the odd one. Part of having a pluralist society and of having intelligent discussion is to have what some would argue in my case to be a devil's advocate and what in Staples's case was a raising of points. Those honourable members who were here or were involved in these sorts of discussions will remember that at one stage-I think in about 1979-it was decided that everybody's productivity had increased by 8 per cent. The implication was, by agreement between the unions, the Government and the Commission members apart from Staples, that it had to be found that there had been an 8 per cent increase in productivity. I have forgotten the particular case, but Staples found in a case that the productivity increase was different from 8 per cent, which seems a reasonable point. I cannot remember what happened on appeal.
      </para>
      <para>
       The important thing, surely, is that if one person behaves on a bench in a judicious manner rather than acting as a clerk, as most members of the Industrial Relations Commission and the former Arbitration Commission behave, they are just acting as rubber-stamping clerks. An agreement is made and they then rubber-stamp that agreement. I am not arguing that it is necessarily bad for Australia that they do that. I support the accord. I think it has been of tremendous benefit to the Australian economy. The point that has to be emphasised is that when we have such things as an accord it does not mean that we stop anybody else criticising the accord or pointing out problems in that sort of accord.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not want to get involved in the argument that is presently going on in the Labor Council of New South Wales but a similar sort of attempt is being made to say that once certain agreements have been made they should not be criticised. I always have reservations about any attempt at censorship, whether it is in a formal sense or in an informal sense which can often be just  as--

        —I am arguing that when one member of a particular bench, whether it is an industrial bench or another bench, raises points which other people do not want to have raised, for all kinds of reasons, there is an attempt at censorship. There is a de facto suspension of that particular member, as happened in this case. I have a problem with the part of the report which says:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       7.36 . . . the Committee concludes that a member of a tribunal who is deprived of work is entitled to receive reasons from the president of the tribunal for such a decision. If the member does not accept the decision, or the reasons for it, he or she should, in the first place, try to resolve the dispute with the tribunal president.
      </para>
      <para>
       It goes on to say that there is no need for a new body. What happens if the president does not give any reasons, as happened in this case, and says that if one does something in the first place there is no second place? What does one do? I think it has raised a problem. I do not necessarily have any solutions otherwise I would have put them forward. Hopefully it will make some members of the public aware of the fact that there was an attempt-a successful attempt-to bar from participating in the Arbitration Commission, and now in the Industrial Relations Commission, somebody who held different views or who took a more judicial approach to the matter than did the members of those commissions. Hopefully the rest of the legal profession and the rest of the Australian population will take note of the fact that this can happen in other jurisdictions. The president of a particular tribunal, as I said earlier, can de facto deprive any other member of the tribunal of any work.

       I thank the House for listening to me. I hope that this is not the last occasion on which I will speak in this chamber. If it is; I wish honourable members good luck. I hope somebody else will be elected to the chamber who will take my sort of line when I leave. I am afraid that, whilst I strongly support the lady who will be the Labor candidate for my seat, she does not necessarily share my views as to the function of a parliamentarian.

        —As I received part of the credit, or the blame, for setting up the Joint Select Committee on the Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals, it is appropriate that I should say something about it. Before doing so may I say several things with respect to the remarks made by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). Firstly, I think with respect, that that speech probably was his last speech in the Parliament. Secondly, I agree with virtually everything he said about this matter that is now under discussion. Thirdly, taking those two points together, it is true that the Parliament does need `Klugmans' in the same way that our industrial relations system from time to time needs `Stapleses'. Of course, the Hawkes cannot tolerate the Stapleses and that, as I will be elaborating on later, is the real reason which gave rise to the Staples question. There are some people, of whom the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is one, who simply cannot tolerate any criticism of institutions that they support and that they regard as valuable, one of which is the industrial relations establishment in this country.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I certainly wish the honourable member for Prospect well in whatever future career he seeks to pursue. The Parliament needs, with the greatest of respect, people like him in the same way in which the industrial relations system from time to time needs people like Staples. It is very unfortunate that people who stand out as gadflies and as devil's advocates so often are made the object of hatred and criticism and at the end of the day attempts are made to get rid of them by one means or another. This is exactly what has happened in the case that is presently before us.
      </para>
      <para>
       In returning to the report itself I want to make the point that although the honourable member for Prospect acted as Chairman of this Committee, and did a good job in that role, nevertheless a lot of the practical day to day work fell onto the shoulders of Senator Durack for the reason that the honourable member for Prospect was overseas, I think at the United Nations, during the latter stages of the Committee's deliberations. It is appropriate, therefore, to acknowledge the tremendous work done by Senator Durack and, of course, the other members of the Committee. I say that not simply to hand out praise but because it is a good report.

        —I appreciate that, as I am sure Senator Durack does. It is a report into an important subject, an important aspect of government administration. It is a substantial and sensible report and I can sympathise with many, if not all, of the conclusions reached by the Committee. The report deals with the problems associated with the holding of office by members of quasi-judicial tribunals-that is to say, not of courts but of bodies which perform semi-judicial functions-and the problem is: what sort of security of tenure do they have? Do they have permanent security of tenure as judges do? Do they have tenure at the behest and the gift of the Government? Can it be taken away? Can it be taken away for any cause, and if so for what cause? And more particularly, to bring it more sharply to a point, what guarantee do they have of the tenure of their office when the Government gets a bee in its bonnet and decides to abolish a tribunal, as it did when it abolished the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and replaced it with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission? All those problems are grappled with by the Committee in its report, and are dealt with sensibly and, I believe, responsibly.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Obviously, I do not intend to read out the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee, but I will refer to two of them because they are important. The first recommendation says that in order to perform their functions such tribunals need to be able to attract and have appointed to them people of superior talents and integrity to ensure that they will not be influenced in their decisions by outside or irrelevant considerations. In particular, the conclusion goes on to say that they should not be influenced in any way by the government of the day or any alternative government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recommendation 2 provides a number of things in terms of practicalities about the tenure of office of occupants of the quasi-judicial tribunals which are under consideration. One of the most important aspects of that recommendation is the proposition that occupants of these offices should not be removed before the expiration of their term, and that if they are removed before the expiration of their term it should only be for cause. In other words, they should not be removed for no reason, but only for a specific cause and that cause should be stated in legislation passed by the Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       The recommendation goes on to say that there should be adequate procedures. In other words, the Government should not simply be able to snap its fingers and try to have somebody removed from a tribunal; an adequate procedure must be followed. There is a provision in recommendation 2 to the effect that where grounds for removal have to be established, there must be a proper legal process for doing so. Again that supports the proposition that I have just been putting, namely, that it is not good enough for the Government to act on a whim and try to remove someone from a quasi-judicial tribunal; there has to be a ground for doing so. That ground must be contained in the law and a proper and due process must be followed before that person can be removed from the tribunal.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other provisions in the report relate to Mr Justice Staples, as he then was, and I will come to those in a minute. I just want to make this point: one would have thought that the Government would at least have been in a position to put those substantial propositions into practice at an early stage, but in fact the Government did not take very long to depart from the Committee's recommendations. It should be remembered that the Committee included members of the Australian Labor Party and also an Independent.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of the Inter-State Commission we have seen an apparently successful attempt by the Government to go against the principles set out in this report. It did not take the Government long to depart from the report's recommendations; it was done almost instantly. I say that because the Inter-State Commission was already established and the Government decided to establish a new body called the Industry Commission which would incorporate the Inter-State Commission. Of course, it is worse in this case because the Inter-State Commission was established under the Constitution. So we have a situation where a government has not been satisfied with the reports and recommendations of the Inter-State Commission and has set about its mind to answer the questions: How can we get rid of it? How can we get rid of the people who occupy the position of members of the Inter-State Commission?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government cannot get rid of the Inter-State Commission completely, because it is provided for in the Constitution. But what the Government can do is get rid of the members of that Commission. The way the Government has done that is exactly the way that it acted in the case of the industrial relations system. The Government has established a new body and has said to members of the Inter-State Commission, `Very well, you are now members of the Industry Commission'. Of course, one result of the Government's action is that members of that body no longer have the security of tenure which they had by virtue of being members of the Inter-State Commission. They had that protection because the Inter-State Commission was established under the Constitution.
      </para>
      <para>
       I make the point again, without labouring it, that here is a pretty clear series of recommendations from a bipartisan committee which says, in effect, that governments should not, without good cause, go fiddling around with the composition of quasi-judicial tribunals just to get their own way. The first time that a problem arose with respect to one such body-the Inter-State Commission-the Government went clean against the recommendations of this Committee. Frankly, the Government should wake up to itself and start to put into practice at an early date the sensible recommendations contained in the report.
      </para>
      <para>
       I move to the second matter under consideration in this area, that relating to Mr Justice Staples. Three recommendations in the report relate to Mr Justice Staples, as he then was. Firstly, the Committee was unable to reach any conclusion on the relationship that developed between former Justice Staples, on the one hand, and Sir John Moore and Justice Maddern, on the other. Secondly, the Committee concluded that it should not inquire further into the reasons why decisions were made to remove former Justice Staples from active work. The final recommendation-a decision which is clearly in favour of the former judge-was that the Government should establish an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation for Mr Justice Staples, as he then was.
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer to one of the conclusions in order to give more sense and understanding to the actual recommendations. It is important to remember that one of the conclusions-the honourable member for Prospect touched on this in his remarks-was that, on the evidence before the Committee, former Justice Staples was prepared at all times to carry out the duties of his office. Let us get that very clearly in our heads, because this was, in part, an inquiry into Staples-an inquiry into whether the vicious attack launched on him by the Government and the Prime Minister was justified or not. The burden of the Government's argument was always that this judge refused to carry out and did not carry out his duties. An inquiry was set up, submissions were called for, a lot of evidence was given and witnesses came forward.
      </para>
      <para>
       What did the Committee conclude on the basis of all the evidence it had? It concluded that Staples was at all times prepared to carry out the duties of his office. Until there is any evidence to the contrary I hope we do not hear the Prime Minister or anyone else saying that Staples was not reappointed to the new Industrial Relations Commission because he was not prepared to carry out his duties on the old Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This Committee has found, on the evidence open to it, that this is not true. It also found that he `was prevented from doing so by decisions of the President of the day'. After an inquiry into it there is the answer to the Staples problem: he was stopped from performing his duties by the President of the day.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no doubt that the Government has ended up with egg on its face over the Staples argument. The Government has in effect lost this argument because the allegation was made-particularly by the Prime Minister and by the then Minister for Industrial Relations-that Staples was no good and that he was removed for that reason and because he was not performing his duties. That allegation has been rejected by the Committee. Nothing has been found against Staples in this report, but-to echo the honourable member for Prospect-a fair bit was found by the Committee against two Presidents of the Arbitration Commission, which should give everyone very grave cause for concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       I emphasis to the Government that the Committee has recommended that a committee should be established to determine compensation. I emphasise that Mr Justice Staples has now written to the Prime Minister asking the Government to implement this report and that recommendation. I hope the Government does and tries to save, with as much grace as it can muster, whatever dignity is left in this matter. The Government lost this argument; the least it can do now is to show some decency and pay up. It is about time that it realises that this is what it has to do. I hope it has at least got the decency to take this matter in hand and act responsibly-it will be the first time in this whole matter that it has.

Sport has been bought, but it has to realise that there is a price. Sport has to ensure that it is the best price. For government funds that price is accountability. For sponsorship by the corporate sector the price is recognition and promotion. In the report we have outlined some of the reasons for sponsorship. The report which I have tabled should contribute to the discussion in the community about the funding of sport and, in particular, the sponsorship of sport.

       In March of this year I tabled our first report, Going for Gold. That report was accepted by Government and its main theme-that the forward estimates were unacceptable-has been acknowledged. Instead of an allocation of $23.6m in the 1989-90 Budget, sport was given $42.9m with significant increases over the coming four years. One of the themes of this report is accountability-accountability to the Australian people for the funds allocated. The increase in funds is not without conditions-the sports that receive the funds are accountable for those funds. We have referred to the objectives of the Australian Sports Commission and recommended that, as part of the accountability process, the objectives be reported on in the annual report.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additional funds are to be provided to national sporting organisations by the Commonwealth. Not only are these organisations accountable for funds; the association members must also contribute through capitation fees. The Commonwealth must not be an alternative source of funds to the members' own contributions. During the inquiry the members of the Committee were able to inspect a number of sporting venues including the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Superdome in Western Australia and the National Tennis Centre.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, a feature of the inspections was a visit to the Deception Bay sportsground in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) where a number of sports share the facilities and the clubhouse. This is the type of local development that should be encouraged. The community recreation and sport facilities program is a Commonwealth initiative but requires a matching grant by State or local government. It has provided $13m for the construction of facilities, but these funds were able to cover only 200 of the 1,100 applications received. The Committee has recommended that the program should continue.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee has endorsed the comment made in the first report about funding for elite athletes. Australia cannot fund every sport at the elite level, and by that I mean by a residential program at the Australian Institute of Sport. There must be a maximum of 25 sports and these sports should be subject to regular review for continued access to the Australian Institute of Sport. The Committee has also looked at participation, particularly in relation to women and the disabled. We have noted the increased funding initiatives and acknowledged that it is too early to assess those initiatives. I understand that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is looking at the issue of women's access to sport and I will be interested to read its findings.
      </para>
      <para>
       The issue which dominated this inquiry was that of sponsorship by tobacco and alcohol companies. The report, therefore, is timely in view of the fact that legislation with regard to tobacco advertising is coming before this place later today. The Committee is required, under its terms of reference, to look at alternative sources of funding for sport. Tobacco accounts for about $20m of an estimated $90m of sponsorship of sport. That $20m compares with $30m by the breweries. A number of non-smoking organisations, tobacco companies and breweries took the opportunity to put their views before the Committee. Many people feel passionately about the topic of smoking and we have endeavoured to summarise their concerns in the report. It has been suggested that 18,000 Australians die as a result of smoking yet approximately four million Australians continue to smoke. There are also 6,000 deaths due to alcohol, yet many Australians continue to imbibe it.
      </para>
      <para>
       There were a number of references to public opinion. These served only to confuse the issue and the conflicting survey results merely reinforce the Committee's view that there is no simple solution to the tobacco sponsorship issue. Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the surveys of public opinion on tobacco were of dubious value and that it appears that the results of surveys could be contrived by variables such as the phrasing of the survey questions, the audience targeted and, indeed, the interests of the organisation commissioning the survey. We have stated our concerns about not only tobacco but also alcohol. We would have preferred a more even-handed approach by some of the organisations that appeared before us.
      </para>
      <para>
       A matter of real concern is the hypocrisy involved in the comparisons in the treatment of alcohol and tobacco. The Committee is most concerned that some of the philosophies and activities of health foundations could be regarded as hypocritical. The Committee was disturbed by the foundations being so adamant about banning all tobacco advertising, and indeed some anti-smoking groups even lobbying for the banning of tobacco consumption, while, at the same time, they maintained a complacent attitude towards alcohol advertising and consumption. The Committee was also dismayed that the foundations, while purporting to be unrelenting advocates of the tobacco sponsorship ban, were prepared, nevertheless, to succumb to ban exemptions. Such exemptions appear to have been granted to sports activities perceived to be more popular. This appeared to the Committee to be a case of `when is a ban not a ban?'. In South Australia tobacco advertising is banned except for the cricket and the grand prix, the major events on the sporting calendar. In Western Australia cricket and horseracing are exempt. The Australian Capital Territory has proposed a ban on tobacco advertising as well, but also with exemptions, namely, the Winfield Cup for rugby league and the Prime Minister's XI for cricket.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee does not dispute the damage caused by tobacco and alcohol. In fact, we concluded that the consumption of tobacco by Australians, particularly young Australians, is a cause for concern, as is the consumption of alcohol. However, the Committee does not support prohibition of tobacco or alcohol. Such a prohibition is unlikely to be accepted by the Australian community. The community should, however, be aware of the concerns expressed by medical experts. They should also be concerned about the indirect costs of the antisocial behaviour that results from the excess consumption of alcohol. Australians must be persuaded not to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol to excess rather than being prevented from doing so.
      </para>
      <para>
       A proposal for the establishment of a Commonwealth health promotion foundation was suggested to the Committee. A 5c levy on a packet of cigarettes would raise $68m. The Committee did not endorse the proposal, because it combines two issues, a tax on tobacco to discourage consumption and a campaign against consumption which is dependent for funding on that consumption. It would also duplicate much of the work of the Drug Offensive. The Committee also suggested that the Drug Offensive could be more involved in sport promotion. This year only about $350,000 of the $30m allocated to the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse was for sport sponsorship. As I noted earlier, the tobacco companies spend $20m. The Victorian Health Promotion Fund has some $23m each year at its disposal but of that, only $7m goes to sport.
      </para>
      <para>
       The inquiry into sport has been a most rewarding one. It was, I consider, a catalyst for change in sports funding. I hope it will draw accountability to the attention of sports administrators. In regard to tobacco sponsorship, I trust that we have assisted to promote a more reasoned debate. The Government has proposed a ban on the advertising of tobacco products in the print media. This report will assist in the discussion and consideration of the proposed legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I thank members of the Subcommittee who worked tirelessly over the last several months to prepare the report that has been tabled in the Parliament today. I believe that the five or six of us who make up the Subcommittee which examined this matter are probably now the most expert group of parliamentarians anywhere in Australia on sport, sports funding and sports administration. We were not, as a group, able to come to a consensus view on alcohol and tobacco sponsorship of sport and so on, as I have indicated in the report. Nevertheless, as a group we have worked particularly well together.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also thank the members of the Committee staff, in particular Phil Bergin and Vicki Brown who are in the chamber now; and Amanda Garlick and Sharon Fisher. The dedication of the staff of the Finance and Public Administration Committee is exemplary and they deserve the Parliament's highest praise. I also thank the printers in the building, after the very late notice that they received of this report's tabling, for doing such an excellent job to get it prepared so we could table it today.
      </para>
      <para>
       I conclude by saying that this is a very valuable report in its contribution to understanding problems about sponsorship in sport and the broader question of participation in sport. I recommend the report to every member of the House and indeed to every member of the Australian community who has an interest in sport. It is a companion volume to our first report on elite sport in this country and is, in my view, considerably worthwhile reading for anyone who has an interest in these topics.

        —by leave-I am pleased to speak on the tabling of the second report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on an inquiry into sports funding and administration entitled Can Sport be Bought? I support the comments of the Chairman, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), about the role of the Committee which, comprising members of both sides of the Parliament, Government and Opposition, has acted, as he said, as a catalyst for change in sports funding and administration. It has led to some useful Government initiatives that would have Opposition support. It is relevant as to the role of committees in this place. Before this debate we talked about the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals. The role of committees in the Parliament is important not only in checking the Executive but in contributing to debate about issues.

       This report deals with the debate about the tobacco sponsorship issue but before I move on to that, I want to talk about sports administration itself. My observation, which I think is probably shared by most of my colleagues, is that, as the Chairman said, we on this Committee have knowledge, because of the inquiry that we have had, that perhaps does not exist anywhere else in the Parliament. There is a general rule that the better the administration of a particular sport the better the competitive results will be amongst elite athletes in Australia. If we have good administration and good coordination between athletes and administrators, we will get more medals at Commonwealth and Olympic games. There are obviously exceptions to that rule but it is a general principle, and I think we have seen a lifting of the standards in Australia. There were some Fraser Government initiatives regarding the Australian Institute of Sport. I think this Committee has played a very valuable role and history will judge its role as a most important one in the administration of sport in Australia.

       I move on to the tobacco sponsorship debate. I think this report restores some balance to the debate and acknowledges that there is a debate on the issue. There has been give and take by members of the Committee from both sides and the views do not unanimously reflect party affiliation. But an issue of freedom is involved in tobacco sponsorship-in fact, in the smoking issue-and we have to be very careful in measures such as the legislation that will come before the House later today. I cannot speak on that now. We have to be careful about going down roads to prohibit legal substances, notwithstanding any other issues involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       As to the report itself and the tobacco sponsorship issue, let me refer briefly to one or two items in the report. The report refers to the loss of the motorcycle grand prix at Phillip Island in Victoria and to the negotiations concerning signage at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the international cricket series taking place this summer. At one stage it seemed likely that that international series would not go ahead because of problems with that signage. Undoubtedly the Victorian Government, because of its legislation and its attitude, lost the motorcycle grand prix to New South Wales. As a Victorian, I believe that is to be regretted.

        —I have received support from the honourable member for Corangamite in relation to that issue. But in discussing that issue we must look at the situation in other countries. It is all very well for us in Australia-or in Victoria, let us say-to have a purist view about the issue. Australia is not in isolation and Victoria and South Australia are not in isolation. The report refers to the situation in other countries and to suggestions that Australia would lose a number of major sporting events if tobacco sponsorship were banned. We live in the real world and deal with other countries in the region. Many international sports allocate, say, one, two or three events to a particular region of the world, which would be the Asia-Pacific region in our case.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       If we are not careful we will lose many international sporting events altogether if we go down the road of enacting some of the types of legislation that are being introduced in the States. That is of great concern to Australia in an international competitive environment because events such as motorcycle and motor vehicle grand prix create export dollars, tourism and revenue for Australia. I have referred to grand prix in other countries. We have to live in a real competitive world in the environment around us.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us move on to the role of health foundations. We looked at the issue of whether there should be a Commonwealth health foundation. The Committee does not support the establishment of a Commonwealth health foundation funded by a tax on cigarette sales. We looked at some of the State foundations that exist, and in paragraph 7.20 we refer to the Victorian Calder Park Thunderdome motor raceway. The report states:
      </para>
      <para>
       In one particular project, the Victorian Raceway, it was contended that the sport did not benefit, rather it was the owner of the raceway.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee sought comments from the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation about the amount and terms and conditions of that buy-out. As we said in the report, comments were sought and the Health Foundation advised that it would not provide full details of the buy-outs. I think it is of great concern that in the State a statutory corporation-a quango-has been incorporated on a legislative basis with bipartisan support but has refused to give a Commonwealth parliamentary committee full details of a buy-out. These health foundations have to be accountable and it is unacceptable that they are not. The Committee goes on to refer to that matter.

It is pleasing to see the Leader of the Opposition in the House; he is very interested in sport, including windsurfing and horseracing, as he has mentioned. The Committee report also deals with Victorian health foundations. I remain unconvinced that the foundation approach to sports funding has proved itself. As I said a few seconds ago, I have great concerns about the failure of the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation to provide details of buy-outs. I am unconvinced that buying out a particular raceway or a particular league football club will contribute to the endeavours, aims and objectives of the health foundation. In fact, I think it can be counterproductive and can only put up the price of sports sponsorship.

       I would make one observation in relation to sport, especially cricket: we have to be careful in discussing these items. I have said we should not throw out the baby with the bath water and go overboard by going down the sorts of roads that can eventually lead to prohibition in this and other areas. I think in a quiet way over many years, the Rothmans Foundation has made a great contribution to sports funding and sport in Australia. It was a quite discrete body, headed by a former distinguished great Australian sportsman and cricketer Alan Davidson. It cannot now even put its logo on sporting literature. That is the state of stupidity we have got to in this debate. I do not think the Rothmans Foundation harms or has harmed anybody.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will conclude by referring to sports management. As I said at the outset, the better the administration and the better the management the better the results for sport itself. We are seeing now growth of courses and training of administrators in sports. I was particularly impressed by the Bayswater Faculty of Business from the Victoria State College, which gave evidence to the Committee, and which is developing another program which will not duplicate other programs. In fact, it put together for the Committee a summary of the eight institutions in this country that have recognisable administration strands or sports management units in their business programs. I think the growth of the sports management programs in tertiary institutions is to be encouraged.

       I thank the House for its time. I think the comments made by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) in the previous debate were valuable. His role and the role of others like him in this House are what the Parliament needs for the future.

        —by leave-I would like to support the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) and the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), in the tabling of this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into sports funding and administration, particularly at a time when Melbourne is seeking to host the Olympic Games in 1996. I think it is appropriate that the premier stadium is depicted on the front cover of this report, not so much as that will be the venue for the 1996 Olympic Games, but it draws to the attention of this House and the Australian public the dilemmas that faced the Committee. On the one hand we had the Quit program and on the other hand we had an advertising program that supported the consumption of alcohol.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Chairman alluded to the very hardworking Committee and I support those remarks. The Committee endeavoured to look at the funding for elite athletes, and the Going for Gold report was very well received around Australia by elite athlete organisations. I think it set the tone and attitudes for funding by governments and the way in which the whole matter of funding of supreme elite athletes should be undertaken.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn now to the basic thesis of the second report. To get elite athletes in position we have to ensure a wide range of participation in sport by children, young adults, women, the disabled and older people so that, on the one hand, their health can be enhanced and, on the other hand, we can look for young talent to develop to the elite level.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because time is short, I would like to refer to a couple of items that have been incorporated in the report. I was particularly impressed, as were other members of the Committee, with the Aussie sports program that has been developed. Manuals which have been developed carefully modify some aspects of Australian sporting activity and allow teachers and coaches to adapt sporting activity to suit particular individuals. I was particularly impressed with some exhibits that we saw and with people we spoke to who were prepared to use minimum amounts of sporting gear thereby cutting down the capital costs involved. We saw some very good examples of this on some of our visits. We were particularly impressed with the way in which the sports fun program was undertaken in Western Australia, the home State of the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), where young students were teaching other young students, thereby developing a pool of talent in the umpiring, teaching, and coaching area. Sometimes there were modified programs for tennis, hockey and other ball games so, over time, a pool of talent would be developed. We were very impressed with the enthusiasm and response of those students we spoke to on that occasion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other honourable members have spoken about the funding. Again I support the remarks of the Chairman that the Going for Gold report influenced the Government quite considerably in allocating $42m to elite athlete programs in 1989-90 and a further $54m for the next financial year. Our report suggests, from the figures that we can find, that local government contributes about 73 per cent to the funding of local sporting activity-some $900m to the facilities of all Australian cities and country areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other important factor that has emerged in the funding of elite athletes is the reduction in Federal Government funding of 110 sports down to 15 to 25 sports, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the money that has been allocated.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to comment on the sponsorship argument between tobacco and alcohol and the relativity of funding by the Federal, State and local governments. Of course, the arguments that are put forward in this report revolve very much around the role of sponsorship by tobacco companies and, to a lesser degree, the alcohol companies. Reference has been made to the anomalies that have emerged as the Australian Grand Prix in South Australia has been exempted from these sponsorship bans. Likewise, reference has been made to the strong arguments relating to the grand prix motorcycle upset in Victoria because of sponsorship by tobacco companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The real dilemma facing the Government and this Parliament is that the government of the day receives over one billion dollars worth of revenue from tobacco products. Four million Australians smoke for good or for bad reasons and, unfortunately, about 20,000 die annually. Of course, emerging from these arguments and medical evidence is the fact that advertisers have been subjected to strong criticism. Debate later in the day will concentrate on the effect of advertising on children and young adults. In my view, it is not clear that advertising is the key influence on whether people smoke or whether young adults or young children take up smoking. There are others such as peer group pressure, the image and brand loyalties. The general feeling in the community is that senior people who smoke influence younger persons in our community.
      </para>
      <para>
       The issue of incidental advertising again took the attention of the Committee. We are suggesting that there be no complete ban on incidental advertising. We see great problems. We are very aware of the freedom of Australian people to advertise legal products and, at this stage, we are suggesting that there be no complete ban on incidental advertising because that would lead to considerable legal problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would just like to draw the attention of the House to figures which put in some perspective the problems caused by alcohol, tobacco and other drugs in 1987. I think the whole argument about the Drug Offensive-tobacco and alcohol-is somewhat out of proportion, especially when one looks at the deaths resulting from the taking of these drugs and the anti-social behaviour that emerges from excess consumption of alcohol. In 1987, 6,600 people died from alcohol. Tobacco products caused the death of 18,000 persons; opiates, 323 persons; barbiturates, 85 persons; and other drugs, 301 persons. We see from these figures a clearer perspective of death rates from hard drugs, alcohol and tobacco. In our society we have a certain hypocrisy-and the report refers to that-where, on the one hand, we are prepared to argue strongly for the banning of tobacco advertising; yet, on the other hand, we are prepared to tolerate vast amounts of advertising for alcohol products. The front page of our report indicates the hypocrisy that we see in this arena. Some interesting comments have been made by witnesses as to the consumption of alcohol, the effects that that might have and-what they see as a reasonably good thing-that alcohol does not cause as many deaths as smoking . My view is that alcohol causes anti-social behaviour and major problems in Australian homes and Australian society. That is not a reportable statistic. The Committee debated long and hard on this issue. I wish to draw that to the attention of the House in this very vexed debate about tobacco products and alcohol.
      </para>
      <para>
       I finish by drawing the attention of the House to a comment made by Mr Brian Tobin from Tennis Australia, who is well known to many Australians. His comment to the Committee made me aware that, compared with other countries, we enjoy a remarkable number of facilities in our country towns and regional cities in the form of cricket and football grounds, bowling clubs, golf courses and tennis courts. Nearly every country area or small country town enjoys those facilities and this can be compared with their availability in other nations. Even in my own electorate of Corangamite and my own home town, the little, local Bookar cricket club has a small cricket activity on a back paddock. It is one of the most vigorous cricket clubs in the local competition. It is a self-help operation. It has done its own thing. It did not have the best facilities that were available and, what is more, it did not have government assistance. This report reflects the general view that Australians like participating in sport and that there should be funding from all sources to ensure that Australians enjoy a healthy lifestyle, and supports the general proposition that if a large number of people participate-from young school children to older pensioners-Australia will be a better, healthier nation. What is more, we will then get a pool of athletes who will be potential gold medal winners. I thank members of the Committee and members of the staff for a very interesting report. It is a very good guide to future governments for the way in which sports funding should be handled in Australia in the future.

        —I was honoured to lead a delegation that was characterised by a bipartisan and disciplined approach of all members. We felt this was important and I claim that the success of the visit can be very much attributed to the fact that members of all parties contributed effectively to the delegation's work. In fact, we agreed, at a pre-departure meeting, that we ought to say that we represented Australia first and foremost rather than our particular political parties-particularly when dealing with such forums as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In this regard I would like to pay a particular tribute to Senator David Hamer, the deputy delegation leader, for his assistance and unfailing cooperation. David was an excellent deputy and he made some very significant contributions, particularly in Rome. In addition, I thank the other members who worked diligently to guarantee the success of the visit-Senators Maguire and Aulich; the honourable member for Calwell, Dr Theophanous; the honourable member for Wannon, Mr Hawker; and the honourable member for Kennedy, Mr Bob Katter. Due to pressures of business in Australia both I and Senator Hamer had to return early and the delegation was led by the honourable member for Calwell with the honourable member for Wannon as the deputy leader. They continued what we regarded as effective work up to that point.

       Before proceeding further it is necessary to acknowledge some of the people in the background, particularly Kieran Schneemann, Siobhan Ni Fhaolain and Cheryl Samuels from the Parliamentary Relations Office, and, from the Parliamentary Library, Dennis Argall and Frank Frost. I would also like to thank the staff of the House of Representatives printing unit for the professional printing of this report-it was completed in record time-and Sue Cox, who typed all the draft reports. I should also particularly acknowledge Michael Salkeld, who was a great secretary to the delegation. One of the pleasing things this year is that-given that we visited Europe in September-October-we are presenting the report now, as it is important to advise the Parliament as soon as possible on the outcome of a delegation's visit. I also thank Bertha Williamson, my secretary. Michael and Bertha did all the very difficult work-all the running around-and made sure that things worked as they needed to.
      </para>
      <para>
       Perhaps, by painting a picture, I can describe to the House the circumstances that confronted us. At the moment we are seeing a lot of film on our television screens of people with candles protesting in Wenceslas Square in Prague on behalf of freedom, and people crossing the border between East and West Berlin, going from East Germany to West Germany. Many people find these pictures very encouraging and very heartening, and I think members of this Parliament share that view. The developments in eastern Europe are dramatic and have long term significance.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other picture I need to paint refers to the developments in western Europe. The best way to describe those is to talk in terms of western Europe, from 1992, being a single market for goods. Australians should think of countries such as Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Spain and West Germany as belonging to one market in the same way that Australian States belong to one country. If we can think in terms of those countries trading freely with no customs barriers, no differences in the laws of business and no differences in the ways that business codes and regulations operate, we can understand a community of that kind, and recognise that it, along with Japan and the United States of America, will be a huge economic entity by 1992. In eastern Europe there are dramatic changes on the political agenda and, in western Europe, dramatic changes in the political and economic agendas. In a moment I will say what that means for Australians.
      </para>
      <para>
       When honourable members focus upon our visit to the North Atlantic Assembly and our briefing with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation officials in Brussels, they should bear in mind that NATO was set up as an alliance to counter the Warsaw Pact forces led by the Soviet Union. We are now facing a circumstance where the Warsaw Pact, and its role as both a defensive and potentially offensive alliance in eastern Europe, has been reduced in terms of its military commitment and, certainly, its political commitment. What does it mean for NATO? One of the questions the delegation put was: Is it possible to foresee a Europe in which there is an alliance, such as NATO, to confront the Warsaw Pact when there is no longer any effective Warsaw Pact? That is one of the realities that we have to address.
      </para>
      <para>
       The implications for Australia and the world are quite dramatic. I will continue to paint the picture. The first observation is the potential for people in the West, including Australia, to trade with the burgeoning market in eastern Europe. The second observation is that, if the reality of the political changes in Europe is to be seen for what it is, we can spend a lot more money on economic matters, aid and development and a lot less on defence. Putting all of those things together, a visit to Europe by an Australian parliamentary delegation has great significance because it has occurred at the time of all these changes. Europe in 1992 will see the development of an integrated market and far-reaching changes in eastern Europe, none of which can be anticipated. Even the NATO officials, when the delegation met them in September and October of this year, could not then foresee East Germany, Czechoslovakia or Bulgaria changing their political arrangements. Yet, in the space of two months, the whole infrastructure of those political arrangements has collapsed. We are talking about dramatic events.
      </para>
      <para>
       As far as Australia is concerned, three or four elements ought to be emphasised. The first is that we wanted to emphasise very clearly to the Europeans-my colleague the honourable member for Wannon will say more about this, I imagine-the importance to us of agricultural exports, agricultural subsidies and the difficulties of entering markets that are subsidised. We had discussions with Commissioner MacSharry and I want to acknowledge that the delegation was very pleased to have had that access to Commissioner MacSharry and Commissioner Andriessen. The important thing to emphasise is that the Europeans at that point certainly gave no ground. Despite all their assurances, in political terms they said, `Look, we are stuck with a political agenda. We have many farmers who are relatively poor, particularly in places like Portugal and southern Italy. We are not about to try to sell those out in terms of the needs of farmers in Australia'. But we put the case, and the case was put very well by Senator Hamer in one meeting we had when he said, `I want to say to Europeans that we in Australia can slaughter a steer and put it on a first-class seat on a Qantas Airways Ltd flight to Europe and get it into Europe at a cheaper price than you can produce that steer in Europe'. That was a very good analogy, because it enabled us to make them focus on the circumstances. We were very pleased to be able to get some amendment to the OECD report relating to agriculture.
      </para>
      <para>
       We were pleased that the OECD report included an amendment which recognised overall tariff reductions in the Uruguay Round. That is the second point to emphasise. I think the third point to emphasise, which is also very important is that Australia is regarded in Europe as a good citizen in environmental terms. There is a lot of debate on this matter within Australia, and we have heard a lot of nonsense from State governments about world heritage-and one of those governments, the former Queensland Government, has gone the way of all governments that do not face up to reality. A lot of nonsense is talked by State governments about the environment, usually for their own domestic political reasons. It is nonsense when we look at it in world terms, because what the Europeans were saying to us was, `What are you doing about the environment? What are you doing about the ozone layer? What are you doing about greenhouse gas emissions?'
      </para>
      <para>
       We talked to them about the issue of land degradation, because Europeans regard land degradation as a low priority and we regard it as a very high priority. The fact is that, from a European perspective of millions of people, particularly in a very small country such as the Netherlands, which is subject to high levels of air pollution, water pollution and drinking water pollution, let alone other forms of chemical pollution in the soil, the Europeans see us as an island continent which is relatively unpolluted, relatively unpopulated, but with the opportunity to set the pace for the rest of the world. It is important to say to all Australians: forget for a minute the question of our political alliances and begin to think in terms of our responsibility as a country to the rest of the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is very telling to meet someone like Dr Alain Bombard-who not only sailed a raft for six weeks to prove that one can stay afloat at sea and survive but also swam the English Channel, and who is a strong environmentalist. He has said as a French member of the European Parliament, `I oppose nuclear testing in the Pacific; I support what you are doing on Antarctica'. His is a voice that we ought to recognise, not in terms of our own partisan political reasons but in terms of the way we see the world, because the young people of Australia and the young people of the world will not thank us if we fail to recognise environmental concerns.
      </para>
      <para>
       I emphasise that we talked about land degradation which, of course, for some members in this place is a very important issue, but we also talked about what we are doing to protect the ozone layer, greenhouse gas emissions, the protection of forests, and so on. It is very disturbing, when one visits Europe, to have pointed out to one the Black Forest. Incidentally, one cannot see the forest very well because many of the trees do not have many leaves left on them, and also the area is so dirty that one really cannot see the forest from four kilometres away. That is a very telling point for Australians.
      </para>
      <para>
       To sum up, the visit to Europe by a delegation was absolutely important and, having regard to the tide of change in Europe, it is even more important to be part of that process. I am very optimistic about what I see happening in both eastern and western Europe. I am also very optimistic about the fact that Australia can play a part in that process. There are trade opportunities and some very significant benefits for Australia. We have to keep knocking at the door of the common agricultural policy, and I believe we can do a lot in that area. At the same time we can provide considerable leadership for the rest of the world on a number of levels, regarding chemical weapons treaties, initiatives on Cambodia or initiatives on the environment. These matters do not have to be partisan political matters. What we were able to establish clearly in the minds of the Europeans was that members from both sides and both Houses of the Australian Parliament could come to a joint position. I found it very satisfying that members of the delegation made joint contributions about these important issues and could say to the Europeans, `We do feel very strongly about that'.
      </para>
      <para>
       On behalf of the delegation-the senators and members, and Mike Salkeld, Bertha Williamson and the people who worked in the background-I say that we were very pleased with the outcome of the visit. I conclude by saying that Christmas is the time of year when we wish one another peace. Having visited Europe at this time, I think I can say more firmly than ever before in my lifetime-which is now 44 years-that because of what is happening in eastern and western Europe, we are closer to real peace than we have ever been; and that is probably the best gift we can give future generations both in Australia and in the rest of the world.

        —by leave-As a member of the delegation, I would like to endorse everything that the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) has said. It was a very worthwhile opportunity for members to visit the European institutions. I take up one of the last points that the honourable member for Stirling made. It was very encouraging to see bipartisan work being done by members of the delegation, not only for the benefit of Australia but also for the benefit of our hosts. That work gave a very clear indication to the people that we visited of our interest, our concerns, and that we were representing our country-and representing it, I believe, in a way that all honourable members would be very proud of. The leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Stirling, emphasised the significance of the visit and, I guess, implicitly emphasised the importance of continuing these visits. I am sure that not only the members themselves gained from the experience but also Australia gained, because by having members of our Parliament visit those institutions we had an opportunity to make sure that decision makers in Europe are well aware of our points of view.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In the short time available to me this morning, I will concentrate on one or two aspects that the honourable member for Stirling mentioned and refer to them in a little more detail. In particular, our efforts at the Council of Europe resulted in some significant changes to the draft resolution of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Development relating to the annual report on activities of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Council was prepared to accept and adopt a number of amendments initiated by the Australian delegation and I felt that was most encouraging. Four amendments related to agriculture, one to trade and one to the environment. I think the important message that we were trying to get across was that we are very concerned that the Europeans take moves to reduce protection for their agriculture at a rate that we believe is reasonable. I say `reasonable', because I think we accept that the Europeans are not going to change everything overnight. Nonetheless, as the report by the Secretary-General of the OECD did highlight, efforts to date have been very limited. The seriousness of the position could probably be underlined by the following words used in the report by the Secretary-General:
      </para>
      <para>
       Despite some improvement in the situation for certain commodities, serious and acute problems remain. As was stressed in other reports prepared by the Secretariat in 1988, this improvement should provide no argument for delaying the reform of those domestic policies that create trade distortions in the agricultural sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was also pointed out in the report:
      </para>
      <para>
       The past period was characterised by high levels of assistance for the OECD as a whole . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       That was particularly so in agricultural areas but, I guess most disturbingly, the point made was that, while there have been some reductions, these were due mainly to the North American drought and its effects on prices, rather than to any adjustment policies. The report went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       The analysis of assistance levels confirms that the reform of agricultural policies to which Ministers are committed remains urgent and has yet to take place.
      </para>
      <para>
       I emphasise the words `has yet to take place'. These were the points that we wanted to make and place on the record, along with our concern about some progress in, and we hope a successful outcome for, the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations that are currently continuing. The other point was to bring home to our friends in Europe the importance of environmental issues. We had their acceptance to include in part of the report to the Council that the environmental implications of economic activity should be included in any economic assessment and also to realise the global impact of those decisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second point that the honourable member alluded to was our meeting with the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr MacSharry. As our report points out, the best way to summarise our briefing is to describe it as providing an optimistic picture of Europe 1992 but this optimism for Europe is not one that can be shared by Australia. Members of the Australian Parliament have been going to Europe for some years now to try repeatedly to make the point that the level of assistance that is given to agriculture in Europe not only is very harmful for other countries, and in particular Australia, but also in fact defies logic. It is extremely expensive, and, if it is done purely on an economic basis to support the farming sector, there would be much cheaper ways of doing it. But of course we have to accept, as others have had to accept, that these are political decisions and political decisions do not always look at the overall economic situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I conclude by commending the report and, in particular, endorsing the words of the honourable member for Stirling. I thank my colleagues for the way the whole delegation was kept running smoothly and also commend the leadership of the honourable member for Stirling who did an outstanding job. I would also like to congratulate the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) who took over at short notice, when the honourable member for Stirling was called back suddenly to Australia, and also to commend the delegation secretary, Michael Salkeld, for the outstanding job he did and the excellent support he had from Miss Bertha Williamson. All in all I think it made for a delegation that members of this chamber and this Parliament could be proud of. I believe that our contribution was most worthwhile.
      </para>
      <para>
       I cannot understate the importance of continuing these delegations because I think Australia as a whole can only benefit by having our point of view put in front of the Europeans on a regular basis. Only by continuing to do so will we get any recognition for some of the excellent things that we have done and for some of the work that we are trying to achieve through the GATT negotiations and in other areas, such as were mentioned by honourable members, in trying to do something to tackle the problems in the environment, such as land degradation.

        —by leave-I believe that this particular delegation to the European institutions and the European Parliament could not have come at a more timely moment than this year in which dramatic changes took place in eastern Europe, but also in which there are dramatic changes taking place vis-a-vis the 1992 unity of western Europe. These two simultaneous events are in a kind of dialectical interrelationship which is very important to understand. I believe that the greater concentration of the unity of the western European nations has been a catalyst to many of the events and changes in eastern Europe.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), who did an excellent job as leader of the delegation up to the time he had to return to Australia in about the middle of the trip, made some important comments in relation to the fact that Australians have to become aware-the report emphasised this-of the changes taking place and seek to maximise the opportunities. I do not believe that enough has been done up to this time. I do not think that we really are sufficiently aware of the real impact of the changes taking place, particularly in western Europe. It is not just a question of the economic union of the 12, it is also a question of the social and cultural changes that are taking place. The European Social Charter, which has been signed by 11 out of the 21 and will eventually be signed by Great Britain, brings together the Europeans in more ways than just simply economic terms; I refer to political terms and also social and cultural terms. It will be fascinating to see how they deal with this complex problem of bringing together the various social and cultural forms of what were previously powers that were in great struggle between each other and, let us face it, fashioned much of the history of the rest of the world in previous centuries. In that sense I think it will be very interesting to watch particularly from the point of view of the interest I have in the multicultural policy in Australia. I would like to see how they come to grips with various cultural interactions. One of the things that happened while we were there was that the European Commission passed a law and regulations, putting into place the idea that there would be common production of television programs. It will be interesting to see how they actually do that with all those different cultural agendas coming together.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think the danger for us is that because the Europeans-especially as we go up to 1992-are going to be focusing on each other and on the contributions that they can make, there is a danger indirectly that the rest of the world, especially places such as Australia, might be cut out. It is not just a question of trade barriers. It is a question of what may happen indirectly as a result of the way in which they are forced so intensely to concentrate on each other's needs and requirements economically, socially and politically. When we look at that, plus all the changes that are taking place in eastern Europe, which is the second focus that they have because they are next door and have traditionally been interested in what has been going on in eastern Europe, we see, as the honourable member for Stirling mentioned, excellent opportunities but also dangers of a certain isolation that might occur unless we actively encourage our people to understand what the changes taking place in Europe mean.
      </para>
      <para>
       Furthermore, we need to use the cultural resources that we have in Australia-that is, the various community groups that have come from the European nations-as a kind of link between us and Europe so that we can sustain our interest in what is going to be increasingly a unified Europe. I believe that these missions should continue in the future. They play a wonderful and important role. It is very important, in particular, that we follow the changes that are taking place in eastern and western Europe.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to say something about the second part of the visit in which I had the honour to be the leader of the delegation. I want to thank the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) for his excellent role as deputy leader during that period. We visited two key countries-Cyprus and Portugal. This was the first parliamentary visit to Portugal. There is no doubt that as a result of the visit we have strengthened and cemented relations between Australia and Portugal. That was made clear by the diplomatic cables that came through and the feedback that we received from the visit.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to emphasise one thing that has been mentioned in the report. We were amazed at the extent to which the Portuguese are fascinated by the situation in East Timor. They are obsessed with our position on East Timor. Members of the delegation were subjected to questions about East Timor everywhere they went in Portugal. Throughout that whole period the media especially were very much involved. It is important for us to get some further dialogue going with the Portuguese on our position on East Timor. We have pointed out that although our position is completely different in relation to the recognition of Indonesian incorporation of East Timor, nevertheless we sustain and maintain an enormous interest in human rights in East Timor. I think that we reached some common ground in our discussion of those matters.
      </para>
      <para>
       The visit to Cyprus was particularly significant for me, having been born there. I thank all members of the delegation for their generosity. We changed the program so that we could visit my home village in Cyprus. It was a very emotional and memorable occasion, not only for me but also for other members of the delegation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government of Cyprus is very pleased with the position taken by the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament on the whole Cyprus question. While we were there we met the President of Cyprus and a day later he met the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Singapore. Another very strong statement, supportive of the position of the Cyprus Government and calling on Mr Denktash to come forward and participate once again in discussions before the Secretary-General of the United Nations, was issued by the Prime Minister. Let us hope that these talks will begin and that progress can be made. We firmly believe that progress can be made towards a resolution of the Cyprus problem. Finally, I thank all the people involved in the delegation, and in particular Bertha Williamson and Mike Salkeld, for everything they have done in supporting the delegation. I wish them well in the future.

       The delegation's interest covered a wide spectrum of issues. Obviously, as a former Minister for the environment, the environment was an issue I put high on the agenda. Tourism is also an interest of mine. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the shadow spokesman on tourism for the Liberal Party, had to withdraw at the last minute. He had made tourism a high priority. Nevertheless, all members were interested in that aspect of Canadian affairs, particularly because it is becoming an important areas of business activity in this country. Indian affairs was a special interest of the honourable member for Bass. Parliamentary broadcasting was a matter of great interest to us and we spent a lot of time looking at different forms of parliamentary broadcasting.
      </para>

       The report covers the major issues raised during our discussions and many of the other topics that we explored with Canadian parliamentarians and officials. Overall, our discussions were wide-ranging, reflecting the many similarities between the two countries and the many concerns we have in common. The breadth of the topics we covered is also an indication of how open the Canadians were to the exchange of ideas and information with us. Of importance too for Australians visiting Canada, particularly parliamentarians, are the enormous similarities between the two countries: their Anglo-Celtic background; the fact that they both belong to the British Commonwealth; the fact that they are former colonies of Britain; their similar federal system-Canada has 10 provinces against Australia's six States-and their large land mass. Canada is a huge country, as is Australia, with a small population of 26 million as against our 17 million. Both are migrant countries. We are multicultural societies because we have sought migrants from all over the world. Canada is as much varied in its population mix as we are and has an indigenous population. It has similar problems with its Indian communities as we have with our Aboriginal communities. We both have been dependent for many years on primary industry and trade as the backbone of our economies.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the differences are fascinating. We concentrated on those while we were there. The one thing that dominates Canadian society is the presence of a huge country like the United States across its border and the problems that that brings about for trade and culture-the domination of the Canadian culture by the Americans. The one problem that we do not have and that Canada is facing increasingly is having one large ethnic minority group other than the predominant group which is, as I said, Anglo-Celtic. That of course is the French, or francophone, community which is based primarily in Quebec.
      </para>
      <para>
       Significant changes are being made in the way Canada operates as a nation. For many years the Canadian Government has been trying to update its Constitution to reflect current conditions and priorities. The Constitution was patriated from the United Kingdom in 1982 and amended to incorporate a charter of rights and freedoms. Quebec did not sign the amended Constitution. As the Federal Government describes it, efforts have been made since then to `bring Quebec back into the constitutional family'. To this end, in 1987 an agreement was made by the Prime Minister and the Premiers of all the provinces and is known as the Meech Lake Accord. The term `Meech Lake' dominates all the media and conversation in Canada at the moment. That accord was to seek to make further constitutional amendments. Three of those premiers have since left office and their successors are reneging on, or otherwise qualifying, the support given in 1987. A very heated debate is continuing but unless the proposed constitutional amendments are ratified by all provincial governments by the middle of next year, the accord essentially lapses.
      </para>
      <para>
       Integral to the issue of constitutional reform is the status of Quebec. We were very surprised, and I think concerned from Canada's point of view, at how relaxed people seemed to be about whether Quebec stayed within Canada's federal system. Not so very long ago, at the provincial elections in Quebec, the Parti Quebecois received, I think around 40 per cent of the vote. Of course, it is determined to secede from Canada. It is still a minority group; it is not in government. But a large minority of francophones desire to separate from Canada and become an independent nation. In times past, such secession was always treated as mere idle talk and chatter; no-one took it seriously. But in recent public forums in Canada I understand that, when the question was asked, `Would you like to see Quebec out of the federal system, separate from Canada?', many Anglophone voices said `Yes'. I think many of them there have reached the point where they are fed up with being stood over by the French-Canadians and they are demanding that they be treated totally differently from everybody else. That is a matter for Canada to sort out, but I think it would be a sad day if Canada ever divides.
      </para>
      <para>
       All members of the delegation, in particular our only senator, were very interested in the reform of the Canadian Senate. The Canadians desire what they call a Senate with the three `e's-elected, equal and effective. I do not know whether honourable members are aware of this, but the 102 or more senators are selected by the Canadian Federal Parliament and are appointed by the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, for life. What would happen if someone suggested that our senators should be appointed for life?-Most of them are dead before they get here.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was amused to hear the Canadians suggest that, if they had elected representatives as we do here, they would come in representing the provinces and not political parties. I nearly fell off my chair laughing when I heard that. Of course, we know that it was suggested in the constitutional debates in this country in the last century that our Senate would be a House of Review and it would not represent political parties. Of course, representatives have done this from the moment they took their seats as senators.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to mention the issue of self-determination for the aboriginal peoples of Canada-the Indians and the Inuit. Again, this is wrapped up in the moves to amend the Constitution. The aboriginal peoples of Canada want self-government guaranteed in the Constitution as a sovereign right, while the opposing view is that aboriginal self-government should be provided only through the delegation of powers currently held by the Federal and provincial governments.
      </para>
      <para>
       Undoubtedly the highlight of the visit was the opportunity to meet with the Federal Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Environment. We were quite surprised at the reception we got. We did not expect to appear before such a prestigious committee, nor did we expect that it would place such importance on the visit. But at that meeting, which was open to the public, the delegation and the Committee exchanged information and ideas about a range of environmental issues. It certainly brought home to the delegation how fortunate we in Australia are. Our environmental problems are of our own doing, not imported from across the border, as are so many of Canada's problems. But it also brought home the fact that we have no-one else to blame for not taking more concerted and coordinated action to overcome these problems. The major problems that Canada faces, of course, are problems of water and air pollution, and particularly the problems of acid rain.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, I speak on behalf of all my colleagues in the delegation in reporting that the assistance provided by the Canadians was faultless and contributed to the success of the visit, as did the efforts of the staff in Australia who made administrative arrangements and provided briefing materials. I do not know whether this will be my last speech in Parliament House; it depends on whether we come back next year. I hope that it is not my last speech but, if it is, it was a great honour to have led this delegation. I could not have wished for a more harmonious or better group of people to travel with.

        —by leave-I am sure that other members of the delegation who are in the House today will agree with the comments made by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen). Referring to his last comment, this may also be my last speech in the House. From my point of view and certainly that of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), the other Liberal member on the delegation, we got on extremely well. The Australian High Commission in Canada reported:

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The visit of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Canada is regarded by this post to have been an unqualified success which demonstrated, amongst many things, the warmth of the relationship generally between Canada and Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst that may be a typically diplomatic report from our High Commission in Canada, nevertheless I hope and trust that our visit to Canada enhanced the links between our two countries. Certainly from the Australian perspective, as I have already indicated, I endorse the comments of the leader of the delegation that not only did members of the delegation and their spouses get on extremely well, but also it is true to say that we got on well with our hosts and those Canadians we met both officially and unofficially.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst there are significant differences between our two countries there are also enormous similarities. Internationally, we share a number of common goals. The report details, as has already been outlined by the leader of the delegation, a number of major current issues in Canada and those matters are discussed in some detail in the report. They include: constitutional reform, protection of the environment, tourism and communications, including the televising of Parliament, and parliamentary information systems. We had the opportunity of meeting with Ministers, members and senators in formal discussions on a number of occasions and, during those discussions, other issues such as the economy, trade and relations with the United States, were raised.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the purposes of visits such as these is to explore the opportunities for pursuing common goals on the international stage. On this front I was particularly pleased with the understanding within the upper levels of the Canadian public service of the need to pursue aggressively every avenue possible to achieve the liberalisation of world trade. Whilst Australia and Canada appear to be treading the same path on this all-important issue there are some within the Canadian Parliament who are wary-just as I suppose there are some who are wary within this Parliament-of the move to freer trade and less regulation, both internationally and domestically.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst in Ottawa I met with the Canadian agricultural officials from the policy planning division and from the Agricultural Stabilisation Board. I pursued Australia's concern about Canada's entry into the United States-Canada free trade agreement and our view that we should not be prejudiced by that agreement, that our export to Canada of some $30m worth of canned fruit a year ought to be allowed to continue and we should not be subjected to tariffs which would force us out of that market. The officials certainly understood our position and believed that, following a meeting between our respective Prime Ministers, the matter would be satisfactorily resolved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another issue I raised which is, I am sure, of interest to the House is the restructuring which is occurring in Canada's agricultural sector. Just as we in Australia are undergoing restructuring in both the agricultural sector and manufacturing sector so the Government in Canada is reviewing controls on the Canadian agricultural industry. The extent of government intervention is quite significant in Canada, with quotas being applied, for example, to eggs, dairy products, chicken and turkey production together with significant government grain freight subsidies. Canadian officials briefed me on the release of a policy paper called, `Growing Together-A Vision for Canada's Agri-food Industry'. That paper, which happened to be released on the day of my visit, is clearly aimed at stimulating debate in an endeavour to move Canada from a more regulated rural sector to a more market-oriented, self-reliant sector. There is a growing appreciation within Canada's rural sector, just as there is in Australia, of the need for Canada to accept the rapidly changing world circumstances and to respond to the changes which are occurring on world markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to international agricultural trade, there is a great deal of support for the line being taken by Australian in the international trade forums, such as through the Cairns Group in the lead up to the Uruguay Round. I certainly used our meeting to reinforce Australia's view of the need to work together with other members of the Cairns Group to press for greater liberalisation of agricultural trade.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, it is interesting to note that the majority of Canada's 25 million people live within a couple of hundred kilometres of the border with the United States of America and 75 per cent of Canada's trade is with the United States. The influence of the United States on Canada is great in almost every aspect of life, including communications. But there are significant differences between the two countries. For example, while there is obviously a crime and drug problem in Canada, similar to that of Australia, it does not seem to be anywhere near as bad as in the United States. The question which I posed, and which a number of others raised, was why such a difference exists. Some suggest that it might be just that there are higher concentrations of population in the United States. That might be the case but I am of the view that it is more likely that the different forms of government in the two countries is the most significant factor.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the establishment of its system of government Canada, like Australia, relied more heavily on the Westminster system of government than did the United States. Our judiciary, our law enforcement and our views regarding individual rights and obligations are similar to those of Canada, whereas the United States tends to place greater weight on the election of its judiciary and a number of its law enforcement officers and places greater emphasis on individual rights and less emphasis on obligations. I am not sure whether or not the different systems of government in the United States and Canada is one of the reasons for a much greater crime and drug problem in the United States than in Canada but it was interesting for us to review the differences between the two countries. I certainly came away from Canada reinforced in the view that the system of government that we share with the Canadians, that is based fairly strongly on the Westminster system, is one of the best in the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our Canadian hosts spared no effort in ensuring that we were extremely well looked after and that our special interests were catered for in the development of the program. I particularly thank Mr Francois Pregent, Mrs Felicity Liebe and Mr Wayne Cameron, who travelled with us. They worked extremely hard to ensure that our visit was a success and they were great hosts and great company. I would also like to thank Lindy Smith, the Secretary of the delegation, for the excellent job she has done in assisting the delegation both in Canada and in preparing the report on our return.
      </para>
      <para>
       The members of the delegation thoroughly enjoyed themselves in Canada and I believe that we learnt a great deal about the Canadian nation and its people. That knowledge can only enhance the close, friendly and supportive relationship which exists between our two countries.

        —by leave-I just want to make a few brief remarks, firstly, to associate myself with the warm remarks that were made by the leader and deputy leader of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Canada, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) respectively, in our thanks to our Secretary, Lindy Smith, and our Canadian hosts. This was a very successful delegation, and the cables from the Australian High Commission in Ottawa testify to that. There were a lot of meetings, many of them extremely productive. As spokesman in this place for Aboriginal affairs and as the person responsible here for environmental legislation, I found the trip exceptionally rewarding. I found that many issues with regard to Canadian aboriginal matters had a lot of common ground with similar issues in this country. I note that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) is sitting at the table and I am sure he has looked at the Canadian situation. The broadening of the economic base, which is a thrust of Canadian policy, is likewise a bipartisan thrust of policy in this place. Certainly I was enriched by the experience and challenged by the ideas and problems that the Canadians share with us as they try to develop policies to benefit their communities.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       One of the highlights of the delegation's visit was a formal hearing before the Standing Committee of Environment in the Parliament in Ottawa to which the leader of the delegation ably responded. As far as I am aware, that was the first time a visiting delegation from another country was able to go in a formal session before a standing committee of a parliament not so much to give evidence but to share ideas. That was particularly positive and I think it recognises that environmental matters are transboundary and transnational; they are world concerns. We participated in a very significant undertaking there and it is perhaps a model that we might consider when appropriate delegations are visiting Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wanted to make one other point, about the issue of trade. The honourable member for Barker spoke about trade in relation to Canada and I do not want to canvass further the points that he made, but as the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) is in the chamber I want to mention the new trade agreement between Canada and the United States. That is the biggest bilateral trading relationship in the world; 75 per cent of Canada's trade is with the United States. The new free trade agreement, which was the subject of major debate in the last Canadian Federal election, provides Canada with an extra marketing tool in the fast-growing Pacific Rim. It can go to those Pacific markets and say, `Look, if you come and establish joint ventures with us-manufacturing plants and others-you not only have access to the Canadian market but you have free access to the United States market'. I think that is a particularly attractive marketing tool that the Canadians now have. For us in Australia it means that in a very competitive world we have to be even more aggressive, pragmatic and determined in our trade policies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Last night, we saw the breakthrough legislation that passed through this chamber in relation to Taiwan. We need to have more such legislation and more such pragmatism driving trade policy because from Australia's point of view it is either trade or perish. The Canadians are showing how aggressive we need to be to retain and maintain our markets. Canada is a competitor with us in the resources area. We need to recognise that fact and study its procedures and policies to try to improve our own. This trip was exceptionally good in exposing those issues to us. All of us learnt a great deal from them and this report in part, relates to that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have pleasure in endorsing the report and, more particularly, in thanking the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Robertson and the deputy leader, the honourable member for Barker, for an exceptionally well led delegation. There was a very good rapport amongst all of us, which all honourable members know is so important to the success of visits by delegations. This was an exceptionally good trip, and half way through the visit by the delegation I even started reading the recent book by the honourable member for Robertson, which was a concession to socialism that I thought I would never make.

        —On 8 November 1988, I provided an answer to a question on notice from the then honourable member for Gwydir, Mr Hunt. The relevant question and answer can be found at pages 2619 and 2620 of the Hansard of 8 November 1988, and concern the purchase of the Oasis Hotel by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). In my response to part (12) of the honourable member's question, I stated that:

       The Board of Commissioners in August decided to suspend repayments owing by Gamilarai Ltd on ADC loans until the Oasis Hotel is leased out.

       The Board approved transfer of title to the hotel to Barwon Aboriginal Community Ltd on condition that the hotel must be leased out for commercial operation for a period of 5 years with a further option of another 5 years. A mortgage will be executed to this end. Barwon will be required to apply all income derived to paying out the debts of Gamilarai Ltd.
      </para>
      <para>
       This statement was based on information provided to me on 3 November 1988 by the Acting General Manager of the ADC. This information reflected a resolution of the ADC Board at its sixty-first meeting held in August 1988. However, at the later meetings held in October 1988, the ADC Board rescinded its earlier resolution and resolved that the hotel must be leased on a commercial basis for a minimum period of five years, and that utilisation of income from the lease of the hotel would be at the discretion of Barwon Aboriginal Community Ltd. This later resolution was not taken into account in the ADC's advice to me of 3 November.

       This matter was not drawn to my attention until November this year. I table a copy of a letter from the Acting General Manager of the ADC in which the details are outlined.

        That the Bill be now read a second time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill was first introduced into the Senate in April 1988. Owing to the pressure of Government business, the Bill unfortunately languished on the Notice Paper until April this year and did not reach the committee stage until October. However, the Senate has been able to conduct a full and frank debate on the important provisions contained in this Bill. I hope that the Bill can now have a speedy passage through this House.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill is designed to give legislative effect to the remaining acceptable recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform made in its first and second reports to the last Parliament. The first report made a number of recommendations concerning the representation of Territories in the Federal Parliament and the second report made a series of recommendations designed to fine tune the electoral and referendum Acts as a result of the Committee's review of the operation of the electoral legislation at the 1984 general election. Honourable members will also recall that the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act 1987 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Act 1988 were designed to give effect to some of the more important recommendations of the second report.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill provides fixed formulae for the representation of Territories in the Federal Parliament. The Joint Standing Committee examined this issue, following concern that it would be possible for a government with a majority in both Houses to increase the representation of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory out of proportion to their populations. The Government has accepted the Committee's conclusion that fixed formulae for the representation of Territories should be prescribed. Accordingly, this Bill provides for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to be entitled to be represented by at least one member of the House of Representatives, and that representation thereafter be in proportion to its population. Other Commonwealth Territories will be entitled to separate representation when their population exceeds more than one half of a quota as determined by section 48 of the Electoral Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides that where the numbers of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory is six or more, that Territory will be entitled to representation in the Senate on the basis of one senator for every two members of the House of Representatives. However, each will be entitled to a minimum of two senators. Other Commonwealth Territories will be entitled to representation in the Senate on the basis of one senator for every two members of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now outline some of the major provisions of the Bill that result from the Committee's second report. The Bill provides for the printing and distribution of the electoral roll to senators, members and political parties no later than the end of the second year of each Parliament. Senators' present entitlement of one set of electoral rolls for their State will increase to five, and members' present entitlement of one electoral roll for their division will also increase to five, thus making it easier for senators and members to carry out their electorate responsibilities. Provision is also made for the electoral roll to be available to senators, members and political parties in certain cases in the form of magnetic tapes or discs. The Bill limits the uses to which enrolment information supplied on magnetic tape or disc can be put and attaches penalties to the disclosure or commercial use of the information.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been some confusion about the term `postal vote' as in some cases electors are able to apply in person. This Bill repeals the present provisions in the electoral and referendum Acts relating to postal voting and substitutes new provisions relating to postal and pre-poll voting. The new provisions draw a clear distinction between postal and pre-poll votes, so that votes applied for in writing and sent through the post or otherwise delivered continue to be referred to as postal votes, while votes applied in person and returned to a polling official will be referred to as pre-poll votes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also enables the provision of mobile voting facilities in hospitals and special hospitals to be more extensive and confirms the right of patients to a postal vote. The electoral and referendum Acts presently give hospitals and nursing homes the right to veto mobile polling by not entering into arrangements for the taking of the patients' votes. Provision is also made for mobile polling teams visiting hospitals to carry and distribute how to vote material in the same way that mobile teams in remote areas already do.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill makes a number of changes to party registration including insertion of a requirement that a party wishing to make application for registration has a written constitution, provides for public inspection of objections to applications to register political parties, requires the Australian Electoral Commission to provide copies of objections to applications to registration to the prospective registered officer, and clarifies the circumstances which may lead to deregistration of a registered political party.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also makes a number of amendments to the election funding and financial disclosure provisions, including: changing the definition of the disclosure period in relation to gifts received to include the period of 30 days after polling day and requiring that campaign committees of candidates and/or Senate groups endorsed by registered political parties be treated as part of the party organisation. Other amendments require that agents of candidates and Senate groups be appointed before the close of nominations; the Commission to keep a register of party agents; enable the Commission to extend the period for the submission of claims for public funding; enable the Commission to redetermine claims for public funding; change the disclosure requirement in relation to gifts from the number of gifts received to the number of donors; decrease the need for receipt of returns of broadcasters and publishers from 15 weeks to 8 weeks after polling day and require the broadcasters and publishers to identify the person requesting the advertisement; require broadcasters to keep a copy of advertisements for one month after furnishing a return to the Commission and enable the Electoral Commissioner to bring court action to recover debts due to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill reintroduces a fine for failure by an elector to advise of his or her change of address within a subdivision. Following acceptance of one of the recommendations in the first report of the Joint Standing Committee, it was no longer an offence for an elector to fail to notify a change in his or her place of living, provided that the new address was within the same subdivision. However, with the decision to reduce the number of subdivisions, wherever practicable, such failure to notify changes of address can lead to the rolls becoming inaccurate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Joint Standing Committee concluded that the Electoral Act should be amended to dispense with the requirement for district returning officers to exercise casting votes to determine the result of a deadlocked election. The Committee considered that an immediate recount and a fresh preliminary scrutiny of rejected declaration votes should be a statutory requirement. The Committee also concluded that, if at the end of the recount the result is still deadlocked, the district returning officer should advise the Electoral Commission, and the Electoral Commission should file a petition disputing the election. Accordingly, the Bill so provides.
       </para>
       <para>
        Concern was also expressed about the possibility of petitions alleging a range of standard irregularities in general terms and relying on the court procedures to provide the evidence necessary to substantiate them. This Bill requires petitions to the Court of Disputed Returns to be more specific in their allegations disputing the result of an election or referendum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions in the Bill relating to the fixed formulae for the representation of Territories and related redistribution provisions will come into effect on royal assent. The remaining provisions of the Bill, mainly relating to operational matters, will come into effect on a day or days to be proclaimed. Any provisions not proclaimed on 30 September 1990 will automatically commence on that day. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

         —At the outset I wish to highlight for members of this House and the public that the Bill we are now debating, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988, has been introduced into the House of Representatives for the first time by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), who is responsible for the Electoral Act, on the last day of a special two-day sitting designed to clean up the legislative mess created by the Government during the past year. Although it has been on the Senate Notice Paper for some time, it has not been available to members of the House of Representatives in the form that it has been presented today until a few minutes ago. When I inquired at 10.30 this morning as to when this debate was likely to commence-it was originally scheduled to commence at approximately 10 a.m.-I was informed that the Bill had still not been received from the Government Printer. This is the Australian Parliament, not a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. It is a disgraceful reminder of how this Government pushes legislation through the Australian Parliament like a butcher forces mince through a sausage machine.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Honourable members are aware how debate on important legislation is repeatedly curtailed. Over the past two years more often than not the Government has used the guillotine to push legislation through the Parliament at the end of sitting periods. In one instance last year the Government, with the use of the guillotine, pushed 28 Bills through the House of Representatives in three days. This year it has used the guillotine to force more than 40 Bills through the House of Representatives with little and sometimes no debate. To give credit where it is due, the Minister for Administrative Services, who is seated at the table, did everything he could yesterday after the Bill passed through the Senate to ensure that I was briefed, as best I could be in the available time, ahead of this debate. I am sure that the Minister is embarrassed at being forced by his Government to steamroll this Bill through the House in the way that he seems obliged to do. I thank him for doing what he could to assist me to prepare for this debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the guillotine is not being applied in this case it must be remembered that today is Friday and Christmas Day is on Monday. Santa Claus does much better than this Government. He prepares his toys for distribution during the year to avoid rush and error as Christmas approaches. This Bill has been dragging its way through the Senate in a fitful, on again off again way for more than a year now until it has finally reached this House in the dying hours of the last sitting days for 1989; possibly the last sitting day of this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government were so intent on getting this Bill through one would have thought that the Government would have pursued it more vigorously in the Senate and then given this House a more reasonable time frame in which to consider it. Even though a lot of groundwork has been done in the Senate, despite the Government's disjointed approach to it-and the Opposition has won significant concessions there-what has come to us is still a complex piece of legislation which consists of no less than 123 pages.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill amends many of the significant sections of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. It is designed to give legislative effect to the remaining acceptable recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform made in its first and second reports to the last Parliament. Since then the Committee has made another report arising from the 1987 Federal election. It made a series of highly questionable recommendations affecting free speech and funding which the Opposition totally rejected. However, the Government has put that report and its controversial recommendations aside hoping that there will be a more opportune time in the future to achieve these objectives. This is just another example of the Labor Government's cynical exercises in gradualism.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have pointed out, the Government's decision not to take any action on that report at this stage is a clear victory for the Opposition in its campaign against the report's recommendations. It also confirms recent indications that the Government is not prepared to face a strong attack from the Opposition in the lead-up to the next election. Thus, the Government is pressing on with this current legislation, which we are being forced to deal with in a strictly limited time frame during this brief recall sitting. There has been no sense of urgency about it until now; so why not leave it until after the election when due consideration could be given to it, rather than ram it through now in the dying hours of this sitting? It is just another example of the Government's lack of attack over the organisation of its legislative program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is forever pointing to what is described as the Senator Macklin amendment, as he did yesterday, and saying that if the Opposition had not supported it, the House of Representatives would have had two or three weeks extra sitting time available to deal with relevant legislation. As a result of the Macklin amendment, the Senate will not deal with legislation presented to it after a prescribed date. This decision was taken by the Senate some time ago as a result of this Labor Government repeatedly presenting volumes of legislation for it to deal with in the last days of a sitting, with the result that proper parliamentary scrutiny was impossible. While that cut-off is in place, surely it devolves upon the Government to organise its legislative program and the sittings of this House accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill before us addresses the following matters: to provide a fixed formula for the representation of Territories and new States in the Federal Parliament; to provide for the printing and distribution of the electoral rolls to senators, members and political parties no later than the end of the second year of each parliament; to provide for the availability to specific persons or groups of the electoral roll in the form of microfiche and magnetic tapes and discs; to make provision for a clear distinction between votes issues pursuant to written application, to be called postal votes, and votes issued pursuant to oral application, to be called pre-poll votes; to tighten the provisions relating to the registration and deregistration of political parties; to enable the use of mobile polling in hospitals to be more extensive and allow mobile polling teams visiting hospitals to carry and distribute how-to-vote material; to provide that religious objection to voting shall be a valid and sufficient reason for not voting; to make a number of changes related to the system of reporting and noting the financial arrangements made in support of political parties under the disclosure provisions of the Act; to provide a new method for resolving deadlocks in elections and to make certain changes related to the way in which the Court of Disputed Returns operates. Some of these matters are of concern to us in the Opposition and will be dealt with during the committee stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to make some general comments regarding the existing legislation which purports to implement a system of one vote one value. The Government argues that such a system will ensure fair elections. It implies that it will provide majority rule and overcome gerrymanders. This is an illusion. Neither the principle of one vote one value nor the legislation can achieve such a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the very best, and under the most accurate and fair electoral laws, one vote one value can simply prevent malapportionment; that is, it can ensure that, as far as possible, at a given point in time all electorates contain an equal number of voters. It can prevent the construction of numerically small and numerically large electorates in the one State. It can, for example, prevent such factors as distance and special topography influencing the number of voters. It can insist that equality of numbers throughout the State shall be the overriding factor.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even if the formula and the decisions by the Electoral Commission were accurate-an impossible assumption in itself-there are inherent defects. It can never provide one vote one value on polling day-the only time when the elimination of malapportionment is relevant. The present law provides for a redistribution every seven years and seeks to achieve an equality of numbers in all electorates in a State at the median, or 3 1/2 years point, with a theoretical maximum allowable tolerance of 2 per cent. The last Federal election was in July 1987. The median point of the 1984 distribution was December 1987. The difference in enrolments between those two dates was very marked in most electorates.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will not be another redistribution until after the next election. These serious distortions which were revealed at the median point will be further greatly aggravated by polling day. Certainly, there will be no one vote one value on that day-the only day the principle matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        There can never be one vote one value throughout Australia under the existing Commonwealth Constitution, which provides the formula under which, based on State populations-not enrolments-each State determines the number of electorates. That number, divided into the total State enrolments, provides the electoral quota for the State. There can be considerable differences in such quotas between States. Yet the governing party in Canberra is determined by the party or coalition which achieves a majority of seats throughout Australia, those seats having varying enrolments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, under the Constitution, Tasmania must have a minimum of five Federal electorates, whatever its total enrolments may be. Over the years, Tasmanian electorate enrolments have been considerably smaller than those of other States. The Australian Capital Territory has two electorates because there is deemed to be more than one quota. The Northern Territory, on the other hand, has one electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        One vote one value, even if accurate, cannot guarantee majority rule. It could not do so in 1987 when the coalition increased its vote, gained an overall majority of votes throughout Australia, but actually lost seats and secured only a minority of seats. One vote one value still allows major gerrymanders. Mapmakers may still ensure an equality of votes in all seats while so drawing electoral boundaries as to produce a gerrymander and frustrate majority rule.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the existing Commonwealth Constitution the provision that each State, irrespective of enrolments, shall have an equal number of senators is, of course, quite contrary to one vote one value. The Constitution deliberately favours the four less populous States by giving them a greatly disproportionate voice in the Senate. The Australian electors are unlikely ever to change that principle since it is seen as an offset to the majority of seats in the lower House held by New South Wales and Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present legislation and its methods of implementation are far from accurate in ensuring one vote one value. Redistributions are based on two main statistical lists issued by the Electoral Commission, the accuracy of which is currently not capable of scrutiny or challenge. Those lists are, firstly, the stated enrolments at the commencement of the redistribution; and, secondly, the forecast enrolments at the median point 3 1/2 years later.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most important concerns is the Commonwealth electoral roll and its integrity. That must be preserved at all costs. The electoral rolls, however, have been notoriously inaccurate. The Electoral Commission has frequently indicated that there was an inefficiency of funds to do full habitation checks at regular intervals. The very unevenness of these checks can, in itself, distort a whole State. For example, an error of 200 enrolments in any one electorate-a more common occurrence-inevitably causes a ripple effect throughout every electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, in recent years the printed electoral rolls have not been freely available for individual or party workers to use or to scrutinise for accuracy. The practice of producing printouts a few weeks before the elections is a bad one, frustrating access to the ordinary electoral process. On the last occasion in my electorate of Hume I received a roll one day or two days before polling day. This was totally unsatisfactory in every respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier this year in the New South Wales Parliament a report was tabled by a New South Wales Government committee of inquiry which examined all aspects of the conduct of elections in that State. Apart from noting that the State Electoral Office had been `badly served so far as access to roll information is concerned', it drew attention to multiple voting. The committee pointed out that it occurred with greater regularity than fraudulent voting and added that it had `the potential to result in much more serious consequences'. The committee went on to state:
       </para>
       <para>
        The opportunities for multiple voting have been greatly enhanced by the enactment of legislation which now enables people to vote at any polling place in the electorate in which they are enrolled.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, the integrity of the electoral system has suffered through people being able to vote at any polling place in the electorate instead of being confined, as previously, to the subdivisions in which they live.
       </para>
       <para>
        The committee found that, at the last New South Wales State election, multiple voting appeared to have occurred in nearly all the State's 109 electorates, especially in the State division of Balmain where one voter was suspected of having voted at least 15 times. Irregularities have also occurred in Western Australia. Following the Western Australian State election it was found that in many electorates, electors had addresses which are now parks or condemned properties. Some families registered at the same address more than once and some votes were also cast in the same name more than once.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is all very disturbing bearing in mind that in some electorates the outcome of an election is determined by a handful of votes, in some cases less than 200. To improve the accuracy of the rolls, continuous and thorough habitation reviews should be carried out with full knowledge and cooperation by the States sharing joint rolls. The Electoral Commission has reported that in the interval between the announcement of the 1987 election and the closing of the rolls-a matter of only days-there were in excess of 700,000 changes lodged to electoral rolls: almost three-quarters of a million changes. The magnitude of this figure must excite inquiry. At its very best, its most innocent, it indicates the gross inaccuracies of the rolls prior to the announcement. On its least innocent interpretation it raises the question of false enrolments.
       </para>
       <para>
        This whole question was highlighted by the report that in December 1987, six months after the rolls closed for the election, there was a decline of 48,000 in the total enrolments in New South Wales and some 60,000 or more in Victoria. Yet, with normal trends of population growth, the enrolments should have increased. Again, at its most innocent, it points to gross defects in the rolls. An analysis of sudden movements in growth and decline of enrolments in key swing electorates around an election period may indicate a much more serious explanation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The political parties and the communities, in submitting proposals for redistribution, are forced to accept the validity of the enrolments. It is useless making a submission which argues that particular enrolments are defective. The Commission can scarcely accept the validity of such a claim without calling off the redistribution and publishing an amended list. Otherwise, all other submissions would be based on false statistics. It takes only one error of a few thousand to create a total ripple effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Current redistribution practices are not required to produce majority rule, the principle on which democracy is based. In the past electoral commissioners have asserted that they are not required to take into account the political consequences of their mapmaking. They argue that they are not required to ensure that the party which polls the majority of votes gets the majority of seats. Here, then, is the strongest of anomalies: great lip-service is paid to the principle of one vote one value in each electorate, but not to the whole of Australia. In the 1987 election, a clear majority of coalition votes Australia-wide was not equal to a minority of Labor votes. Having regard to these deficiencies, rolls should be available no later than 18 months after the commencement of a new parliament as well as three months before a redistribution and before the ensuing election. A vital further provision is that there should be a complete habitation check of every electorate so that the rolls are as accurate as possible. The rolls should also be available in street order and no charge should be made for the lodgment of challenges to the accuracy of rolls if, in the opinion of the Electoral Commission, the challenge is made in good faith.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having touched on redistribution, I add here that I will be moving on behalf of the Opposition an amendment dealing with the processes of redistribution. We will be focusing on the fact that in this country a situation can arise where a party can win a majority of the votes, and indeed a majority on a two-party preferred basis, and nonetheless actually lose seats. At the last general election the Liberal and National parties combined secured 46.07 per cent of the vote on a national basis, whereas the Labor Party polled only 45.83 per cent nationally. Yet the coalition lost seats and the Labor Party gained seats. Accordingly, we will move an amendment requiring that steps be taken in terms of Commonwealth legislation to ensure that a party winning in excess of 50 per cent of the votes is entitled to more than 50 per cent of the seats.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before being amended in the Senate, the Bill was to have provided for all prisoners, excluding those convicted of treason, to be given the right to vote and for mobile polling booths in prisons. The Government was forced to give way. That extension is now not to be provided, though it still provides for a prisoner who is entitled to vote to be enrolled for the subdivision for which the prisoner was enrolled when he or she began serving the sentence.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has also not pressed its amendment relating to questions to voters. The prescribed questions will stand, rather than the questions as to name, address and whether the person has voted before in the election being left to the discretion of the presiding officer. Although the Government has not pressed these matters, I suggest that it has just put them on the back burner and that they remain the Government's real policies and intention. In the unlikely event-I emphasise `in the unlikely event'-that the Labor Party remains in government these issues will be on the agenda again.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to hospitals. Under the existing Act a candidate is precluded from entering hospitals, special hospitals, nursing homes or similar institutions to canvass for votes once the writs for an election have been issued. We will move to delete that provision. The Opposition believes that the restriction should be more reasonable and should bar such visits only on polling day or, say, the week leading up to polling day. In a fair and open democratic election, why should a candidate be denied the right to canvass inside hospitals, special hospitals or nursing homes? The people in those institutions are among those most likely not to have access to electoral information other than that provided by the Electoral Commission. Accordingly, we will seek the removal of the clause which restricts visits to hospitals by candidates. Apart from that we also question why the Electoral Commission needs to issue badges to scrutineers, which is provided for in an amendment to section 264 of the Act. We consider this an absolutely unnecessary additional piece of regulatory nonsense on the part of the Electoral Commission. We have done perfectly well without such badges in the past. However, on this occasion we will not press this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that when this Bill was being debated in the Senate the Government accepted the Australian Democrats' amendment prohibiting the placing of other words on the ballot paper for referendum questions, other than `yes' or `no' in the prescribed place. I am glad to note also that the Government has acknowledged in the Senate a drafting error which, contrary to the Constitution, would have removed the power of State Governors to issue writs for the election of senators for the States. Whilst we have reservations about various aspects of the Bill, the Opposition will not vote against the Bill as a whole. However, as I have pointed out, I will move two major amendments in the committee stage and the Opposition will call for a division on these during the committee stage of the Bill.

I have lived through the rule of the National Party and the Liberal Party in Queensland, parties which have manipulated and contrived to maintain power through the electoral system. The sorts of justifications which the shadow Minister for administrative services, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), has just argued are the same sorts of justifications which the Queensland National Party-that proven corrupt Party-argued in Queensland. There was the attack on the concept of one vote one value which is enshrined in the Commonwealth electoral laws and which is rejected out of hand by the National Party, not only in Queensland but federally. It opposes the concept of one vote one value. As occurs in Queensland, the Liberal Party is forced to tag along with the National Party in that respect.

       <para>
        We have also had an attack on the idea of the integrity of the electoral roll. It is a pity that the shadow Minister did not express his fine words to the former Queensland Government when it was attempting to deny Queenslanders the vote in the last State election by checking the State electoral rolls with the Queensland electricity authority accounts. The fact that only about half of the 1.8 million people entitled to vote in Queensland could have possibly had electricity accounts did not seem to matter at all. In fact if it could have struck half the people off the roll it would have served its purpose.

         —It was a desperation tactic. Fortunately it did not work; it came nowhere near working. That is the same sort of argument, the same sort of furphy, put forward by the conservatives here. They argue that during the last Federal election somehow they were robbed. The shadow spokesman knows that what he us saying is not true. He makes the bland statement, `If you add the Liberal and National Party vote together it comes to 46.07 per cent'. The reality is that we have-and he may not have noticed it-what is called a preferential system of voting. Oddly enough, not all conservative voters given their preferences to the other conservative party. For instance, I was elected on Liberal Party preferences because of the leakage of those preferences that did not go directly to the National Party. That is hardly surprising in Queensland. At least there are a number of decent people in Queensland who support the Liberal Party and who will not have a bar of the National Party there.

         —Most of them did come over, as did a lot of people who previously supported the National Party and realised the error of their ways. The simple point is that it is an absolute furphy simply to add together the Liberal and National Party vote and say that it is rock solid and it is one body of vote. It is not. Second preferences leak to other parties, including the Australian Labor Party.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The shadow Minister also conveniently forgot to mention the role of minor parties, particularly the Australian Democrats, and the fact that we have a preferential system. On a two-party preferred basis, clearly the Labor Party did achieve a majority of votes at the last Federal election. Certainly in the 1987 result, overall the Labor Party vote declined, but it won more seats. Again that is the effect of where the votes were won, where they were cast. The same thing happened in the Queensland election. For many years the Labor Party was disadvantaged-and still is disadvantaged under the existing system there-in that the vast body of its votes are locked up in particular areas. Seats with fewer electors returned conservative members. In the last Queensland election in a number of such smaller seats there was such significant change, such massive swings, that preferences went to Labor. Labor is a net beneficiary of the gerrymander as it now stands. Despite that, it will not continue with that system and will refer the processes of the electoral system to an independent body. The same sort of processes which operate federally, one suspects, will operate in Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other point which the shadow spokesman made which concerned me was his attack on the processes of redistribution. One of the great strengths in the current system is the fact that it is separated from the Government. There is no right of veto maintained by the Government in order to override what the Electoral Commission comes up with in terms of its redistribution. That was a very significant and fundamental change which was introduced by this Government before the 1984 election. It is significant that in Queensland, the Electoral Commissioner could draw up the boundaries however he saw fit. The executive Government could then change them as it saw fit. To be able to divorce that process of redistribution so it is taken out of the hands of politicians and put into the hands of an independent umpire surely is a vastly superior system. The shadow spokesman certainly did not promote a system whereby the right of veto should be returned to government. But it worried me when he started attacking the process of redistribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also had the argument, which is really an old hat argument, that somehow the rolls are a bit shonky. A lot of this came out after the last Federal election. It came before the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters. We instructed the Electoral Commission to do a complete check of this. One item which was mentioned was multiple voting. A report was given to us on the incidence of multiple voting throughout the Australian divisions in the last election. There was simply no evidence whatsoever of any widespread fraud in relation to multiple voting. My own seat of Fisher is a seat which was fairly keenly contested. In fact, it is the most marginal seat in Australia and, as honourable members can imagine, there was a fair bit of scrutiny of it. As a result of that scrutiny suggestions were raised that there had been multiple voting. So the Electoral Commission did a complete check of the situation in my own seat. It found that there were 200 apparent examples of multiple voting, that is, a person whose name had been crossed off certified lists twice at various polling booths. The examination, from memory, found that in about 180 cases there was an error by the poll clerk, who simply ruled a line through the wrong name as someone with the same surname came to vote. For instance, John Smith was ruled off instead of David Smith.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of the remaining cases, which were individually followed up, there was only one case of actual multiple voting where a person apparently voted for his brother. His brother was overseas and did not vote so he decided he would square up by voting twice. That was one vote in an electorate which, at that stage, had an enrolment of around 73,000 people. That is the evidence that was to be put forward today to show that something is wrong with the electoral rolls, that they are a bit shonky and that the last Federal election was the result of people voting many times in key seats. The simple fact is that the Opposition lost the last election, and still seems to find it a little hard to accept. It lost that election under a fair system and will lose the next one under a fair system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I move on from responding to the shadow spokesman to the Bill itself. I accept his comments that this is an important Bill. It is not the most desirable thing to be discussing it during the last moments of the last days of this session, but one cannot get away from the fact that the Bill has been stuck in the Senate where the Opposition and the Australian Democrats control the numbers. When the Opposition in this chamber complains bitterly about the flow of legislation, it should look at its own actions in the Senate, because that is where the bottleneck is occurring. That is where this piece of legislation has been stuck for a long time. There have been various debates on it. The most recent one was on an amendment from the Democrats to try to ban how to vote cards. That was canvassed in the Senate, as were the provisions of the Bill and the amendments made to it. The shadow spokesman alluded to that.
       </para>
       <para>
        If ever a piece of legislation has been well debated by this Parliament it is probably this one, because it has been before the Senate for well over a year. In fact, it is the last piece of legislation that started life in the provisional Parliament House which is finally being passed by this House, so I suppose history is being made at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of the provisions in the Bill are a result of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform-now the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters-following the 1984 general election. That was a watershed election in many ways. For instance, there was a large increase in the number of members of this place to 148. I believe it was the first election in which there was disclosure of public funding, as well as a range of other changes concerning the actual operation of the election. The Committee's report on the outcome of that election was important, and a number of the changes which we are debating today finetune that system. The Committee's report concluded that the system as it was operating, and as it now operates, was essentially a good one, and a vast improvement on the system which operated under the conservative governments which had dominated since the Second World War.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will touch briefly on a number of the recommendations. The first concerns the election of members and senators from Territories. That matter is being classified by this Bill and I do not believe there is much debate on it. I digress for a second-because I did not have a chance yesterday to speak to the Joint Standing Committee's report on the electoral system in Canberra-to extend my congratulations to the Chairman of the Subcommittee on the work that it did. The Committee's proposal-that is, to put the question to the people of Canberra-is reasonable, and should finally put to rest the question of what is an appropriate system for self-government in the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another important provision-certainly to practising politicians-is that concerning electoral rolls. Electoral rolls are probably the most basic tools of trade which a member of parliament has. In many ways they are the means by which we know who our constituents are and how we communicate with them. This Bill allows members to obtain rolls in magnetic tape form so they can be used on computers in members' offices, and that is significant. The facility is available now through the State organisations, but the Bill clarifies the position. It also adds safeguards in terms of the commercial use of this information. That is a reasonable balance which allows members and senators to communicate with their electors and carry out their jobs properly, and also protects people's legitimate privacy concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further important change concerns some tightening up of public funding and financial disclosure. The Bill does not touch on the latest report of the Joint Committee entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune. The Opposition spokesman referred to that report which, inasmuch as it recommended an extension of the free time concept to the electronic media, has attracted widespread criticism. But the other equally important half of that report detailed the apparent abuses which can occur in terms of financial disclosure. That is an important subject, and the Committee's recommendations on it are equally important.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last Federal election and recent State elections saw the growth of third parties which, in some instances, are obviously front organisations for political parties, designed to avoid the existing financial disclosure rules. Although they are not touched upon in this Bill, the Parliament will have to bite the bullet sooner or later about how it is to deal with them. I hope that at some time in the future, even if the Parliament never goes down the path of extending free time, that part of the report will not be completely discarded, and the Government and the Parliament will have regard to what is happening with front organisations. During the Joh for Canberra push, which occurred during the last election, the millions of dollars which went into the front company known as Kaldeal Co. Pty Ltd could never be traced back to its source under the existing law. In fact, it is still uncertain as to what will happen to that money, despite the scrutiny of Commissioner Fitzgerald and his report in Queensland. Those issues, which have occurred in a number of States and in a number of elections, should be addressed by this Parliament. The Bill introduces both minor and major reforms. It represents a reasonable package of changes and should be supported.

         —It is disturbing to note that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) said that the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill relates to the first and second reports of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform that were presented to the last Parliament. What he did not say was that the first report was delivered to the Parliament in November 1985, and it has taken in excess of four years to get the legislation into this place. The second report was presented in December 1986. It has taken three and over four years respectively to get some very simple changes made. The fact is that in the Senate it is up to the Government to list Bills for debate, and it has been in the Government's hands to list this Bill for debate at any time. The fact that it has languished in the Senate since April 1988 merely means that at no time has the Government given this Bill any priority.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill relates to a large number of areas and I would like to touch on just two. They relate to redistribution and electoral rolls. It is true that the redistribution system in this country is divorced from the political process-that, in itself, is very good-and that we have an independent umpire. But the independent umpire works on a set of rules given to him. He has a street map and that street map is section 66 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That tells the redistribution committee what it can take into account when it makes a redistribution. The fairness of the outcome will depend on the fairness of the rules that the committee is given to make that redistribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Redistribution is based on two figures: the enrolment at the time of the redistribution and the projected enrolment 3 1/2 years hence. It is meant to be very precise-a plus or minus 2 per cent tolerance. That is really just a trick because both figures on which it is based are flawed; hence the outcome must be flawed. I will give an example of what happened in my own State. The first figure is the enrolment at the time of redistribution. In the seat of Melbourne Ports, a very mobile seat, between the 1981 and 1986 censuses over 58 per cent of the population changed address. Between May 1987 and May 1988, 6,202 people went off the rolls; that is, 10 per cent of the voting population vanished. They were on the roll for this marginal seat in the 1987 election and should not have been. The enrolment 3 1/2 years out is the other figure that is supposed to be exact.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, of the 39 seats we had in my own State of Victoria, only 18 were within a 2 per cent margin of the predicted figure, 3 1/2 years out. In May 1988, at the time the last redistribution was being considered, the average Liberal Party seat had 1,397 more voters than the average Labor Party seat. It is possible that that could happen by chance. In fact, a statistical test can be applied, and there is a 7.2 per cent possibility that would happen by chance. The fact is that the figures were significantly wrong and they affected one party. Did this make any difference? One area of particular concern was the seat of McEwen which was spot-on with the prediction, but it is next to Indi on one side, where the population increase was underestimated, and Scullin on the other side, where the population increase was overestimated. Scullin was 10 per cent under quota, the lowest enrolment of any mainland seat in the country, and Indi was over quota. If those quotas had been correct, McEwen would have given to Scullin some of Broadmeadows and the outer areas of Melbourne that vote 70 per cent Labor, moved up the Hume Highway and taken some of the rural areas of Indi; then we might have had a different result in that seat. I am not suggesting any collusion; I am not suggesting that the redistribution committee did this on purpose. But it shows that when the figures are seriously flawed it can have a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        Three other aspects of redistribution are of concern to me. The first is the frequency. A redistribution is severely disruptive. In Victoria we have had two redistributions this decade. This has happened for the first time since Federation. We have had three redistributions in 12 years. The difficulty and disruption that that process causes is enormous. My second concern about the process of redistribution is the fact that section 66 (3) (b) was changed so as to remove population decline as a consideration that could be taken into account when abolishing a seat. I thought that that was quite strange. It would seem pretty obvious that if a seat were to be abolished why not abolish it where there is the biggest population decline? On the road map, on the rules that the Australian Electoral Commission have to follow when making redistributions, population decline was taken out. I have been trying to find out why this has occurred. I looked at the seats in Australia which have had a population decline between the last two censuses. They are in the following order: Scullin-Labor; Melbourne Ports-Labor; Gellibrand-Labor; Melbourne-Labor; Banks-Labor; Wills-Labor; Batman-Labor; Newcastle-Labor; Hinkler-Labor. The interesting thing is that six of those seats are metropolitan Melbourne seats that all border each other. Interestingly, there was a redistribution in Victoria last year. Victoria was the area that had the greatest population decline and, it could be argued strongly, should have lost a seat had that been in the Act. But it was removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third matter that causes me some concern is the issue of Federation seats. While this is not specifically in the Act, it is something that the Commission has said that it takes into account; it tries not to abolish Federation seats. If we look at Federation seats in areas with a population decline we find that six out of eight are Labor-Melbourne, Melbourne Ports, Newcastle, Hindmarsh, Brisbane and Denison. The only Federation Liberal seats where there is a population decline are Kooyong and Moreton. Taking that into consideration, it means that many inner city Labor seats around the country that are suffering population declines are Federation seats and thus safe. To me that does not seem fair.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second area of this Bill which I will speak about is the state of the electoral rolls. I will also talk about my own seat of Chisholm because, like my colleague opposite, mine is a very marginal seat. His seat is now the most marginal in the country; before the last election mine was. The electoral roll is the fundamental and basic tool of democracy. Its integrity and accuracy are absolutely essential for democracy. This Bill makes provision for the electoral rolls to be printed and distributed two years after the last election. I welcome that; it is a timely introduction. It is a pity that the report on the 1987 Federal election, which was in fact released six months ago and to which the Government has not yet seen worthy to give us a reply, could not have been looked at because these recommendations are out of date from the report we put down six months ago. In this report we make further suggestions that the electoral rolls that are used in the process of an election, and are thus surplus, could be given to members immediately after the election. That would go a long way to giving members of parliament their basic tool of trade. It also suggests that one copy of a certified list of voters of a division be given to all candidates after the close of rolls. If the Government's record on timing on this Bill is applied, we would be waiting another four years for that to be implemented. My only consolation is that a new government might seek to implement it a little bit earlier.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is concern about the accuracy of the rolls. This is not something we raise lightly; it is a genuine concern. I am sure the Minister has read the 1987 Federal election report. We recommended that for the next Federal election the Australian Electoral Commission conduct a thorough examination of those persons added to the rolls of two marginal seats before the election and those persons deleted from the roll of the same division after the election. One division should be a Government held division and the other an Opposition held division. The reason for this is really pretty simple. I will give an example of my own electorate. In Chisholm, in the three weeks between the calling of the election and the closing of the rolls, there were 2,472 additions. This is in a seat that had a majority of 170 votes. After the election I wrote to every person who had put their name on the roll in the three weeks before the election. Ten per cent-240-were returned `Not at this address'. In fact, the treasurer of my Federal electorate committee got a letter addressed to the person from whom he had purchased his house five years previously; before the election this person had actually re-enrolled. Letters kept coming back with `Not here for one year', `Not here for two years', `Not here for five years'. These were not people turning up on polling day and saying, `I think I am down for Chisholm'; these were people who physically went in and re-enrolled for an address at which they did not live-in a seat with a 170 vote majority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another area of concern is the functioning of declaration votes. Again, I will give an example of my own seat of Chisholm. Between 1972 and 1984 we had a fairly steady number of declaration votes: forty-two was the minimum and 88 was the maximum. In 1987 we had 224 declaration votes in a seat with a 170 vote majority. If one wishes to apply a statistical test to that, the 1987 result is 11 standard deviations away from the results of the past 15 years or, to put it in simple terms, the chances of that happening by chance are less than one in a million.
       </para>
       <para>
        I purchased my house in the electorate in October 1986, and the election was in July 1987. In July 1987 the person from whom I had purchased my house walked into a polling booth in Cairns and said, `I'm on the roll for Chisholm'. In fact, he had been removed by a habitation review six months earlier. He said `No, I still live in Chisholm. I live at this address', which was my address. `I demand to be able to vote and I demand to go back on the roll', both of which occurred. He probably voted for me, but that is not the point. The point is that in the trade-off between a user-friendly system and integrity and confidence in that system we are now so user-friendly that we cannot have complete confidence about the integrity.
       </para>
       <para>
        We used to have a three-month provision; that is, when a person went to vote, if he had not lived at the address for three months, he could not vote in that subdivision. That is not an arbitrary figure; that three months figure comprised the 30 days to live in the subdivision, 21 days to enrol and process it and then the 30 days from the declaration of the election to the polling date. When this three-month provision was removed, we have an example of what happened from Mr Trefor Owen, who is the operations manager of the Australian Electoral Commission in Victoria. He made a submission to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 1987 election in which he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The elimination of the three-month question puts electors who have left their address into the following categories: electors who have not been removed from the roll by objection, even though they have left the address-
       </para>
       <para>
        and they vote-
       </para>
       <para>
        and electors who have been removed from the roll by objection because they left the address more than three months ago but claim a provisional vote-
       </para>
       <para>
        and they vote. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of the elimination of the three-month question and the lack of other investigation of declaration votes is that we allow people not removed by review activity to cast a vote although they may have left the address several years earlier and it means we allow anyone who requests a provisional vote to have one and reinstate anyone removed by objection from the roll even though figures indicate that 90 per cent of them no longer live in the electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        This was said by the operations manager for the Electoral Commission in Victoria. He went on to say:

        There are several reasons why people maintain enrolment for an old address: laziness, not wishing to be found, and a feeling that their vote is worth more in a marginal seat. These people may be able to influence an election in an electorate that they don't even live in and this is a cause for concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        So they are my concerns about the roll. Some of the stories may be anecdotal, but they are all verifiable, and we have not done anything to clean up these problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        My colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) foreshadowed amendments that will be moved in the committee stage and I would like to talk about my concern and support for one of those amendments. Two-party preferred voting did give the Australian Labor Party a majority in the last Federal election but it is a little different if we look at State elections. In New South Wales, if the Liberal Party had received anything less than 54 per cent of the vote it would have lost. In Victoria the Liberals received 50.5 per cent of the two-party preferred vote and still lost. They need 51.3 per cent before they win. In Western Australia the Labor Party, on a two-party preferred vote, with all the preferences exhausted, received 47.62 per cent of the vote and has a three-seat majority.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment that my colleague has foreshadowed would fix this problem, because in talking about bias and proportionment there are two concepts that are quite different which people confuse. There is a concept of equality and there is a concept of fairness. The concept of equality relates to malproportionment and the concept of fairness relates to bias. Surely, fairness in an electoral system means that the party that gets 50 per cent of the vote plus one after preferences should form government. Nick Greiner needed 54 per cent to form government, and that is far worse than what happened in Queensland. In Western Australia Barry MacKinnon needs 53.2 per cent of the vote to win government. We have heard no cries of gerrymander from the Labor Party about those two States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments that have been foreshadowed would mean that it would be impossible to rig the system in a manner which would unfairly advantage one party or another. If this Government is really fair dinkum about the high and lofty ideals that it puts up about one vote one value, it would take this amendment to remove bias from the system once and for all. To sum up, there are some good things in this Bill, although it is disturbing that it has taken over four years since the first report to get it here. There are some areas we disagree with, and we have foreshadowed that we will move amendments in that regard, but in the end the Bill is disappointing in that this really is just a charade. The Bill pretends fairness but the fairness is not really there. In the balance between a system that is user-friendly and a system that is secure and has high integrity, we have gone too far and have made it so easy to vote that we have introduced significant capacity for fraud.

         —People who have spoken for the Opposition in this debate have been critical of the fact that the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill is now before the House after a great delay since it was introduced into the Senate. I think someone suggested that Santa Claus was quicker on his deliveries than the Government and the Parliament. If anyone is to blame, I might suggest to those opposite that it is the House whose colour closely matches that worn by Santa Claus, because it was the Senate that took almost 18 months to deal with this legislation.

         —I hate to tell the honourable member (Dr Wooldridge) for Chisholm this, but the Government does not have a majority in the Senate. As much as we might like to bump things up on the list of priorities in the Senate, if the Opposition and the Australian Democrats refuse to sit longer periods, refuse to sit later at night, if Opposition members demand that each of them has the right to speak at great length on every piece of legislation, then we cannot get important pieces of legislation such as this through the Senate. It is a disgrace that this has taken 18 months to get from the second reading speech in the Senate to a final vote in the Senate. I think it is quite clear who is at fault, and it is not the Government.

        This legislation was introduced into the Australian Parliament while we were sitting in the provisional Parliament House at the bottom of the hill. It is the last such legislation to be, hopefully, passed-certainly debated-in this chamber. On those grounds it is quite historic. The honourable member for Hume, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Fife), made a number of comments about the principle of one vote one value and said that he thought there was still too much variation between electorates. He said that, while the Australian Electoral Commission, when it drew up the boundaries which apply in States such as New South Wales in 1984, aimed to have a tolerance of only 2 per cent 3 1/2 years into the cycle, he believed that that variation had not been met, that that tolerance had been exceeded and that at the next election the tolerance will be too great, in his opinion. I am sure that if we took the figures for fast growing seats such as McPherson or Werriwa we would see that yes, there has been very rapid growth because that is where people have been moving to and building homes in very large numbers. But surely the law as it now stands does all it can to try to reduce that variation to a minimum.
       </para>
       <para>
        When a redistribution is carried out, the fastest growing seats start off with an enrolment which is up to 10 per cent below the average. The declining seats start off the redistribution cycle with an enrolment of up to 10 per cent above the average. As we move into the seven year cycle all of the electorates get closer together. As we get to the end of the seven year cycle they overtake each other and move further apart. But surely that is better than the old system. In the bad old days the Country Party rigged the law so that there was a weighting of plus or minus 20 per cent to the rural areas. It argued on the grounds that members of rural seats had great difficulty in representing their electorates because of the distances and the other special problems in rural areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to place a bet that the honourable member for Hume very adequately represents his electorate, even though it covers a very large area and requires him to travel great distances and spend a great deal of his time in motor vehicles getting around. The honourable member for Chisholm has the luxury of being able to move around his electorate a lot more quickly. I do not think that that means the electors of Hume should have more voting power than the electors of Chisholm simply because one group of people happens to live in a rural area and the other group in the city. I know we have gone through that debate many times and it is about to reach a crescendo in Queensland as the Government looks at the State's laws on electoral matters and rural weightings. We can be very proud of the fact that at the Federal level we now try to make sure that there is one vote one value. We go to great lengths to try to make sure that all of the electorates have as close as possible the same number of electors. That is good. Just before I finish on redistributions, I note that the honourable member for Hume seemed to say that there is still too much variation, while the honourable member for Chisholm said that redistributions cause a great amount of disturbance and that they should not be carried out too often. There does seem to be a bit of a contradiction on that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both the honourable member for Chisholm and the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the honourable member for Hume, were very critical of the current boundaries. They argued that there is not one vote one value because while the coalition obtained-to use the words of the honourable member of Hume-a majority of the votes, it did not win a majority of the seats. In fact, the honourable member for Hume pointed out that the Liberal and National parties obtained 46.07 per cent of the primary vote while the Australian Labor Party received only 45.83 per cent of the primary vote. The first thing that stands out, of course, is that while those opposite received 46 per cent of the vote, it is not a majority; it is only 46 per cent. Parties such as the Australian Democrats and other minor groups, of course, obtain the rest.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Australia we have something called preferential voting. It has been supported very strongly by the conservative parties. Since they often have three-cornered contests, it is very important for them. For example, in a seat where the Liberal candidate polls more than the National Party candidate it is very important for them that those National Party candidate votes be distributed. The preferences usually go to the Liberal candidate. They then have a chance of beating the Labor candidate, even though the Labor candidate may have polled more primary votes than either the Liberal or the National. People such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition argue that that is important because it means that while the National Party candidate has been eliminated his second preference is taken into account.
       </para>
       <para>
        I give the example of the Northern Territory where, at the last election, the Labor candidate obtained only 28,000 votes. The Country Liberal Party candidate obtained 21,600 votes and the National Party candidate obtained 10,200 votes. While it is true that the combination of the National Party and the Liberal Party candidates' votes adds up to a majority, when one looks at the figures one sees that there was quite a significant leakage from the National Party to the Labor Party when the candidates' preferences were distributed. So by simply adding the primary vote of the National Party to the primary vote of the Liberal Party and saying that that is more than the Labor Party's primary vote one is fiddling the figures. The figures are crook because one has not taken into account the fact that when a Liberal or a National Party candidate comes third he or she has to be eliminated and his or her preferences are distributed, with some going to the Labor Party. In fact, the Labor Party obtained a majority of the two-party preferred vote. It is just crook manipulating statistics to simply add the primary vote of the Liberal Party to the primary vote of the National Party. I hope that in any future discussion on that those opposite will take that into account.
       </para>
       <para>
        Opposition members have said that while there is no malapportionment at the Federal level because we have tried to make sure that the electorates are the same size, there can still be a gerrymander. That is true. But we can be proud of the fact that at the Federal level we have independent Electoral Commissioners, who are not subject to the political influences that those opposite might be suggesting.

In fact, when one looks at the figures for the 1984 redistribution, one sees that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) could have won a majority at the 1984 election with less than half the two-party preferred vote. Those opposite did better than the Labor Party in the 1984 redistribution. So it is a bit hard for them to allege that the boundaries were drawn up by the independent Commission in a way that helped the Labor Party.

        The Opposition is putting forward an amendment which suggests that the Electoral Commissioners have to take into account the political lay of the land when doing a redistribution. They have to make sure that if one party obtains a majority of the votes at the following election its wins government. That sounds good.
       </para>
       <para>
        Never before have we suggested to the Electoral Commissioners doing a redistribution that they take any account at all of how people vote. Sir John Carrick often raised this matter on the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. He would ask Dr Colin Hughes, `Do you ever take into account the political statistics, the electoral statistics, for whether an area votes Labor or Liberal or anything else?', and Dr Hughes would say, `No, never'. And here is an amendment from the Opposition saying that it will force the Electoral Commissioners to sit down and do their sums for the electorates that they are proposing; to sit down and work out if they can alter an electorate to help Labor, Liberal or some other party. To force the Electoral Commissioners to get involved in that sort of area is an outrageous suggestion to put forward to this Parliament, I hope the Opposition might reconsider that in time to come. I wanted to touch on some other matters but given the fact that time is short I conclude my remarks. I commend the legislation to the House.

         —In the spirit of short speeches I will follow suit. I just wish to follow up on something raised by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). He referred to the increase in the number of sectional votes in his electorate during the last election. In recent times I have had cause to check out this increase. As I understand it, a person who might have lived in electorate X more than 10 or 12 years ago is now entitled to go along-the honourable member for Chisholm referred to his former home owner living in Cairns-to a polling booth on the day in any part of Australia and claim a vote for that former electorate. The manual that is now being put out by the Electoral Commission specifically states that if that person's name can be found on the former role that vote has to be accepted.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Chisholm, being reasonably new in this place, accused the Government or the Electoral Commission of being elector friendly. That would have to be, with great respect, the observations of a reasonably fresh-faced new arrival. I believe it has been done absolutely deliberately. These votes invariably favour the Australian Labor Party by a huge percentage because Liberal voters are more likely to have a solid root somewhere and be enrolled than-and I do not put them down when I say this-those who are likely to be more itinerant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Chisholm also referred to the fact that people are deliberately not enrolling in new electorates because in the electorates that they have come from, which are marginally close, their vote is worth more by staying unenrolled in the new electorate and retaining the right to claim a vote in the old electorate. I am not necessarily accusing the Government of having dreamt this one up but I would not put anything past any government when it comes to wanting to win elections. A party can look good, pure and simple, and can get away with it. All sides indulge in such tactics and play this game.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Electoral Commission is going to start creating rules like this we will be in a situation where candidates in marginal electorates can say to people who are moving to a blue ribbon seat, whether Labor or Liberal, `Hey, I'm going to be facing a battle come the next election. I suggest, if you're going to shift away from our electorate into another electorate that is pretty strong one way or the other, don't waste your vote. Don't enrol there; just keep the vote up your sleeve until election day and go along and claim a sectional vote and you will be able to help X party hold this seat'. That is what is going to happen.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) has a slight smile on his face. He may be innocent in all this because he has a blue ribbon seat and does not have to look at what goes on. This is what he is creating. I say to the Electoral Commission, `If you are going to parade yourself as being true and honest, do not correct what was a little bit of discrepancy and unevenness in application by various returning officers. Do not go about correcting a lack of consistency in the application of the rules by creating a whole new field for rort'. It is very, very easy for anyone now to go and do what I outlined a moment ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        I go back to the core of it all: the returning officer for a particular electoral division is now instructed to go back to the old rolls and if a person's name appeared at some time in the past that vote has to be accepted. It is very, very clever. These sectional votes almost invariably heavily favour the Labor Party. In my electorate-I have a margin of just under one per cent-my opponent could now be saying to those of his party who are shifting all over Queensland, `Do not enrol where you go; keep the barrel of the gun pointed back at the seat of Moreton'.

         —in reply-Firstly, I thank the speakers who have participated in this short debate. I want to quickly take up a couple of points made by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife). The first one is his accusation that we are culpable because we are putting the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill through all its stages today. The second is that there has been a delay until this point. The facts of what he said and what I have just reiterated are correct, but I and the Government cannot take any responsibility for what has happened in the Senate. I make it quite clear that I pushed the people who run the Senate very hard to get the Bill dealt with and here today so that we could deal with a Bill that has been in the Senate for far too long. I cannot accept responsibility for the time-wasting procedures of certain people in the three Opposition parties in the Senate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The most controversial view put by the shadow Minister was about the amendment that he apparently proposes to move requiring the redistribution committee to take account of the political effects of a redistribution, that is, it should be based upon the votes that were cast at the previous election. I think that is an incredible proposition because, in effect, when we think about it, the Opposition is saying that the electoral redistribution committee should decide, on the basis of votes cast at the previous election, who should win a particular seat. When we think about it that is an outrageous proposition. Even if this action is allegedly undertaken in the interests of getting results so that the party that gets the highest percentage of votes wins the election, it is still asking the redistribution committee to look for a given result, even if it is in the interests of something that we could all support. But it is a case of the end result not justifying the means because of the scope for political interference in a redistribution. Surely, that should be clear to the House, to the nation and even to the Opposition. I will expand a little more on that if the spokesperson for the Opposition moves the amendment in the committee stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only other point that I want to take up concerns the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune. Several people, including the shadow Minister, have referred to that report. To summarise the recommendations, it put up a package to ban advertisements in the electronic media after the writs are issued during an election campaign. It also called for much more stringent, even full, disclosure of donations and gifts to parties and third parties. The shadow Minister claimed, as he discussed those issues, that the Opposition had forced the Government back on that issue. That is not true. That was a report from a committee of this Parliament. The day after it was made public I said in this House, on questioning from the Opposition as to what our attitude was, that we would examine that report and its recommendations and then make our position known. That is exactly what we did.
       </para>
       <para>
        I gave it the fullest possible scrutiny and examination on behalf of the Government. Then I said that at that point of time, given the proximity of the election at which the Government will no doubt be elected to a fourth term, no action would be taken on the package. I made that clear. I also want to make it clear to the House, and to all constituents in Australia who actively considered it-it was a very controversial report-that we were not forced into anything. We gave it the fullest possible scrutiny and then we said that we were not going to take any action on that package at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as more stringent disclosure requirements in the Bill are concerned, we could examine later whether there ought to be more stringent disclosure requirements. Three factors are involved here which are drawn out in that report. The first is the appallingly high cost of advertisements on television. The second is that, even with the best intentions, it is well known that in the Commonwealth Electoral Act-this has been made public recently by the outgoing Electoral Commissioner, Colin Hughes-there are certain circumstances where full disclosure of donations to political parties is not required. The third factor is that there is overwhelming evidence, particularly in Queensland and even in New South Wales, that certain companies and business people are prepared to make quite large contributions to political parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact that those three points that I have just put forward are unarguable leads me to believe that, in the calmer atmosphere of the Government's fourth term, there could be a case-I am not talking about bans on advertisements; I am talking about disclosure-for a calm examination of the adequacy of the current disclosure provisions in the Act. But I and the Government certainly took on board the remarks of the Opposition and other people in the community that it was not the correct time, even though there may be a case to look at the current disclosure provisions, to be rushing at anything in a totally pre-election situation. If anything is ever to be one on disclosure, it ought to be done in a calm atmosphere so that we can, if we can get consensus on what is required, make the electoral Act as full of probity as it possibly can be.

       <para>
        Our paragraph seeks to add subparagraph (vi) in the following terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the extent to which the representation in the House of Representatives, of the people of the State or Territory reflected the views of the electors as evidenced by a majority of the formal votes counted towards the election of candidates in the State or Territory at the last general election or in the general election that occurred since the last redistribution of the State or Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        I referred to this matter in the second reading debate. We have drawn attention to the fact that, in the 1987 Federal election, the Australian Labor Party polled 45.8 per cent of first preference votes, which was down from the 47.5 per cent it had polled on the previous occasion, but its representation rose from 82 to 86 seats. The Liberal Party polled 34.6 per cent, having increased from 34.4 per cent in the previous election, but its representation fell from 45 to 43 seats. The National Party polled 11.5 per cent, up from 10.6 per cent which it had polled on the previous occasion, and its representation fell from 21 to 19 seats. In other words, there was a swing to the coalition parties of something in the order of one per cent. As a result of that swing the coalition parties actually lost four seats.

        We are proposing this amendment because we believe that simply drawing to the attention of the Australian Electoral Commission the fundamental principle that, as far as possible, the outcome of the election overall ought to reflect the views of the electorate overall is a fair and proper thing to be said. We have, therefore, cast this amendment as one of the factors-the sixth factor-to which the Redistribution Committee shall give due consideration when it is in the process of actually determining the electoral boundaries. Because we believe that it is a fair principle, it should be written as a fair principle into the legislation.

         —As I understand it, this amendment requires the Redistribution Committee, in making its proposed redistribution, to take into account in some way the possible political effects of a redistribution. According to what has been said in the Senate and here, the amendment flows from the concern of members of the Opposition that, in the 1987 election, they lost seats despite the fact that there was a swing to them; that is, in two-party preferred terms.

        The purported aim of the amendment seems to require that greater steps be taken, in terms of Commonwealth legislation, to ensure that a party winning in excess of 50 per cent of the votes is entitled to more than 50 per cent of the seats. But this amendment is totally defective. It ignores the fact that the redistribution process has several stages. The proposed redistribution promulgated by the Redistribution Committee is subject to a subsequent objection process which may involve a series of public hearings before the augmented Australian Electoral Commission, which makes the final determination of the boundaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment, as it stands, would only require the redistribution committee-and not the Commission-to take account of the possible political impact of redistributions. Thus, the augmented Electoral Commission would be justified in refusing to allow evidence at public hearings relating to, or to consider in its final determination the political impact of, the proposed redistribution, except to the extent that it could be demonstrated that a particular recommendation of the redistribution committee had been motivated purely by its impact on the political equity of the proposed redistribution, in which case the augmented Commission would probably be required to overturn that recommendation. The net effect of this would be dramatic changes to the proposed redistribution accompanied by very prolonged hearings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment is so poorly drafted that it is not at all clear what the real intention is and what the redistribution committee would be required to do. It is not even clear whether only voting patterns at the most recent election preceding the redistribution are to be taken into account, whether voting patterns at all elections since the previous redistribution are to be heeded or, if the two are contradictory, which should be given priority. The amendment certainly does not reflect with any precision whatsoever the intention expressed by the Opposition previously. I refer in particular to what Senator Puplick said during the second reading debate. The intention is, in any case, one which ought not be pursued. Under single member constituencies it is always possible that a party with a majority of votes will win a minority of the seats.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the absence of blatant malapportionment or a deliberate gerrymander, with malapportionment impossible at the Commonwealth level under current law and the fact that a deliberate gerrymander would be most unlikely-and has never been alleged to date-such occurrences are essentially random products of the pattern of a swing in a particular election. There is no reliable methodology known for predicting such random occurrences and preventing them. The proposed approach of determining boundaries for the future on the basis of voting patterns in the past has no objective basis. Indeed, the one thing that can be said with any reliability about the results of the next election is that they will differ from the results per se, seat by seat, of all previous ones. It would be demeaning to electors to regard them as mere ciphers, anyway. The possibility of applying a criterion such as the one proposed here was considered by the first quasi-judicial redistribution body-the South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission-in its 1976 report. Even that long ago it was rejected on a number of grounds, including the variability of voting patterns between elections, and that view was endorsed by the augmented Commission conducting the 1984 and 1989 Commonwealth redistributions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will let this be the final point: the most undesirable feature of this amendment is that it would throw into complete jeopardy the apolitical nature of the redistribution process. Certainly it may be anticipated that State public servants, such as the Surveyor-General and the Auditor-General, not to mention the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, who is a Federal Court judge, would be very reluctant to serve on redistribution bodies which were required to make decisions that were so overtly political. For all of these reasons this Government will not accept this amendment.

         —I would like to speak in support of the proposed clause. I find it difficult to understand what the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) is saying. The fact is that the Opposition is trying to make the redistribution process apolitical because, as I explained in my contribution to the second reading debate, the augmented Electoral Commission has a set of road rules which it has to follow. The Electoral Commission might be independent but if those road rules are designed to produce a biased result, even with the best of will, there will still be a biased result.

        The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) claimed that after the 1984 redistribution the Liberal Party would have won a majority of seats with a minority of the vote. That is not correct. In the 1984 election the Australian Labor Party got 51.8 per cent of the vote, it had a 16-seat majority, and the Liberal Party would have needed 50.3 per cent of the vote to win a majority of seats. Plus or minus 0.3 per cent is pretty fair, so I correct that fact.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason why we are proposing this clause is that there is a significant capacity in single member electorates to have a bias one way or the other. This is seen at a State level in Western Australia where the Labor Party, with a full distribution of preferences, got only 47.6 per cent of the vote; in New South Wales where the Labor Party, with a full distribution of preferences, would have won with 46 per cent; and in Victoria where the Labor Party, with a full distribution of preferences, got less than 50 per cent of the vote and more than 50 per cent of the seats. We are not saying that this is the only or the paramount factor, but my experience in the Victorian redistribution last year when we brought this up is that time and time again it was said to us, `We cannot take this into consideration, no matter how compelling your arguments are; it is not in the Act'. To have this provision as one of the factors would redress that imbalance.

        I should explain this amendment. Proposed section 62 of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act makes amendments to section 226 of the principal Act, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Section 226 of the principal Act relates to the way in which votes are taken and dealt with in hospitals that are polling places and where mobile booths are in use. Section 226 deals with provisions which are covered in sections 224 and 225 of the principal Act. As I have said, they both deal with mobile booths and hospitals that are polling places. The current regime provides that candidates are precluded from entering hospitals, special hospitals, nursing homes or similar institutions for canvassing once the writs for an election have been issued. Indeed, subsection 5 (a) of section 226 of the principal Act states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the reference in that sub-section to polling day and to all days to which the polling is adjourned were a reference to the period commencing on the day of the issue of the writ and ending at the expiration of polling day or, if the polling is adjourned, the expiration of the last day to which the polling is adjourned . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition amendment proposes that subsection 5 (a) of section 226 should be deleted. It is our view that this is a fair and reasonable provision, given the expanded nature of activities taking place within hospitals and designated institutions for the purposes of polling, and the extended nature of the activities that are to take place related to other hospitals. Clauses 60 and 61 make some amendments to the way in which mobile booths are to operate or be operated in hospitals that are polling places and other hospitals. We say that the period from the issue of the writ until polling day is too long a period for candidates to be precluded from canvassing, particularly because increasing numbers of persons are likely to be voting in hospitals, special hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions. We believe that people in those areas are just as entitled to visits by candidates and that, provided candidates obtain the permission of the hospital authorities, they should not be precluded by the Act from entering hospitals for the purposes of promoting their candidacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have moved the amendment for that reason. I believe that it would be fair and proper to extend both to candidates and to the people who are residents of these nursing homes, hospitals, special hospitals or similar institutions the right to be contacted by a candidate during the period from the issue of the writ until polling day.

         —The Government cannot agree to this amendment, for the following reason: The original purpose of the non-canvassing provisions was to do away with the old system of postal voting in hospitals and nursing homes which was seen to give rise to extensive opportunities for corruption. As a result of its review of the operation of those provisions the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform proposed amendments which are contained elsewhere in this Bill to allow postal voting in hospitals, limited distribution of how-to-vote cards, and to prohibit hospital staff from influencing the vote of an elector. The full repeal of the non-canvassing provisions was not recommended presumably because, in conjunction with the renewal of the right to a postal vote, it would, in effect, cause a reversion to the pre-1984 situation of widespread perceptions of corruption. For that reason the Government will not support the amendment.

       Some honourable members have to catch planes at 4.15 p.m. There are Royal Australian Air Force crews on standby who deserve a Christmas as much as anybody else. This matter has been well canvassed in the Senate prior to this point, and I think that, no matter what might be said in debate, honourable members on both sides will receive this proposal with reasonable equanimity.

        —That was a pitiful apology on the part of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). The Leader of the House used the words-I know that they are the appropriate words from standing orders-that the time allotted for the remaining stages of this Bill be until 3.15 p.m. this day. That is less than an hour, but I think members of the House ought to be reminded and the public ought to be aware that the Minister was saying in effect that the total amount of time available for consideration of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill will be less than one hour. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has not yet made his second reading speech; it has to be responded to by the shadow Minister on the Opposition side; and I understand some 10 or 12 members from both sides of the House want to speak. The proceedings of the House today and yesterday have been a real charade. We have been brought back unnecessarily. We have been brought back because the Government has not been able to arrange its business. It could not run a fowl house let alone a Parliament. It is turning this place into a comic opera show. I will not delay the House by further protesting, but members of the Government, and particularly the Leader of the House, ought to be ashamed of what they are doing to this institution.

        That the Bill be now read a second time.
       </para>
       <para>
        In moving the second reading on behalf of the Government I am very pleased to advise members of the House of the Government's decision to move to ban the advertising of all tobacco products in the print media. This will be achieved through the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisement (Prohibition) Bill 1989, which was introduced into the Parliament in the Senate by Senator Powell on 31 August 1989. The Government successfully moved 22 amendments to the Bill on 7 December 1989 and The Bill was subsequently passed by the Senate on that day.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is the latest in a series of initiatives by this Government to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia. Achievements to date include a ban on smoking in Commonwealth buildings; a ban on smoking on domestic airline flights-in addition, Qantas Airways Ltd has introduced regular smoke-free flights to New Zealand; a ban on smoking on all federally registered coaches, which has been followed by bans being progressively introduced for State and Territory registered coaches and buses; and rotating health warnings on tobacco packets, achieved in cooperation with the States. The Federal Government has banned the sale in Australia of chewing tobacco and oral snuff. In January next year, the Federal Government will launch a major multimedia campaign to discourage smoking amongst young women. This will promote positive images of young women showing that fun, success and sophistication do not require them to take up smoking.
       </para>
       <para>
        The way has been set for Federal action to restrict tobacco advertising in the print media, by several of the States which have implemented legislation to control other forms of tobacco advertising. These include advertising on billboards, hoardings and cinemas, which are more appropriately dealt with under State legislation. I intended to praise those State governments for their actions but, in order to give as many honourable members as possible an opportunity to speak, I will not detail the work that has been done in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia in particular.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australians are generally aware that smoking is bad for their health. It is interesting to look at the changes in patterns of tobacco consumption over the years. From the 1940s when about 70 per cent of men smoked, to the 1970s when about 40 per cent of men smoked and 29 per cent of women smoked, to the present as we approach the 1990s, we see that smoking by men has declined to about 33 per cent, while smoking by women has remained relatively static since the 1970s-that is, at approximately 30 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        These figures are averages for the entire Australian population. On examination of population subgroups we find that smoking rates among young people are the highest of any age group in the Australian population. Within the young people group, young women are smoking more than young men. This is a matter of considerable concern. Young women aged between 20 and 24 have the highest smoking rate of all Australian adult smokers with 41 per cent of women in this age group smoking.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, young girls aged 12 to 15 years form the group with the greatest trend of experimentation and uptake of smoking. The smoking rates of young women are of great concern and seem to reflect the fact that they comprise the group which is the particular target for many cigarette advertisements. In 1988, out of a total of $10.7m which was spent on tobacco advertising in magazines, $6m was directed to women's magazines. Three-quarters of adults who smoke started when they were adolescents. If present trends continue over 250,000 boys and 159,000 girls who are now under 14 will die before their time because they smoked. These figures underscore the fact that, although much has been achieved, more needs to be done to reduce smoking.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the forum of the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, I first raised the possibility of the Federal Government acting to ban tobacco advertising in the print media in October 1988. At that time a number of States and Territories had considered a print media advertising ban, and this issue was firmly on the national agenda, but it was clear that action could not be taken by any State in isolation. If only one State did not cooperate, the other States, even acting in concert, would face significant practical and legal difficulties in bringing about such a ban. Given this difficulty for a State based ban, I offered at the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy to take a proposal for a Federal ban to Cabinet if the States agreed. This was followed by a year of negotiations seeking to achieve this agreement, and I must acknowledge the key role played by the Victorian Government in these negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        It became clear during the year that not only was there significant support for this move among the States, there was also strong public support for the ban. This public support is reflected in Senator Powell's introduction of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill. This Bill, in its original form, had a number of significant defects and was overly grandiose in its scope. Nevertheless, the main thrust of the Bill appeared to me to be sufficiently in tune with public opinion and the policy discussions of the Federal and State governments for it to be a useful vehicle to introduce the ban. The Government supported the Bill, albeit in amended form, because, as with other drug problems, we believe that this issue should not be the subject of partisan political battles.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the Government announced its intention to ban the advertising of tobacco products in the print media, we have been overwhelmed by the amount of support received. The Australian Medical Association has commended the Government's action and has recognised that Federal legislation is an essential backup of action being undertaken by several States and Territories to control other forms of tobacco advertising. Other professional and community organisations have declared their support for the ban including the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Australian Cancer Society, Action on Smoking and Health, the National Heart Foundation, and the Australian Association for Adolescent Health.
       </para>
       <para>
        The professional and public support is in accord with the opinion of experts around the world. The World Health Organisation first recommended total prohibition of all forms of tobacco advertising a decade ago. It has reiterated this recommendation many times since, the latest occasion being at the Sixth World Conference on Smoking and Health in 1987 which recommended that all forms of tobacco advertising in all media should be banned in all countries. In 1980 the National Health and Medical Research Council, the major health advisory body to governments in Australia, fully supported the recommendation of the World Health Organisation that there should be a total prohibition on all forms of tobacco advertising. The Commonwealth health Ministers at their recent meeting in Melbourne also called for governments to move towards a complete ban on all advertising of tobacco products. In addition, I have been inundated with letters of support from members of the community who have also recognised that a ban on tobacco advertising is an essential element of any effective strategy to reduce tobacco consumption. Evidence of the strong community support is also seen in the results of recent surveys conducted independently in five States over the last two years. These show support for tobacco advertising to be banned in the print media ranging from 70 per cent in New South Wales to 82 per cent in South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I congratulate the Opposition on also deciding to support the Bill, just as my Party, when in opposition, supported the ban on television and radio advertising of tobacco. I realise that the Opposition did express some concern when the current Bill was debated in the Senate about whether this ban would set an undesirable precedent for advertising other products. I point out that tobacco is a unique product in that there is no safe level or form of use, whereas substances such as alcohol are dangerous only if abused. Moderate, responsible consumption of alcohol by normal, healthy adults has a legitimate social use in Australia today. The national health policy on alcohol of the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy acknowledges this, and commits the State, Territory and Federal governments to ensuring that the marketing and advertising of alcohol encourages responsible use.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been several dissenting views which oppose a ban on tobacco advertising. These views, held in the main by members of the tobacco industry, centre largely on the notion that, if it is legal to sell, it should be legal to advertise. I would like to put this argument to rest here and now. This argument plays on an historical accident as tobacco was introduced to the community on a wide scale many years before its health dangers were understood. It would be extremely difficult now to make illegal a product which is used regularly by a third of the adult population. Tobacco is not sold freely in Australia. It is illegal to sell to children, but all children are exposed to advertising in the same way that adults are. Further, as I have mentioned, the Government has recently banned the sale of chewing tobacco and oral snuff on health grounds. A further problem is that the advertising can undermine other health messages. Tobacco advertising is generally glossy, appealing and reinforces the behaviour as adult and/or exciting. It is interesting to note that a survey reported in 1983 in the United Kingdom showed that 44 per cent of smokers agreed-and I quote:
       </para>
       <para>
        Smoking can't be really dangerous or the Government would ban advertising.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are already other products which are legally available in Australia for direct sale to the public which cannot be advertised to the general public. These are mainly therapeutic goods and drugs, and include analgesics and motion sickness tablets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another popular argument put forward by those opposing a ban on tobacco advertising is that such a ban should be opposed because it is an imposition on freedom of speech. I cannot accept this argument. Tobacco advertising is misleading in that it does not properly inform the consumer of the toxic substances contained in its product. Most consumers of tobacco are regular users before they reach an age when society considers they are sufficiently mature to make decisions as adults. The need to ban tobacco advertising in the print media is based on the inescapable and indisputable fact that tobacco is the major preventable cause of death and disease in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that there may be some confusion within the industry about just what is the Government's intention in imposing a ban. I would like to stress that the Government's intention is to prohibit the advertising of tobacco products in the print media. It is not the Government's intention inadvertently to prevent companies from publishing, for example, product recall notices, should they be required to, provided that the product recall notice was simply that and not an advertisement for a tobacco product dressed up as a product recall notice. Nor is it the Government's intention to prevent companies producing such material as, for example, stationery, business correspondence and business cards, provided that these materials do not constitute advertisements. Nor should the Act interfere with the publication of company annual reports, providing that these do not contain tobacco advertisements and are not used as advertisements to promote smoking or the use of tobacco products. Posters advertising tobacco products at point of sale will not be prohibited by this legislation as we regard this properly as a State matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill is not intended to stifle public debate about the right to smoke. It is, therefore, not intended to prohibit the advocacy of the right to smoke as long as this does not promote smoking or the use of tobacco products, and is not associated with the use of a particular product or brand. In addition, the Bill provides a specific exclusion to enable tobacco advertising in trade publications for those involved in trading tobacco or tobacco products.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have already pointed out there is no safe level or form of tobacco use. In 1987, there were some 18,000 tobacco related deaths in Australia. This was 71 per cent of all drug related deaths in Australia. There is strong evidence to show that there is a direct causal relationship between tobacco smoking and a range of illnesses. It was my intention to indicate those relationships. I will simply mention that the relationships appear to be strong in relation to lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart disease, vascular disease and links with a wide range of cancers.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1987 an Australian study on the costs of smoking to the Australian economy conservatively estimated that the total economic cost of smoking related illness in Australia is in excess of $2.5 billion per annum. Clearly, one of the ways of reducing consumer demand for tobacco is to limit advertising. Health authorities acknowledge that tobacco advertising and promotion is not the only determinant in the decision to start or continue smoking, but it is of particular concern because it can affect and reinforce other influences such as peer and social pressures to smoke.
       </para>
       <para>
        Advertisements alter the way cigarettes are perceived. They promote the image of cigarettes as symbols of wealth, glamour, success and healthy good looks, rather than as a harmful addictive drug. The Government believes that there is sufficient evidence to justify our action in this matter and that this evidence has strengthened since the ban on television and radio advertisements was introduced in 1976. A major research study of children in New South Wales, reported in the international Journal of Epidemiology in 1983, found that children who approved of cigarette advertising were twice as likely to smoke as those who disapproved. This report went on to recommend that tobacco advertising be banned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Evidence of the link between advertising and tobacco consumption is also obvious in those countries which have already banned tobacco advertising. For example, in Norway a total ban on cigarette advertising has been in effect since 1975. Detailed research has shown substantial falls in smoking amongst adolescents since the ban was introduced. This positive trend was ascribed to legislation removing advertising which had created pressure on young people to smoke, to the special attention paid to smoking by girls, and to the change in general attitudes towards smoking and smoking behaviour among adults and young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, tobacco advertising is not only being used as a method of affecting the market share of brands, but also is enticing people to start smoking. Most smokers begin smoking before they reach their mid teens. A 1980 survey of school children in Perth found that over 80 per cent of children considered that cigarette advertisements probably encourage children to take up smoking. The study also showed that there was a positive association between linking a particular advertisement to the use of a particular brand of cigarettes. A 1980 survey of secondary school children in Sydney found a similar correlation between the most heavily advertised brands and the use of these brands. Cigarette advertisements portray smoking as a normal, funfilled activity of healthy people. This is not true, and the presentation of these images undermines the messages from health campaigns that smoking causes disease and death. The evidence speaks for itself. The time has come in Australia to end tobacco advertising in the print media on strong public health grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The passage of this legislation is one of the highlights of my term as Health Minister. It is among the most important public health initiatives taken by this Government, and will as such receive widespread popular support in the community. By supporting the trend away from smoking it will contribute very significantly to reducing illness and mortality amongst Australians. The Bill deserves the support of all members of this House. I commend it to the House and I submit the explanatory memorandum.

         —The Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989 started out as a private member's Bill brought before the Parliament by Senator Powell. While it is not an unusual occurrence for legislation to be introduced by a private member, it is unusual for such Bills to succeed. As my colleague Senator Alston pointed out when this matter was before the Senate, since Federation only 12 private member's Bills have successfully passed through all stages in both Houses of the Federal Parliament.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Therefore, what we are dealing with here is a piece of legislation which is somewhat out of the ordinary by virtue of having started out as a private member's Bill. As a consequence we believe very strongly that it is a Bill which the Parliament should have been able to carefully and fully scrutinise. Unfortunately, this has not been allowed and it is a matter of concern to the Liberal and National Parties that there has been insufficient time for a wide range of important economic, social and civil liberties issues to be examined and carefully considered in the context of this debate. This afternoon's guillotining by the Government proves this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition does not take matters of public health and the public interest lightly. We have formed a committee of coalition Senators and Members, chaired by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Michael Wooldridge), to consider all aspects of cigarette smoking. In particular, the committee was given a brief to examine the most efficient and effective ways of discouraging the practice of cigarette smoking. It had been our intention that this committee would carefully examine the issues raised by this Bill and report back to the joint parties so that debate could be conducted on an informed and considered basis. It is, therefore, a matter of continuing and considerable regret that the committee was not able to fulfil its brief before the Senate debate on the Bill on 7 December, and indeed before this debate this afternoon. At the time of the Senate debate, Senator Alston, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, placed on record some of our views and concerns and I as the shadow Minister for health wish to do the same thing in this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition already has a commendable track record of acting in the interests of public health on the smoking issue. As has been pointed out, it was a coalition government which, in 1976, was responsible for the partial ban on the advertising of tobacco products by virtue of section 100 of the Broadcasting Act 1942. In the time which has elapsed between 1976 and 1989 it has become increasingly obvious that there is widespread community support for this limitation on the traditional freedom to advertise legal products.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite our record of concern and action on the smoking issue, however, there are matters contained within this Bill which are unacceptable to some members of the Opposition. In particular, I refer to advertising in non-print areas such as in cinemas, and on billboards, posters, and perimeter signs at sporting events-matters covered by the Bill when originally introduced. It is our firm belief that such matters are clearly within the constitutional province of the governments of the States and Territories and it is our view that they should continue to have the right to exercise their powers in these areas.

        Within our ranks, and I certainly acknowledge within the Government's ranks as well, there has been a body of concern that before legislating for a total prohibition on all forms of tobacco advertising powerful evidence should be available to support the argument that such advertising is a significant contributing factor in a person's decision to take up, or to continue, smoking. The Government's decision to support the contention that non-print advertising should remain a matter for the State and Territory legislatures, rather than the Federal one, has been welcomed by us, and we therefore support the Government's amendments to the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        While regretting the speed with which this Bill is being pushed through the Parliament, it is obvious to us that there is an increasing community acceptance that smoking is an unhealthy and potentially lethal practice which is far less socially acceptable now than it was just a few years ago. To endorse some of the comments made by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), workplace bans on smoking, the prohibition of smoking on domestic aircraft and the segregation of space in many buildings into smoking and non-smoking areas are clear evidence that the tide of community opinion is running against smokers. What is important, though, is that any debate or discussion on this issue should be conducted on the basis of fact and information and not be rooted in emotion and rhetoric. One such fact which is perfectly clear is that there is widespread community knowledge that there is powerful evidence which demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt the health hazards of cigarette smoking. There would be few people above the age of reason who would not be aware of this hazard. Nevertheless, there are those who are undeterred and continue with their smoking habit or take it up either for an experimental period or on a longer term basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hand in hand with the fairly widespread community appreciation of the health implications of smoking, there is also strong community concern that, wherever possible, governments should find and take effective action to discourage smoking, particularly among the young. This concern is the result of clear statistical evidence that cigarette smokers are far more likely than non-smokers to die of lung cancer, heart disease and a range of other respiratory and circulatory diseases. Aside from the cost in human terms, smoking related diseases add significantly to the cost of providing health care services to the community. In view of the fact that it is the community which bears this burden, in both a financial and a social sense, it is understandable that there should be a high level of support for a range of interventionist actions designed to discourage high risk behaviour such as smoking. It does not necessarily follow, though, that prohibiting all cigarette advertising will, by itself, act as a deterrent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister mentioned the example of Norway, Senator Alston also cited this example in his contribution in the Senate. That is a country which has had a total ban on all forms of cigarette advertising since 1975 but which over the last 10 years has had a much smaller decrease in teenage smoking than New South Wales has been able to achieve in just three years. In Australia over the last decade tobacco consumption has dropped by an encouragingly massive 24 per cent. In Norway, on the other hand, the last 10 years have seen a drop in consumption of only some 7 per cent. What these examples reveal is the difficulty in conclusively establishing cause and effect. This is borne out by the January 1989 report of the United States Surgeon-General which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no scientifically rigorous study available to the public that provides a definitive answer to the basic question of whether advertising and promotion increase the level of tobacco consumption.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is for reasons such as this that the Liberal and National parties established our committee to explore all aspects of the issue, like the significance of advertising bans and the achievements of anti-smoking campaigns, especially the Quit campaign in Victoria and various other health promotion foundations in the States and Territories. We recognise, however, that with the passage of this Bill apparently being tied to the Government's election timetable-for we doubt the Parliament will be sitting before an election next year-there is to be no opportunity for such careful consideration of all of these issues and activities. We nevertheless wish to make it perfectly clear that we believe that, unless there are quite exceptional circumstances, a government should not impose restrictions on the advertising of a product which can be legally bought and sold.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a matter which is regarded by some on this side of the House as an issue of great principle even though they are aware that the advertising of other potentially dangerous products, such as guns and dangerous drugs, is severely circumscribed in the public interest. In particular, we see no logical connection between any attempt to ban the advertising of something which, even in small quantities, is hazardous, such as cigarettes, and an attempt or arguments for the imposition of restrictions on bans of advertising for, say, alcohol which, when used in moderation, is quite safe.
       </para>
       <para>
        We earnestly hope that in any future consideration of a proposal which constitutes a fundamental intrusion on traditional freedoms and rights, and which brings to the fore such basic issues as censorship, the Government will ensure that adequate time is allowed for consideration and debate, time which has not been available on this occasion simply because there is an election looming on the horizon.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summing up, I reiterate that the Liberal and National parties regret that the Parliament has had to deal with this issue in great haste in the dying days of this session. We are, however, pleased that the Government has supported our view that it should not interfere in areas which are traditionally and constitutionally within the jurisdiction of the States and Territories. In view of this, and our awareness of the issues of public health and the public interest, we do not oppose the Bill as amended.

         —I accept the comments of the shadow Minister opposite, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), because many of us in this place regret the way in which this debate is having to be rapidly accelerated. Clearly, though, it is delightful that there is a degree of bipartisanship here. We are pleased with the thrust and direction of this legislation which builds on legislation that has been passed before in this Parliament. Indeed, it is important that this legislation is supported by many groups in the electorate, as outlined by the Minister already.

       <para>
        The suggestion by the shadow spokesman that this debate has been hurried is correct. However, it is not a new issue. I well remember that as an undergraduate back in 1974, when we were doing our year in which we undertook epidemiology, I was involved in a survey of school students. That is the time when I suppose this issue first came to light. It is an issue in which I have been involved for some 15 years in a very active way. I am delighted that slowly we are making progress in this area, although it has not been as quick as we would have liked.

        Smoking, of course, is a pernicious activity, a giant silent killer in our community. Indeed, the evidence is overwhelming now, as it has been for some time, that this activity has many effects on the health of our citizens. The numbers have been stated and the issue has been canvassed very well in the press and elsewhere and, indeed, in the Senate. Governments have tried to legislate about it previously, and they have had difficulty. The Western Australian Government, on coming to power in 1983, took initiatives in this area but unfortunately was unable to secure passage of its legislation through the upper House in the Western Australian Parliament. It is at the present moment endeavouring to pass similar legislation and it is hoped that will be successful.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is an historic accident that smoking is legal and it is unfortunate that something like four million citizens in Australia are addicted to tobacco products. With the great intensity in education programs and the moral force of legislation such as this, it will be interesting to see in the next 20 years how many people are recruited into the ranks of smokers. I anticipate that there will be a significant fall-off in the number of people smoking and that it will continue for many years. That will be a result of this legislation and the moral force of initiatives in education and treatment that are so important in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Parliament's role, of course, is to inform people, to discourage those who consider taking up this activity and to ban the promotion of unhealthy products. It is absurd to suggest that advertisements do not recruit new smokers. It is completely inconsistent to suggest that only people who are already smokers see advertisements or are affected by advertisements. It is absurd to suggest that advertising does not work. People who say that are suggesting that large companies which are very well versed in the area of marketing are spending large amounts of money on advertising tobacco products for no effect. That suggestion can be thrown aside. This legislation represents another important step--

         —It represents another important step along the road to changing the behaviour of our citizens. I know the views of the honourable member for Prospect but I do not necessarily have to agree with them. One has only to look at the regulation which brought about the banning of smoking on aircraft, a change which was initiated by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the Caucus. Unfortunately I was not there to second the motion on that day but it was a very significant change and we have found undeniable public support for that move. The honourable member behind me does not like to fly on aeroplanes, so he has not appreciated the change, but clearly it is important and is accepted. As we implement the placing of another brick in the wall, time after time we are seeing a change in community attitudes, which this legislation will promote. In this place we are acutely aware of the arguments about liberty and freedom of speech but in our society there is no freedom to advertise. It is not possible for me to run advertisements in newspapers all over the country unless I have very large amounts of money, and there is certainly no right or freedom to promote unhealthy products. This legislation is important and I know that it will receive the support of very many members on the other side of the House.

         —I find myself for once in agreement with the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), who is at the table-and that is an historical moment, I must say. In his last few days as Minister it is pleasant to be able at last to share something! In the debate in the community and in the Senate a number of issues have been raised in relation to this matter, and I will go through some of these questions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The first question is whether smoking is in fact harmful. Without wanting to sound boastful and conceited, I am probably better qualified to comment on that than anybody else in this House by virtue of having been a cancer specialist prior to coming into this House. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming. I saw countless hundreds-indeed, thousands-of people of all ages, but particularly the young, dying of cancers they should not have died of. If one smokes one packet of cigarettes one's chances of getting cancer of the lung are about eight times normal; if one smokes two packets one is about 25 times more likely to get lung cancer. Smokers have a higher incidence of vascular disease, coronary artery disease, bronchitis and a number of other cancers. There are even rumours-which I hasten to point out are not substantiated-that the level of impotence is higher in smokers. I hope that is not true. The evidence that smoking is harmful is now overwhelming. Anybody who denies it is either crazy or is lying, and it is as simple and as blunt as that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next question is whether advertising increases consumption of tobacco. The tobacco companies would have us believe that all it does is to make individuals change brands but, if we look at their own propaganda over the last few weeks we see they have been telling the newsagents and tobacconists who sell their cigarettes that they have to oppose the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill because otherwise the consumption of cigarettes will go down. A number of other pieces of evidence confirm that increasing consumption is a direct result of advertising.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another question is whether particular age groups have been targeted by the tobacco companies. Quite clearly they have been, and they are those at the wrong end-the youth and, in particular, the females in our society. The targets are those people who attend sports events and cinemas and read magazines-especially those aimed at the younger end of the market and, as the Minister pointed out, particularly female magazines. All of them seek to create the aura of a healthy, happy, bronzed male and a radiantly beautiful, sophisticated female image. I have no doubts at all that there are targeted groups within the tobacco companies' advertising portfolios. We do not, for example, see pictures of little old grannies sitting on verandahs puffing away on their weeds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next question I address is whether smoking is increasing in particular age groups. The Minister for Community Services and Health has already pointed out that undoubtedly it is increasing, particularly in the young, and especially young females. As the Minister pointed out, the 20- to 24-year-old female age group is now the highest smoking group in our community. It seems that the correlation between the groups which are the heavier smokers and the groups which are targeted by the companies is further evidence of the results of tobacco advertising. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a cause and effect. Sure, people will say that there is peer pressure. Peer pressure is important when one decides whether to smoke or not. But, equally, peer pressure is in large part determined by the images portrayed on the cinema screen and in glossy advertising media of different sorts. I have no doubt that this association has been clearly proven.
       </para>
       <para>
        The argument addressed by other speakers as to whether any legally available products should be advertisable is, to my mind, nonsense-for example, advertisements promoting the sale of condoms which, until recently, were not allowed to be shown. I believe that, especially when the product advertised is not only harmful to individuals-as smoking clearly is-but also costs the nation billions of dollars each year, the right to advertise a harmful product does not and should not exist. I do not think that anybody has that right.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently the tobacco companies have raised the spectre of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, indicating that this Covenant allows for information to be disseminated freely to all individuals. However, I point out that certain clauses in this Covenant restrict its effect on tobacco advertising. First of all, the suggestion that information put out in advertisements is not information, by any stretch of the imagination, is pure propaganda. Secondly, there are exceptions to the Covenant by virtue of the damage to public health being done in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this situation, the Government, for once, should be congratulated on picking up this amendment. It is very important that this Parliament gives a lead to our communities, and I hope that it will lead to less smoking, better health for thousands of individuals, a large saving for our economy, which needs every saving it can possibly get at this stage, and a reduction in the incidence of what is, as has been pointed out, the single most preventable cause of disease in our society.

         —I congratulate Janet Powell, a Democrat senator for Victoria, on her initiative. It was something the Government was doing; however, this private member's Bill-the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill-that she has put up and in which she has generated interest is excellent. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has introduced the legislation, which is one of the great moves of this Government. The legislation is important and will have a very long and lasting effect. We will not feel the effect, but I assure the House that 20 to 30 years on our children will appreciate this day. I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your initiative some years ago in Caucus to bring in the regulation relating to no smoking on aeroplanes.

        In September last year in Paris, a well-dressed young Frenchman lit up a Gaullois cigarette in the back of a taxi. Irritated by the smoke, the taxi driver stopped the cab, twisted around and demanded the passenger butt out the cigarette. The smoker refused and the driver knifed his passenger to death. I do not think that that would happen in Australia, but it shows the strength of feeling about not only smoking but also passive smoking-other people smoking in your area. I can remember smoke-filled rooms when I was a kid. Every meeting one went to the room was covered in smoke. Everywhere one went-even football matches-one got covered with smoke. All that has changed, which is good. We have a bipartisan position on the Mornington Peninsula. Graeme Weideman, the State Liberal member for Frankston South, and I have had discussions. We want the Mornington Peninsula to become the first area free from tobacco product advertising. We want it to become a tobacco advertising free zone. There is not too much advertising on the peninsula, but if we can do this and gradually spread the message around Australia, it would be a good start. I believe that we can ban all the billboards that are going up and stop this sort of advertising. I have also heard that Barcelona, which is the venue for the next Olympic Games, will host the first Olympic Games not to have any sponsorship from tobacco companies. That is another good move.

        In the few minutes I have remaining, I would like to concentrate on what is happening in Victoria. In Victoria, 6,200 people die every year from tobacco related diseases. That is a huge number of people. About 120 people die every week from tobacco related diseases. Australia wide 60 people die every day from tobacco related diseases. There are about 60 people in the House at the moment. That number of people would have died today from a disease related to tobacco. That brings home the point that the tobacco companies are doing the wrong thing, and it is about time that changed. Cricket fans are bombarded by more than 40,000 smoking messages during an average cricket test. At an Ashes test match or at an Australia-West Indies test match, 60,000 messages stream out over five days. Just about every time a batsman hits a ball to the boundary, a message from advertising hoardings is flashed into the subconscious. Rhonda Galbally from the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation says that for every 1,000 runs in a major test match cigarettes outscore the batsmen 60 to 1. For every player, 2,500 smoking messages go out to supporters. Each player in his career sends out perhaps a million cigarette messages.

         —I am opposed, as are a number of honourable members, to the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill. The legislation is not about health; it is about restricting the rights of individuals. It is about ensuring that the Government gets the support of the Australian Democrats on a deal which has produced inadequate legislation, which does not address the health issue but desires to restrict advertising in the print media, with doubtful constitutional validity, and leaves a number of gaps which I find totally inexplicable. As I have only a couple of minutes in which to speak I want to identify these gaps rather than go to some of the other things that I think should be said. Proposed section 6 of the Bill, for example, excludes something like 1,400 magazines from overseas that are distributed to Australia. The whole nature of the ban reeks of hypocrisy. The Bill is not about people's health; it is about the Government trying to gain the support of the Democrats and introducing legislation in haste.

        The Australian Medical Association (AMA), in its policy booklet, adopts what I think is the right approach. If we want to stop people smoking, we should try to change the attitudes of society to drug use through educating and influencing the young. The AMA says that that would be much more effective in controlling the growing problem of drug misuse in the long term than law enforcement. There are many ways of preventing and discouraging people-peer pressure is far more influential in encouraging people-to smoke than by introducing a ban on print advertising. This legislation was not introduced by the Government; it came from the wings. Nobody regarded it as being particularly serious until the Government suddenly thought it might be politically expedient.

        The whole question of advertising and its impact on smoking is questionable. In the Senate debate, where there was a little more opportunity than there is here, evidence was produced to show that in those countries where there is already an advertising ban there is less smoking than there is in Australia. A number of honourable members on this side of the House do not believe that this legislation should be allowed to pass.

       This year has been a long one, some would say too long by the look on the faces I see around me these days. It has certainly been a hectic one for all associated with this Parliament. There have been some notable achievements, perhaps none more so in a personal sense for me, if I may say so, than the agreement achieved with the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Marshall Perron, over Aboriginal living areas in the Northern Territory. This problem, I believe, has been a stain on the character of Australian governments, both Territory and Commonwealth, coalition and Labor, for too long. I feel a great sense of achievement regarding these changes and a desire to see that the programs to deliver services to these disadvantaged groups remain in place.
      </para>
      <para>
       There have been important changes, too, involving the Parliament. The House of Representatives had a change of Speaker. As you will understand, Mr Speaker, it is no reflection on you or on the outstanding job I believe you are doing to say that we remember Joan Child and her work with great affection.

        —Joan will leave the Parliament at the end of this term and, to borrow the phrase of more than one Opposition interjector, `We'll all miss you, Joan'. There are other members of this Parliament who will be retiring and for whom this is the last parliamentary Christmas. Clarrie Millar, one of the gentlest, most responsible and respected persons in this place, will see out his seventh Parliament and then retire. This House will be the less for the absence of men of the character of Clarrie Millar. Of course, if one is going to retire, I guess one could do a lot worse than retire to Wide Bay.

       Lionel Bowen will also celebrate his last parliamentary Christmas this year. As I think every honourable member will agree, that, too, will be a great loss to this House. Lionel represents the honour and integrity for which this place should be better known. Common sense and wry good humour are in short enough supply here at the best of times and, unfortunately, there will be less of both. Tom Uren, father of the House, is one of the most genuine, honest blokes one could meet. I do not know whether Tom will thank me for saying that in some ways he has been the conscience of this House. I hope we can keep our conscience after his departure.

       These remarks would not be complete if I failed to mention those who support this Parliament so ably in professional capacities. The Clerk, Deputy Clerk, Clerk Assistants, Serjeant-at-Arms and other parliamentary officers have again performed admirably in, at times, difficult and trying circumstances. The Principal Parliamentary Reporter and the Hansard staff have had an exceptionally difficult year with staff turnover and with the mangling of the English language which occurs in this place. I believe that they deserve the House's highest tribute and I extend it to them.

       The Joint House Department looks after the effective functioning of this building and its services. The attendants do a remarkable job day in and day out, and the transport office has had its share and more of difficult tasks, not made easier by a certain industrial campaign. Those associated with the development and passage of legislation through this House also deserve recognition-the Whips and their staff, Barbara Belcher, our Parliamentary Liaision Officer, and the Parliamentary Counsel's office. Our thanks go to the Telecom Australia operators, who handle and redirect thousands of calls throughout the year, and the Telecom maintenance staff who have a huge job in maintaining services within this building, including my phone, regularly.

       Finally, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and his counterpart, the more than usually honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), both maintain high professional standards in their respective roles, yet both of them manage to retain a sense of humour and a genuine respect. That is a respect that I share, and I extend my thanks and best wishes to them both. Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to wish all the members of this House and the staff a merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year.

On behalf of the Opposition I wish all members of the Parliament a restful break. It is a sad day to be speaking to this motion in the Parliament when Australia has suffered, in terms of carnage on the road, the worst tragedy in our history. It is a tragedy that has shocked the nation and dealt a cruel blow to countless families; it has been made worse, if that is at all possible, by its occurrence on the eve of Christmas. Our hearts go out to all who have lost loved ones so suddenly and tragically. All of us with families can only imagine the sense of grief and abject loss that so many must be feeling today. It is with a heavy heart that one says farewell to 1989 with that occurring in about the last 12 hours.

       I have no idea whether the Parliament will return before the elections. I am damn sure the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will give me no indication-so I can plan with any certainty-whether we will be here in February. Either way, I wish him well in 1990 as he invests his superannuation and congratulates the new leader of the Opposition after he ponders over that problem.

       Mr Speaker, we have had our differences since you were elected but you occupy a seat which is a fundamental institution within an institution and we thank you, despite our differences over your interpretation of the standing orders, and wish you well through the festive season. Our thanks go to the Clerk, the Deputy Clerk, the Serjeant-at-Arms and other parliamentary officers; the Principal Parliamentary Reporter and the Hansard staff; the Parliamentary Librarian and staff; the Secretary and staff of the Joint House Department and those tireless people who serve them. In mentioning the term `tireless', our thanks go to John May, Brian Flanagan and Paul Felsman for the difficult task throughout the year of organising the transport of members of the Parliament.

       The Prime Minister warmly mentioned my colleague, the Deputy Leader in the House of Representatives, Mr Wal Fife, who is also Manager of Opposition Business. He has been a tower of strength to me and has been ably served by deputies under him-both Wilson Tuckey and Tim Fischer. I wish Kim Beazley well. I know he is, for the first time in his life, doorknocking his electorate and I trust he will take a break from that over the Christmas period. We thank him for his cooperation. There is undoubtedly a great reservoir of trust between the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the House, and that is absolutely essential.

       To the Whips who serve this side of the Parliament, Ewen Cameron, Neil Andrew, Mike MacKellar and David Hawker, go my thanks. I thank my own staff who, this year, have worked extraordinarily hard. I hope the press gallery and others have an enjoyable break. I say without any frivolity that the Prime Minister carries a great burden of office for this country and I would never criticise him for taking a break and a rest. It is certainly a well deserved one. I hope it will refresh him and that he and his family have a most enjoyable Christmas Day. To all the members of the House, I look forward to my day with my children, and I hope you will have as joyous a one as I am looking forward to.

       We all awoke the other day to learn of the action by the United States of America (USA) in Panama against Noriega and I am sure that we all support US intentions in that area. While many of us were hopeful that this Christmas would bring to eastern Europe the benefits that we in this country have taken for granted for so long-that is, the freedom and right to liberty that is part and parcel of democracy-I am sure we were all horrified at the actions that have occurred in recent days in Romania. Let us be absolutely clear that that has got nothing to do with ideology or propping up particular thoughts. That is simply the actions of a desperate regime clinging to power for its own personal benefit no matter what the human cost. One is absolutely horrified that members of any government, regime or group could inflict such damage and suffering on their people for their own personal gain.

       As my friend and colleague, the Leader of the Opposition has said, the news that greeted us this morning about the horrific accident on the Pacific Highway in New South Wales brings sadness to all our hearts. To have that sort of tragedy inflicted upon those families at this time of the year, when many of those passengers would have been travelling between Sydney, Brisbane and other places to join with their families and friends to celebrate a Christmas together, makes the impact even worse. I am sure we all join with them and convey our sincere sympathy and understanding for their loss at this otherwise very happy time of the year.

       Mr Speaker, I thank you and your predecessor, Mrs Child, for your work in this place during the year. I thank all your deputies who have worked so ably when you have been unable to be in the Chair; the Clerks, without whose guidance this place would not operate as efficiently as it does; the Serjeant-at-Arms, who is not with us today, and her deputy, who performed their tasks so diligently and competently during the year and, of course, Barbara Belcher whose good offices ensure that we all know what is happening in this place from time to time-she does a magnificent job. To the Hansard reporters who labour under great difficulties and who this year have encountered difficulties in finding the appropriate number of people to cover the proceedings of this House all the time, we say thank you for recording our words.

       To the Parliamentary Library, which provides support to all members and, in particular, is of great assistance to members on this side of the House; to John May and his team who provide the House of Representatives transport and whose job, as the Prime Minister correctly observed, has been made far more difficult in the past few months because of a dispute-I am not quite sure whether it exists at present, but it has certainly disrupted everybody's travel; to those people who work in just about every facet of this enormous building, from the chefs and the staff in the dining room through to the attendants, the security staff, the cleaners and the switchboard operators; to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation staff who are holding up a `Merry Christmas' sign-thank you, because I think you do a superb job; and to members of the press gallery who, I think, have departed on a well-earned Christmas break, we wish you a happy Christmas. I wish my colleague, Andrew Peacock, and his team a happy Christmas on behalf of all the members of the National Party. I am sure he will enjoy it and spend a very restful and recuperative time with his family. I wish my National Party colleagues a safe journey home to their families and their communities. I thank Bruce Lloyd for his support during the year and Noel Hicks-the most efficient Whip in the Parliament-who does a superb job without incurring the wrath or displeasure of his colleagues, and, of course, his able assistant Garry Nehl. I also thank Michael MacKellar and David Hawker for the work that they do. I thank Paul Davey, who runs our secretariat, and his team for their support. Last, but not least, I thank my personal staff for the assistance that they have provided to me in the past six months. I wish all members of this House on both sides and honourable senators in the other place a happy and holy Christmas and a prosperous and healthy 1990.

        —I wish to add my remarks to those that have already been made and give thanks particularly to those who are responsible for running this House and keeping us all going. This is the first full year of operation, of course, in the new place. It still has many teething problems and they have done extraordinarily well to keep us all batting along. It has been a signal year in many ways for many of the people who serve us so well. I would like to give particular thanks to the Clerks of the House. For them this is the year in which they launched yet another excellent reference manual on the House of Representatives practice. The Clerk had a great deal to do with its preparation, as he did with its predecessor, and can be justly proud of the result. It is a reference work not only for us but for many other parliaments as well.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I would like also to join in thanking those who are responsible for preparing materials to come before us-The Bills and Papers Office and the Table Office. If we look at the way Parliament has to run in these two-day sittings, when we are batting legislation from the House of Representatives to the Senate and back again, we become thoroughly aware of the capacity of the people in these organisations, as well as the reporting staff, who scamper about getting things together at very short notice. The geography of this place makes everything slightly more impossible than it was in the previous House and therefore we ought to be very grateful to them. The parliamentary attendants have had slightly more work to do in this place than the very considerable load they carried over in the other place, not least intercepting the odd fellow who takes it in mind to jump off the top rungs around us. Since the last person who came over was after me I am very glad that they are diligent in the way in which they perform their protective functions for all of us.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to give particular personal thanks to Barbara Belcher and her staff. Everybody knows who is the real leader of the House in this place and therefore they all have conversations with Barbara rather than with me. That makes for far more pleasant conversation for those who choose to do it. In this particular instance not only is it more pleasurable but it is usually more effective. Both sides of the House rely enormously on her and there is real value in the way in which people such as Barbara Belcher have been selected-they are almost non-partisan in the parliamentary context in the way in which they do business. I particularly thank our Whips on this side of the house who do an extremely good job. It is a little bit harder to be a Government Whip than any other Whip. Not only do they have more people to look after than is the case with the Opposition Whips, but there are various standing order requirements which on occasion require a No. 75, for example, which is extraordinarily difficult to keep up. Both the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) and the honourable member for Streeton (Mr Lamb) maintain a very high level of unpopularity in Caucus but a very high level of popularity with the Leader of the House.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are a number of other people who serve us very well but have not yet been mentioned, and I will very quickly go through them. They are the catering staff, cleaning staff, gardeners, tour guides, post office staff, those who work at Westpac Banking Corporation, Qantas Airways Ltd, Aussie's Capital Hill General Store in particular, Mary in the gym and all the rest of the team, the staff of the parliamentary committees, the secretaries of our parties and the drivers, of course, who serves us so well to and from this place. For all these categories of people, I think the full year of operation in this new establishment has been a testing time and they have handled their affairs in this place very well. I also thank the Opposition spokesmen who do business with us on the day to day ordering of the parliamentary agenda. Very reasonable and well-founded words of praise have been offered from both sides of the House to my counterpart on the other side, Wal Fife. I simply join them; I can do no better than what has been stated both by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) in that regard.

Mr Speaker, your elevation has been most justified and your illustrious career is enhanced by the fact that your immediate predecessor was Joan Child who did a fine job in her years as Speaker of this place. Of course, Mr Speaker, you have been well served by your Deputy Speaker from my home State and the others who act as Deputy Chairman of Committees. On the whole, from the point of view of the functioning of Parliament, this has been a very good year indeed. I join with the others who have wished all members and all those who have served us so well a happy Christmas.

        —Over the years some people have reached this part of the year in this House, and in another chamber in which I sat for many years, with a sense of cynicism. I have never reached this stage of the year in any parliament in which I have sat with that feeling. One of the great things about Australia and other democratic countries is that we can have deep-seated differences of opinion on political matters and we can engage in the cut and thrust of debate but, above it all, we can have a healthy respect and regard for each other. I believe that what has been said here today indicates that.

      <para>
       I am sure that people on both sides of the House can testify, although they do not always like to own up to it, that they have some very good long-time friends on the other side of politics. I make that confession here both in relation to people who serve in this House and to people who served in the New South Wales Parliament when I was a member there. Without repeating the names of all the people who have been mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), my own Leader, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), I would like to endorse what they have said about other people and thank them for some kind words that they uttered about me. I genuinely endorse the remarks about the people who make this Parliament run because all of us, although some of us may be long-serving members of Parliament, rely very heavily on those who provide professional advice to us. Whilst we are engaged in our politicking they are always available to give us that professional advice. Mr Speaker, without mentioning too many names I would just like to refer to you, to your predecessor, to the Clerks and particularly to Barbara Belcher who, as the Leader of the House has said, serves both sides in an apolitical way. I think she has brought a new dimension to that role and I take this opportunity of not only thanking her but also congratulating her.
      </para>
      <para>
       I conclude by saying to the Leader of the House that it has been a pleasure to work with him during the year. We have agreed on most things. We have disagreed occasionally, but on no occasion did he give me a wrong steer and I hope he feels the same about me. I thank him for his cooperation and I take the opportunity now of wishing every person present and, indeed, all honourable members' families a very happy Christmas.

        —I would certainly like to endorse what has been said by previous speakers in thanking those who have served the Parliament, both elected members and non-elected people, and also to wish everybody a happy Christmas. I do not want the occasion to pass without noting that this is the last meeting of the House of Representatives in this decade and it may well be the last meeting before there is a change of government. I thought it was worth while asking members to reflect on the performance of this House as a whole. We should ask ourselves some questions about what we think of the House and of our own performance. Is this House a good democratic forum? Is it a place of genuinely reasoned argument? Is it a civilised place where we feel happy about being here all the time? Is it a place where people have an underlying respect for each other and for each other's arguments? Do members as a whole take pride in this chamber and in the way it works?
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       We have only to ask those questions to raise some very serious doubts about the way in which we conduct our business. I am not saying this in a partisan way, because I think parties on both sides of the House have not served this House well in the way they have allowed it to move in a direction which is not helpful to civilised and reasoned debate. At a time of extraordinary historic change, when democracy is being extended to almost all the continents of the globe-it is something which we have treasured here for a very long time-we have to ask ourselves very seriously how we are using it.
      </para>
      <para>
       If there is a change of government we on this side of the House, on moving over to the other side, should tell ourselves that we will try to run it a lot better. I do not say that we ran it very well when we were there. When I came here from a different kind of career, I asked very serious questions about the way the House was run. I was told by some of the old hands, `When you are here for a few years you will see the value of a whole lot of the things that we do'. Mr Speaker, I can honestly say to you that 12 years after coming here I still do not believe that this House is run in the way that it should be. It is not run in as civilised a way as it could be. This is not your fault or that of your predecessors. I think the Government really sets the style for the way the House is run. I will just give one example. At midnight last night I was in here at the table as the duty shadow Minister. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) was here in his capacity as the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Between midnight and about 12.25 a.m. he introduced seven very important reports of the Public Accounts Committee which had entailed hundreds of hours of work behind the scenes. We hardly ever see the results of that kind of work in this chamber.
      </para>
      <para>
       I suppose that I am really speaking on behalf of the less showy members of this House who work very hard in a bipartisan way for at least 90 per cent of the time to get a job done. It is really dreadful if the results of their work are brought in here at midnight, and the Chairman of the Committee, who has directed what is going on, has 25 minutes to speak about seven very important reports. If we go back to yesterday's business sheet to see what was contained in it and if we look at the Hansard, we see that they go to the heart of very important issues of government.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have to organise ourselves better so that more time is devoted to those kinds of things and less time to the kind of circus which occupied most of our time yesterday-apart from the serious contributions that were made. I believe that that is something which honourable members on both sides of the House should dedicate themselves to doing. It is also important to change Question Time, and it is up to the Government to do that. The Standing Orders do not govern Question Time. Even if we changed the Standing Orders we could still have problems. It should be possible to have 40 questions answered in 45 minutes and that would enable honourable members on both sides of the House to ask genuine questions of great concern to the people of Australia and to their constituents. It is possible to do that in the House of Commons in Canada, but the Government has to set the style. I am suggesting that, when this House next meets, whoever is running the government can set that style and make that three-quarters of an hour every afternoon a meaningful, useful experience for all of us. Also, those sitting in the gallery would then have much greater respect for all of us.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am sorry to conclude on that note, but it is sometimes important to have a close look at ourselves. There are very few occasions on which we can. I think we can do an enormous amount better, but we all have to behave in the much more civilised way in which we behave in committees-in the civilised way in which we behaved in our own private professions before we came here-when we are running ministerial offices, or carrying out those important tasks which are entrusted to us. It is only when we come into this chamber that some sort of bug seems to bite and people start to behave in a way in which they were prevented from behaving in primary school.

I particularly thank my friend the President of the Senate for his cooperation in the administration of the three joint departments. I thank my Deputy, Mr Ron Edwards, Margaret Fisher in his office, and the deputy chairmen of committees, who work with them, for the assistance that they have provided in the running of the chamber. I would particularly and most sincerely like to thank Joan Child, first, for the opportunity she gave me in allowing me to hold this high office. It is an important matter to reflect on and it arises out of what the honourable member for MacKellar (Mr Carlton) just said. There are not many people who are as generous as Joan Child in being willing to give her deputy a chance to hold this very high office. She will go down in our memory as a person who has done that.

        I would also like to recognise the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) and all the factional hacks, seeing that he was so keen to get his words into the Hansard and seeing that I, of course, have moved out of those ranks now. I would like to thank the Clerks, the Sergeant-at-Arms and all the officers of the parliamentary departments for the crucial contribution that they have made. I think Barbara Belcher and her staff will put in for a salary rise after all the things that have been said about her. But there is no doubt that Barbara's pleasant smile and pleasant staff certainly make this place work a lot better.

        The Whips, their deputies and staffs have played a crucial role in keeping the numbers together on both sides. The way the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) have been able to work together has made the House work so much more smoothly. In those two gentlemen we actually have a good example of the way people can cooperate to make this place work. The Joint House Department has had a difficult year in moving into the new building and we should all thank everyone in the Joint House Department, particularly the catering people and particularly the gardeners because it is their work that will turn this place into a most attractive building.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, who turn our speeches, which probably do not really shine, into diamonds. I thank the Librarian and his staff and particularly Reina Hill, who keeps us supplied with books to improve our minds and relax with. I thank the members of the press gallery, who sometimes report what we say, but when one thinks of the number of personal explanations we get, one sees that they obviously get it wrong on frequent occasions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank the tour guides who, honourable members might not be aware, have shown over 2.6 million people through this building since it opened. That is an incredible number of people. That shows that this building has been accepted by all Australians as a great national institution. It is also interesting to note that there have not been too many people complain about the price. For a number of years the building of this new Parliament House was put off by governments which worried about the outcry relating to the cost, but the 2.6m people who have been through here since this building was opened have seen that they have got value for their money-at least in the building!

       <para>
        I thank the technicians who run the switchboard, the printers, the security staff and particularly John May and his staff. I thank my department, the clerks and the people in the committee office, who work so long and so hard to produce such excellent reports. They have all been tremendous. Their dedication and long hours are appreciated by all of us. We wish them a well deserved, restful and happy break. I thank my own staff, particularly Ann Stewart, my Senior Private Secretary, and the rest of my staff, and Margaret Fisher in the Deputy Speaker's office for the support that they have given.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the questions raised by the honourable member for Mackellar are something that all honourable members should apply themselves to, I think that too infrequently people realise that there is, as the honourable member for Hume said, a great deal of friendship across both sides of this Parliament; that people have a great deal of common interests. Question time is the time when we come in here and prosecute our arguments and fight to see who will have the chance to run the country. But people forget that over 90 per cent of the legislation is passed through here by agreement. People also forget about the work that honourable members do on committees; 95 per cent of the committee reports are unanimous. It is unfortunate that the gallery tends to highlight the divisive parts of the day and the year rather than the times when there is agreement. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation does a very good job with its program called Ring the Bells because it highlights some of the times when we are in agreement rather than the times we are in disagreement.

       The current situation with respect to bilateral and multilateral aid to Vietnam is:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom suspended their direct bilateral aid in 1979 and have not since resumed it. Since 1981, New Zealand, Australia, Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany have provided some humanitarian assistance. Such Australian assistance has largely been channelled through United Nations agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Sweden and Finland have continued direct bilateral programs of assistance to Vietnam since 1979. They are the only two non-socialist countries to have done so. I understand that Denmark is currently considering the resumption of its program of direct bilateral assistance to Vietnam. I also understand that New Zealand is considering resuming aid through multilateral agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Donors have generally continued to provide funding to multilateral agencies with programs in Vietnam.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund have undertaken assessment missions to Vietnam in recent times, but no new loan proposals have yet been approved. The International Monetary Fund has also sent survey missions to Vietnam and informal discussions are underway on a possible line of credit.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) As I have now said on a number of occasions since the disappointing end to the Paris Conference on Cambodia, the resumption of an Australian bilateral aid program in Vietnam cannot be considered in isolation from other elements of our approach to the immensely complicated issue of Cambodia. There has been a withdrawal of Vietnamese formed military units from Cambodia, but in the absence to date of effective verification of that withdrawal, a long-standing Australian precondition for the resumption of aid to Vietnam cannot be judged to have been met. Given the role Vietnam can still play in advancing a comprehensive settlement, a resumption of aid is also contingent on circumstances evolving in which such a settlement of the Cambodia issue is in place, or least in prospect.

       However, in the case of the airline pilots, they caused significant and unprecedented disruption to the airline system and then resigned en masse. Faced with this situation, the Government, through the use of the ADF, helped maintain as best it could the freedom of the public to move about the country.

       (b) Agreement was reached with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on the terms of agreements, then being negotiated between the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments on new funding arrangements for legal aid, requiring account to be taken of the separate funding of Aboriginal Legal Services and agreeing to the provision of legal aid for all eligible persons, including Aboriginals, through the present and proposed Legal Aid Commissions in the States and Territories. Where any change in funding by the Commonwealth of an Aboriginal Legal Service is likely to have a significant impact on the operations of a Legal Aid Commission, that change is to be the subject of consultation between the Commonwealth and the State or Territory Government in the jurisdiction involved. Separate consultations were also held over a possible reduction in the service provided by the Aboriginal Legal Service in Western Australia and the capacity of the Legal Aid Commission in that State to deal with additional cases. As a result of action taken by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the provision of services by the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia was unaffected and the services of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia were apparently maintained.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The export of merino ewes, ova, and embryos from Australia is not, in general, permitted, except to New Zealand. With the approval of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, however, exports of limited specified quantities of ewes, ova, or embryos may be permitted for the purpose of approved joint government-to-government overseas research programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Merino rams are permitted to be sold at designated merino export auctions for export or for use as donors of semen for export, up to a quota limit; the quota in 1989 is 700. There is no restriction on sale of merino rams to New Zealand.
      </para>
      <para>
       The current arrangements have been in place since 1987-88, following Government acceptance of the findings of a wide-ranging review undertaken by the Merino Export Review Committee. That Committee concluded that sales of merino genetic material posed no threat to the Australian wool industry, and recommended that the export of merino rams under quota should continue and the export of merino semen be permitted subject to adequate safeguards. The Committee, however, also recommended that the embargo on the export of merino ewes, ova, and embryos, should be retained.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's decisions on these matters took into account the Committee's arguments that
      </para>
      <para>
       export of merino rams would improve trade relations with wool importing countries, and would have the potential to stimulate the Australian stud industry to the benefit of the Australian wool industry; and
      </para>
      <para>
       there is no difference in effect between the export of merino rams and semen; but
      </para>
      <para>
       the removal of the embargo on merino ewes, ova, and embryos was not warranted at that stage, given the likely limited export demand for these items, reflecting in part the susceptibility of ewes to breeding problems after export, and the strong opposition by both woolgrowers and stud breeders.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Department records the time taken to process migration applications through each processing stage and within each category. Median times, based on the passage of applications through the processing pipeline last program year have been calculated and are attached. Table ``A'' gives the processing or waiting times to final approval in months by post and category. Table ``B'' gives the processing times in months to approved in principle by post and category.
      </para>
      <para>
       The median times provided can only be used as a guide. Large variations in processing times within the same category and at the same post can and do occur.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of the diverse and complex factors affecting processing times are:
      </para>
      <para>
       the make-up of each post's workload across the policy spectrum;
      </para>
      <para>
       the complexity of local operating conditions;
      </para>
      <para>
       the number of each kind of visa issued at each post;
      </para>
      <para>
       the priority accorded to each migration category;
      </para>
      <para>
       exit laws of some countries;
      </para>
      <para>
       the hitherto time-consuming nature of much of the process for recognising overseas occupational qualifications;
      </para>
      <para>
       an increase in the application rate in the Independent and Concessional category over the last few years, compounded by the operation of a fixed passmark;
      </para>
      <para>
       local clearances outside the direct control of posts; and
      </para>
      <para>
       overall limits on the resources that can be provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under current policy, the number of new applications entering the migration processing stream is limited by the points system to ensure that only the highest scoring applicants are accepted for visa issue in the Independent and Concessional category. This is done by linking the pool of the highest scoring applicants to the available places in the Migration Program. Applicants unable to meet the minimum mark for entry to the pool are refused.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additional resources were provided to many posts to help them clear the accumulated backlog of cases. This effort resulted in the pipeline of cases in the Independent and Concessional category being reduced by one third last year.
      </para>
      <para>
       In resource terms, emphasis continues to be given to resolving the remaining backlog of persons whose applications are still in the pipeline. This task must be completed this year. The outcome will be to re-establish the former correlation between resources, annual program and workloads and to achieve global standards of service. Application rates and processing times are monitored on an ongoing basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       Posts without a resident Migration Officer will operate to the same standard of service to ensure that processing times world-wide are reasonable.

       (1) In view of the finding through comprehensive screen tests in New South Wales and Victoria that up to 40 per cent of the 600 deaths from breast cancer in Australia each year could be averted with faster diagnosis, will the Government provide funding for a nationally coordinated screening program.

       (3) Will the Government consider allowing concessions under Medicare for women from country centres who must travel considerable distances to receive mammography tests.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I wish the issues concerning the use of mammography to screen for breast cancer were as straightforward as the question implies. Unfortunately, it is not just a question of dollars and how many lives might be saved, even though these are important factors. Professor Roger Blamey from Nottingham City Hospital recently summed up the situation well when he stated that `only if the screening program and its outcome are run very skilfully do the benefits outweigh the problems'.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Australia, all Health Ministers have accepted the advice of both overseas and local experts in breast cancer screening that we should complete an evaluation of pilot projects which are developing and testing a whole range of matters including identification of target groups, encouraging women to participate in screening, standards of screen taking and screen interpretation, arrangements for call-back and follow-up treatment, training needs, etc. If it is decided to introduce a national screening program, these pilot projects will form the nucleus of centres of excellence on which the program would be based.
      </para>
      <para>
       The evaluation program, which will be completed in June 1990, is being coordinated on behalf of the Australian Health Ministers by a Screening Evaluation Coordination Unit established within the Australian Institute of Health. The results of the evaluation program will be considered by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council in October 1990 and then subsequently by the Health Ministers and their respective governments. At this stage of the evaluation it is clear that the greatest difficulty with mammography relates to the appropriate interpretation of the screen and the minimisation of the percentage of erroneous reports.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am also advised that a mammary serum antigen is being developed in Australia as a possible alternative technology to mammography for breast cancer screening. If such a test became available breast cancer screening might only involve a relatively easy and inexpensive blood test.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Medicare Benefits Schedule is not suitable for covering the provision of mammography and other screening services because it does not cater for the different types of providers involved; there is no facility for targeting of particular age groups; and it is difficult to establish systematic monitoring of program and quality control measures.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another factor is that there is no common fee being charged for screening mammography at the present time. One of the pilot projects based in a public hospital is providing free services whilst another, a private unit, is charging $40. It is known that other units are charging up to $100. The report on the evaluation should provide guidance as to acceptable cost levels.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Pilot projects within the current evaluation program are testing methods of how best to provide mammography services to women in country centres and remote areas. One approach being tested is the use of mobile vans equipped to provide screening mammography services at locations convenient to women in country areas. If a national screening mammography program is established in Australia, appropriate provision would be made for women in country areas to access the screening services.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to diagnostic and treatment services for breast cancer, the Commonwealth Government already provides funds to State and Territory Governments to assist with travel costs incurred by patients from isolated areas in gaining access to specialist services.

       (a) On 1 April 1989, the commencement date for the Namibian transition process, a force of several hundred soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), the military wing of SWAPO, crossed into Namibia from Angola in contravention of the ceasefire agreements reached under United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 (1978). Those ceasefire arrangements provided for the confinement of South African and insurgent forces to bases while arrangements were made for elections and transition to an independent government.

       On 8 and 9 April 1989, a Joint Monitoring Commission consisting of representatives of Angola, Cuba and South Africa, and observers from the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), met at Mt Etjo. The Joint Monitoring Commission agreed on arrangements for the withdrawal of SWAPO soldiers and this process was largely completed by 23 May.

       (4) Inflexible adherence to the two-term principle would not always accord with Australia's overriding interest in the efficient functioning of the UN Specialised Agencies. Its application on a number of occasions would have resulted in the election of an unsuitable candidate and, on others, could have risked endangering the success of an on-going reform process. For this reason the principle has been advocated selectively. Currently no Australian missions are being encouraged to seek amendments to the constitutions of UN Specialised Agencies with an aim to limiting the tenure of the heads of those Agencies.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) to (5) The Government has decided that a general aviation aerodrome is to be built as the first stage of development at the Badgerys Creek site. The planning and design process for the new airport has already commenced. The detailed lay out and capacity of the initial stage of development will be determined as part of the design process. It is anticipated that the general aviation airport will become operational in 1992. The timing of further development of the airport to accommodate larger domestic and international aircraft will depend on traffic demand.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) As at 31 October 1989, the Commonwealth had purchased 204 properties on the Badgerys Creek site leaving only a further 39 properties to be acquired.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) (8) (9) The cost of land acquisition to 31 October 1989 has been $47.472 million. This amount has been paid to landowners for their properties and for associated costs. It is estimated that a further $72.6 million will be necessary to finalise the acquisition process including compensation payments for properties already acquired.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) The acquisition of the remaining 39 properties is proceeding under compulsory acquisition processes. Most of these properties will be acquired before the end of this year. Two owners of four properties have made appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal concerning the Government's decision to purchase their properties. It is likely that these appeal hearings will run into 1990. On that basis, the completion of the acquisitions could be delayed until April 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) (12) (13) The New South Wales Government has offered its co-operation in the development of an implementation plan for the proposed Badgerys Creek Airport. Accordingly negotiations have been initiated with the New South Wales Government in relation to the provision of supporting infrastructure including transportation links.

      <para>
       The Civil Aviation Authority and Federal Airports Corporation have been established during the first two years covered by this question, and relevant records are spread over several offices and financial systems. Therefore, extraction of all details on consultancies in the Aviation function during those two years would necessitate an excessive use of resources. Accordingly, where actual costs for each year have not been available, the amount shown with an asterisk represents the estimated cost at the time of commissioning particular consultancies. The duration of some consultancies is not readily available.

       As the honourable member will be aware, the United Nations consists of numerous organisations, commissions, specialised agencies and institutes. Therefore, the research effort required to extract the requested information for all fifteen members of the South Pacific Forum is considerable and also necessitates legal judgements about the circumstances of those self-governing Forum members which maintain formal associates with former administering states. I would be glad to respond further if the honourable member could be more specific but I am reluctant to allocate scarce Departmental resources to research matters which are accessible from public sources and are without apparant policy implications.

       (3) The South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency Convention (see paragraph 1 (b) above) already provides a framework for fisheries management and conservation in the South Pacific to which the countries of the region are party. Detailed consideration has not been given to the conclusion of an all-embracing fisheries convention to cover the whole Pacific region because there is no comprehensive overlap of species or particular fisheries concerns between the North and South Pacific. On particular issues of joint concern, for example, driftnet fishing, there has been coordinated action in the North and South Pacific.

No financial assistance was provided for publication of the book which, as indicated in my answer to question No. 2028, was undertaken as a commercial venture by Penguin (Australia) Ltd. No financial assistance was provided by the Government in distribution of the book, although the Government was involved in distributing those copies provided to it by Penguin (Australia) Ltd under the terms of the contract between the Government and the Publisher. It is not practical to cost this distribution of the book, details of which are provided in my answer to Question No. 2028.

       (9) All applications will be accepted from PRC nationals. Because of the large numbers involved the Government has yet to determine how best to process the applications. When this decision is taken the applications will be considered. Some applications have been finalised. These are cases where circumstances demanded consideration.

       (10) My Department's instruction number PC 1601 of 4 July 1989 sets out instructions to staff in relation to advising PRC nationals.

      <para>
       (11) My Department's instruction number PC 1601 of 4 July 1989 also instructs staff to grant authority to work, on request, to PRC nationals in Australia on 4 June with expired entry permits. As well, PRC nationals illegally in Australia may lodge applications for refugee status and, as eligible, for permanent residence.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) On 8 December 1989 I reaffirmed that no PRC national temporarily in Australia on 20 June would have to return to the PRC in the immediate future unless they wished to do so. The Government will be making a regulation to permit PRC nationals who were here illegally on 20 June to receive, on application, a special temporary entry permit valid until 31 January 1991. Further, before a deportation order can be raised, the Migration Act requires that a check be made that there is no valid entry permit application before the Department or a review body.

      <para>
       My portfolio has a number of boards, councils and committees within its sphere of responsibility which are of a highly technical nature, In reviewing membership of them every effort is made to identify suitable female candidates. This includes liaison with the Office of the Status of Women, which maintains a database of women with qualifications/experience in a range of technology areas. Even so, it is often the case that the number of women with expertise in a given field required by these bodies is very limited and, therefore, appointments to such bodies are very often limited in their options of possible appointees. Active attention will continue to be given to this important matter.

      <para>
       The Minister for Industrial Relations has the power to appoint some or all of the members of fifty-five boards, councils and committees, fifty of which are established by statutes for which the Minister has administrative responsibility and five of which are non-statutory.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975 the Minister is empowered to appoint fifteen persons to the Australian Council for Union Training. In the case of fourteen of the positions concerned the Minister appoints persons representing certain organisations or Departments specified in the Act. Similarly, with respect to the seven regional councils which are also established under the Act and Regulations, the Minister is empowered to appoint twelve persons to each Council, but in the case of nine of these positions makes the appointments either on the nomination of, or after consultation with, certain persons and organisations specified in the Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946 the Minister is empowered to make appointments to forty trades committees. All the committees except those relating to the blacksmithing trades consist of five members. In the case of four of these positions the Act requires that the persons who are appointed represent employers or employees. The Minister is empowered to appoint three persons to each blacksmithing trades committee but in the case of two of the three positions concerned, the Act requires that the persons appointed represent employers or employees.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977, the Minister is empowered to appoint fourteen of the sixteen members of the National Labour Consultative Council. In the cast of thirteen of the fourteen positions concerned, the Act provides for the appointment of persons nominated by certain specified organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act 1977 the Minister is empowered to appoint the seven members of the Stevedoring Industry finance Committee. In the case of six of the seven positions concerned, the Act provides for the appointment of persons nominated by certain specified organisations. The Minister is also responsible for the appointment of government directors to the boards of five Workplace Resource Centres. Workplace Resource Centres are non-statutory bodies incorporated under the Companies legislation of the States in which they have been established. As the first of these centres was not established until May 1989, part (b) of the question does not apply.

      <para>
       (1) The Australian Federal Police (AFP), being the primary law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth Government, is charged with the responsibility to co-operate and/or maintain contact with Interpol. The National Central Bureau of Interpol in Australia is located within AFP Headquarters and is staffed by AFP employees.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The National Central Bureau is staffed by fifteen AFP employees.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) For the 1988-89 financial year, the cost of maintaining the unit was $570,847. That figure includes the costs of salaries, overtime, penalties and administration expenses.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Australia's financial contribution to Interpol for the 1988-89 financial year was 480,000 Swiss Francs. The exchange rate at the time of payment in February 1989 was AUD1 = CHF1.3495 which converted to $355,683.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) After the Anschluss (the occupation of Austria by Germany) in 1938, Interpol was controlled by the Nazis until the end of the Second World War. It is believed that of the Nazis who were Presidents of Interpol during World War II, at least some of them were senior Gestapo officers.
      </para>

       (6) (a) Florent Louwage was President of Interpol from 1946 to 1956.

       (b) Paul Dickopf was President of Interpol from 1968 to 1972.

      <para>
       (7) (a) Enquiries with the Interpol Secretariat General could not produce a firm answer other than that it was doubtful Mr Louwage would have held his post after the war if the accusation were true. Advice received from the Belgian Commissioner General of Criminal Police is that Mr Florent Louwage ``was by no means a war-time collaborator. He behaved in an exemplary manner during the occupation of our country (Belgium).''
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) I am advised by the Interpol Secretariat General that Mr Dickopf deserted from the German Army during the Second World War and was a refugee in Switzerland at the end of hostilities.

       (8) I am advised that the Interpol General Secretariat does not hold any statistics on this.

       (9) Interpol is not a private organisation. Its members are official police bodies delegated by countries.

       (10) The Constitution and General Regulations of Interpol do not, by their own terms, require ratification.

The Interpol Constitution and General Regulations are not a treaty.

       (11) As noted above, ratification is not required by the terms of the Constitution and General Regulations of Interpol. I am not able to say whether such documents have been submitted for ratification by any other countries. I am not aware of any case in which this has been done.

       (6) The capacity of the Department's detention centres, especially in NSW, has from time to time limited the Department's compliance activities. In response, the Department has increased its efforts towards the early supervised departure of illegal entrants. In addition, the Government introduced legislation allowing sureties to be imposed on illegal entrants in place of their detention. The legislation also allows seizure of assets on account of costs, including detention costs, which might provide illegal and prohibited entrants with incentives to reduce detention costs. It also commissions a report on options for improved compliance responses as they related to detention centres. This report is under consideration.

      <para>
       (1) The Government does not have a special program for unaccompanied Vietnamese minors under the camp clearance arrangements included in the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA). Government policies and procedures, however, permit the entry of individual cases on their merits where a sponsorship has been lodged by a family member who is able to provide appropriate care and support for the minor and where resettlement is in the best interests of the minor. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is establishing procedures in each country of first asylum to assess on an individual basis whether resettlement is in the best interests of unaccompanied minors. The Government endorses the UNHCR principle that the possibility of repatriation to the homeland should always be kept under review, particularly in order to permit family reunification with parents. Australia does not require an organisation to sponsor unaccompanied minors for entry to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I am advised that Canada does not currently have a special program for the resettlement of unaccompanied minors. While Canada's general approach remains that repatriation is the most appropriate solution for unaccompanied minors, there is scope for the entry of individual cases where UNHCR has determined that resettlement is in the best interests of the minor. Unlike Australia which requires a family member to sponsor, Canada has permitted private groups to sponsor the entry of an unaccompanied minor. Government sponsorship may also be available in a limited number of cases where the minors are close to adult age and can speak English or French. I understand that Canada is currently examining its policies on unaccompanied minors in the light of the camp clearance arrangements under the Comprehensive Plan of Action.

      <para>
       (1) Five eligibility criteria have been established for the Scheme. These are assessed in two phases:
      </para>
      <para>
       The initial eligibility criteria of age (16-64 years) and nursing home residence are first checked from the application form submitted by applicants. People are assessed as initially eligible if they fall within the age group and are permanent residents of a nursing home; occupants of a respite bed in a nursing home for 130 days or more in the past year; or filling a nursing home-classified bed in hospital.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) conducts detailed assessments of the attendant care needs of referred applicants. Eligibility for assistance is assessed against the three remaining criteria, that: applicants have a physical disability requiring personal care assistance; are willing and able to manage daily attendant care arrangements; and that on-going health care needs can be met in the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       It must also be established that the applicant's proposal to live in the community with attendant care is a viable proposition. This includes the availability of all necessary supports and transitional requirements in adition to attendant care.
      </para>
      <para>
       Upon the recommendation of the CRS, individual applications are considered for approval. The number of places and funds available in a State are taken into account in the final approval of attendant care consumers.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Department's New South Wales Complaints Unit has developed a comprehensive protocol for complaints handling and investigation. The protocol establishes principles for complaints investigation, which briefly include provision for:
      </para>
      <para>
       * maintenance of confidentiality;
      </para>
      <para>
       * referral procedures;
      </para>
      <para>
       * interviews with residents and staff;
      </para>
      <para>
       * recognising the rights of staff; and
      </para>
      <para>
       * conciliation and negotiation procedures.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the normal course of investigating a complaint, people who may be interviewed include the complainant, the resident (if different), witnesses, the person who is the subject of the complaint, and the most senior representative of the home's management. The decision about who is interviewed, and in what order, is left to the discretion of the investigating officer. In all cases, the officers will be guided by the wishes of the resident.
      </para>
      <para>
       A copy of the protocol was sent to the Director of Nursing at the Sans Souci Nursing Home.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I accepted the report from the Department without reference to the director of Nursing as the complainant had asked to speak confidentially to the Departmental officer. The honourable member will note that no action has been taken against the nursing home because the Department wants to work with the Director of Nursing to resolve this complaint. Far from ignoring the Director of Nursing, the Department is developing a constructive solution which preserves the confidentiality of the complainant, yet establishes a basis for resolving this complaint in consultation with the Director of Nursing.

       (e) Under Finance Regulations, selection of advertising agencies is exempt from the mandatory use of public tender procedures. The standard selection procedure involves invitations to agencies to submit competitive proposals to the Department of Defence in conjunction with the Office of Government Information and Advertising. Final selection of an agency for campaign advertising requires the approval of the Ministerial Committee on Government Information and Advertising.

       (4) Yes.

       (5) Yes. As Australia had for many years cooperated with Western countries in controlling the export of dual use technology the marginal additional cost of membership was considered to be outweighed by the benefits. The benefits included new commercial advantages, for Australian firms due to more timely access to imports of technology and the ability to exercise some influence on the decision making process with regard to coverage of the controls and the procedures for their operation.

       (12) No. The COCOM regulations do not limit Australian exporters of advanced products, including Labtam, to selling in the domestic market. They do impose conditions on sales to the proscribed countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) No. Each country has an equal vote in approving exports. The US cannot unilaterally export goods which require the approval of other COCOM members.

In these letters, and on subsequent occasions, Senator Evans has restated in the clearest possible terms Australia's sporting contacts policy, which is based on the 1977 Greeneagles Declaration and was tightened by my Government in 1983. This policy has been solidly in place since that time and is well understood by the people of Australia and by other countries and international organisations such as the Commonwealth and the UN. It has exerted and continues to exert strong and effective pressure on South Africa to dismantle apartheid.''

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. In July 1987 my Department assumed responsibility for training officers with protective security advisory or management responsibilities in Commonwealth agencies. The Protective Security Training Program seeks to increase the professionalism of agency security staff in specialised areas of protective security including personnel, administrative, physical, computer and communications security and security management. A thorough review of the Program was undertaken when responsibility for the function was transferred from ASIO, at which time the course structure and content was significantly revised and updated. Comments made about the Program by Mr Justice Hope in the Report of the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies were also taken into account in that review. The revised Program also includes components which are designed to impart the information and skills required by participants to conduct security education and awareness programs in their home agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to the honourable member's reference to electronic information systems and communications security, as well as being an integral part of the Protective Security Training Program, information technology security (ITS) is being promoted through a separate ITS Course Program which has been developed over the last year. This Program is conducted jointly by my Department and the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD), which is the Government's national advisory authority on computer and communications security. These courses are aimed at computer systems officers and managers, internal auditors, computer security officers, as well as agency security advisers.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to these formal Programs several seminars and conferences have been conducted, including seminars for Senior Executive Service level officers and an annual Agency Security Advisers' Conference. In total, the training Programs and seminar and conference activities have attracted over 900 participants, and I believe have greatly encouraged an understanding and acceptance within Commonwealth agencies of the importance of securing Commonwealth information and assets requiring protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. As a result of the Government accepting a series of recommendations relating to protective security made by Mr Justice Hope in the Report of his Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies, my Department, assisted by a high level inter-departmental committee (Protective Security Policy Committee), has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Commonwealth's protective security manuals and associated policies. It is anticipated that by the middle of this year a revised, integrated Protective Security Manual (PSM) will have been endorsed by Government and issued to all Commonwealth agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both the existing and revised PSM set out the Government's protective security policy, minimum standards and recommend practices upon which agencies are to base their own protective security arrangements. The revised PSM will re-affirm existing Government policy that responsibility for security rests with individual Agency Heads. My Depart- ment will conduct a series of seminars/conferences to introduce the revised PSM to agencies, and will continue its training program for agency staff directly concerned with the management of the protective security functions.
