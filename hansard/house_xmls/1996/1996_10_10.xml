Unlike the West Coast Eagles, who are just an amalgam club, Brisbane, Sydney, Fremantle or the Adelaide Crows, Port Adelaide is the first real club to be entered into the Australian Football League. Tomorrow in Port Adelaide the new coach, John Cahill, and the board will announce the first inaugural list of players who will front up for Port Power in 1997.

        By the way, it is interesting to note that the Port Adelaide Football Club has won 34 premierships in 68 grand finals in 126 years. It is by far the most successful club in Australia. We wish Port Power and its new organisation every success next year. I notice that the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) is here. He was at the match; he, of course, has a family connection with Port Adelaide Football Club. We probably disagree on every matter except football. Perhaps he might add something as well.

        It is of immense concern that illegal activities can be promoted and demonstrated on this public information highway. We have had kids injured by people building bombs from instructions on the net. Now we see that people are having their cars stolen, thanks to instructions being bandied about on the net. While I normally do not like to advocate censorship, there is an obvious need for there to be some regulation or control of what can go out on the net to prevent this sort of information being sent everywhere around the world. I am not saying for one minute that the Internet users are criminals. But we cannot allow this information to be made publicly available without any regulation.

         —Tuesday was a very sad day for Tasmania, because the Trust Bank Tasmania, which holds a very unique position in Tasmanian history, made an appalling decision to close 10 of its branches throughout Tasmania. There were several in my electorate. The township of Geevestown, which is almost as far south in Australia as you can go, had its last remaining bank branch closed, placing an enormous social dislocation on the people of that area. There is no bank in Dover; there is now no bank in Geevestown. That area has an ageing population as well as having a very large unemployed population. Those people now have to use a very inadequate bus service to get to Huonville. One would assume that banks do have a social conscience. The managing director, Paul Kemp, has been attacked by me for the greedy profit driven position that the
         <break page="5152" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        I think it is something that the banks should take into account. It is not all profits. Some social responsibility should be shown by banks. Tuesday's decision was a very sad day for Tasmanians. People do access EFTPOS and the plastic card but this is not the only way banks should go. Over-the-counter trading is a unique part of banking and should be retained. The people in my electorate have been disadvantaged by an appalling decision by the Trust Bank to remove 10 of those branches.

I am pleased to see that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is sitting at the table. The measure used by the member for Kooyong of the NCA's performance over the years has been to divide the number of arrests by the budget and then extrapolate from that the success or otherwise of the NCA's performance on the basis of what it has cost per prosecution.

        Then there is the other assertion that the NCA ought to be somehow wound up or have its powers taken from it because it lost a particular case. If one were to use this analogy across the board one could say that one ought to wind up the Carlton Football Club because they failed to win the premiership this year or, in the case of police forces around the country, because in certain instances their performance may be down, or as a result of a number of circumstances they ought to be scrapped. Clearly that argument is nonsense.

        It is important that we recognise that the NCA is now performing a very valuable service, particularly in relation to other law enforcement agencies around the country.

It is clear from the circumstances which have attached to this situation that Mr McGinty came to that view by himself. We have one of those most unusual circumstances in politics where we have a leader who has tapped his deputy on the shoulder rather than the reverse, which occasionally occurs. I wish Mr McGinty all success in his future career in the state parliamentary party as Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia and I wish Mr Gallop, a longstanding friend and colleague, success and all the best as he endeavours to move from being leader of the state parliamentary party to Premier of Western Australia.

He is their lap dog. As the government frames its response to the ACCC report, one thing is certain: as sure as night follows day, the big oil companies, the big end of town, will be the big winners. Collins Street Costello will defend their interests at any cost, at the expense of consumers, at the expense of workers in the industry, especially tanker drivers, and at the expense of small business—the service station owners, the franchise holders, the distributors.

In truth, the oil companies control terminal access in this industry across Australia. When the Treasurer talks about access, it is small `a' access. He is trying to use Laidley as an alibi for avoiding the big `A' access issues in the industry, that is, the type of downstream access which would facilitate wholesale price competition—competition which would benefit service station operators and ultimately consumers, especially in the bush. The significance of access is to create an active market at the point of wholesale pricing, not necessarily to change the physical means by which petrol products are distributed in Australia.

        For more than 20 years, federal and state governments have been commissioning and receiving reports about petrol pricing. This has primarily been in response to community concern about pricing volatility and differential city&amp;hyphen;country pricing. These reports have not been successful because, by and large, they have failed to address the core anti&amp;hyphen;competitive structure of the petrol industry in Australia.

        This government, of course, to its lasting shame, has failed to move quickly on the Beazley bill, the measure which would amend the Trade Practices Act to outlaw the harsh and oppressive conduct of big business against the interests of franchise holders. It is a key reform for the petrol industry because there is an imbalance between market strength—the big oil companies against the franchise holders, the service station operators. They require effective protection under the Trade Practices Act. They require the passage by this House of Representatives of the Beazley bill as soon as possible. It should not be referred away to some House committee chaired by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). It should not be referred away for a report which will be ineffective in its implementation by the government; it should be acted on. There is a bill before the House and it should be debated and carried by this House of Representatives.

        Those small business interests and consumers in the industry also require strengthening of the sites act, not its abolition, as recommended by the ACCC and endorsed by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore).

        This government needs to step in right now. It should not wait for the report produced by the member for Cowan; it should not delay any further. The ACCC report was delivered to the Treasurer on 15 August. It is two months since that occurred and all he has done is sit on his hands. His response in question time a few weeks ago was no response. All he said was that the government has these things under consideration and he sought an alibi out of Laidley. It is a fraudulent alibi to talk about the Laidley agreement as a problem in the petrol industry. It has not been in operation for quite some time.

        I am very supportive of the Shell National Action Group and the letter that they have sent to all members of the House of Representatives urging proper regulation and proper Trade Practices Act amendment to protect the interests of Shell service station operators against these insidious multi&amp;hyphen;site franchises. I am pleased to quote from that open letter as follows:

        The companies intend increasing their profitability by increasing their involvement in the retail sector of the petrol industry not just for petrol but for everything sold at service stations. Shell in particular has made no secret of the fact that they want to replace all of their 600&amp;hyphen;plus independent franchisees with approximately 17 company operated networks each containing about 35 service stations. The other oil companies have indicated that they will be following Shell's lead.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Furthermore, when the other oil companies follow that lead, the temptation for retail price collusion between these network managers will be greater because it will be easier to achieve and the effects will be both immediate and spread over a wider geographical area.

        These company operated networks are not just a minor adjustment to Shell's franchise arrangements, they are a major step towards achieving the goal which the oil industry has been relentlessly pursuing in Australia for 20 years—vertical integration. And this is not in the best interests of Australian motorists as it removes the only Australian equity now present in the petroleum industry—Australian franchisees who make their investments here in Australia.

        Last week at the politics&amp;hyphen;free tax summit it was agreed by the parties present that a review of the tax system was needed: a review to bring equity to the tax system; a review to make it fair for all; a review to bring those in the community that do not pay their share of tax to account; and a review to ensure a system that is fair, honest and easy to understand. It is clear that this is not the case in Australia at the moment.

        Too many people, businesses included, are not paying their fair share of tax. Indeed, there is an article today on the front page of the

        During the last federal election the then government, now the opposition, identified some Australian scoundrels that were not paying their fair share of tax. In fact they were hoping to pick up many millions of dollars cracking down on these Australians who were not prepared to pay their fair share—a very honourable thing and I am sure this attitude would be supported by many taxpayers in the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But there are other tax avoiders within our community not paying their fair share. And it is these tax avoiders, using a quirk within the tax act, that I wish to talk about today. These tax avoiders would argue they are doing nothing wrong and meeting their tax liabilities, and I would have to admit that they would be absolutely right.

         However, this does not mean that their avoidance of tax is fair and just for the remainder of the Australian community, particularly those that have suffered and are suffering from their very commercial operations. Just because the system is abused does not make it right and I strongly believe that tax avoiders should be brought to account.

         Currently in Australia there are organisations that pay little tax, if any, even though they earn millions of dollars in profits every year. Where the inequity in the system really hits home for these organisations is when an employee earning $450 per week pays more tax than his employer. How is this possible, one might ask, when the employer has an operating profit of over $1.4 million? How is this fair—an organisation that returns a profit of over $1.4 million and pays no tax?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What would the taxpayer, the battler, the small business operator, the family trying to make ends meet paying their fair share of tax make of this? These Australians, I am sure, would think the organisation was a tax avoider and should be brought to account. And who is this organisation who is legally but unjustly avoiding tax? It is almost every registered club in Australia protected under the unfair mutuality principle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These clubs are using a quirk of the tax system to avoid paying their fair share of tax and, I might add, it is totally legal but totally unjust—totally unfair to those Australians who pay their fair share of tax and totally unfair to those businesses which are in competition and pay their share of tax. It is totally without precedent and comparison.

         The mutuality principle provides that where a number of persons contribute to a common fund that is created and managed as a common interest, any excess earnings that are generated from the use of the fund are not, for the purpose of taxation, to be considered as income. In essence, licensed clubs are only assessable for taxation on income that is earned from trading with non&amp;hyphen;members.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, I think it is time the spirit of mutuality is reviewed. Some clubs have become multimillion dollar industries and have an unfair advantage against other sections in the tourism and hospitality industry
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that do not share the same tax benefits. These clubs avoid their fair share of tax whilst at the same time they have a comprehensive competitive advantage over any competitor who pays their rightful share of tax.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some examples of where the tax exemption has benefited registered clubs which paid nil tax in 1995 include the Western Suburbs Leagues Club which had over $9 million profit, yet paid no tax; the Campbelltown Catholic Club which had over $3 million profit, but paid no tax; the Illawarra Catholic Club which had $1.7 million or more in profit, yet paid no tax; the Shell Harbour Workers Club which had $1.2 million in profit, yet paid no tax; the St George Leagues Club in Kogarah which had over $3 million in profit, yet paid no tax; and the Twin Towers Service Club which had $1.4 million of profit, yet paid no tax. These were significant profit figures yet no tax was paid on these amounts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another fine example of the way clubs can legally avoid tax and skirt around the mutuality principle is provided by the Hellenic Club in the ACT. Recently, approximately $600,000 was spent in a promotion activity for the club to attract patrons—not members, but patrons. Offers of a house worth more than $230,000 to be won was advertised with full pages in local community newspapers. In addition, there were 1,000 free return flights to the Gold Coast up for grabs, costing around $340,000. Surely, promotions like these, which are very elaborate, must be a disadvantage to tax&amp;hyphen;paying businesses which simply cannot afford promotions or give&amp;hyphen;aways like these.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Where do they get this excess money to provide such fantastic rewards for their patrons? It is clear that it is by avoiding tax through the mutuality principle. This legal tax avoidance must stop and it must stop on the basis of tax equity. It must stop because it provides a commercially unfair advantage to clubs and it must stop because these operations are not paying their fair share of tax.

          To change the system does not introduce a new tax—far from it. To change the system just means that the clubs pay taxes on their businesses, like all other commercial oper ations in Australia. But it is not only me calling for a change in the system; in March 1995 these inequities were brought to the attention of the House—under the previous Labor government—by the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration.

         The committee noted:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         On the evidence presented to it, the Committee concludes that the application of the mutuality principle has benefited some clubs to a degree where they are able to compete unfairly with businesses which do not have similar taxation advantage. In this respect mutuality, as it applies to clubs which engage in substantial commercial activity, is inconsistent with the equity criterion of good taxation, and requires review.

         Why should the vast majority of Australians pay their fair share of tax and, because of some outdated quirk in the tax system, these multimillion dollar enterprises do not?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to emphasise that the role of a community club is not to be underestimated. They provide a valuable service for their members and the community. However, the original premise for the mutuality principle is that it is for the benefit of the club or association as under section 23G of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Other businesses in the industry such as hotels, gymnasiums, butchers and video hire stores are being drastically disadvantaged because they do not have the same tax exemption.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These multimillion dollar operations which do not pay their fair share of tax operate under the Waratah formula. This relies on the club providing a sample of non&amp;hyphen;member visitors and then applying this figure to turnover, and thus profit. This very loose income tax procedure requires urgent regulation to ensure that these tax avoiders pay their fair share of tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My grievance today is not with the massive benefits these multimillion dollar operations receive from avoiding their fair share of tax;

          my grievance is with the inequities of the taxation system in Australia. The issue I have raised today is but one example where sections in the tourism and hospitality industry are disadvantaged because of the anomalies in the taxation system.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The standing committee recommended that the Treasurer refer this matter to the Industry Commission. I believe the commission should look favourably at the standing committee's recommendations. They should thoroughly examine and review the mutuality principle because, in my opinion, the original meaning and objectives of mutuality are not being met. These multimillion dollar organisations are avoiding their share of the tax burden with which nearly every Australian complies. Is it possible that the Commonwealth is missing out on an estimated $500 million—that is, half a billion dollars—per year in tax revenue from this quirk in the tax system? For the sake of all Australian taxpayers I urge those with the governing power to fix this stupid regulation and to do so very quickly.

          —The honourable member calls the members of Penrith Panthers Leagues Club tax avoiders. I have to say to the honourable member for Cowan that his party has a rather chequered record on this issue because this is an issue which the Australian Hotels Association has been pushing for for some time. The Australian Hotels Association, quite legitimately, have always objected to the fact that the owners of hotels pay tax on their profits whereas clubs which compete with hotels have not been subject to the same principles under the taxation act.

         When this issue was put to the Liberal Party and the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, at the last election he gave some very interesting replies. When the Australian Hotels Association went to Mr Costello they asked him whether he would give them an assurance that clubs would have to pay tax. Mr Costello, the current Treasurer, said that he would be prepared to establish an inquiry into whether or not it would be fairer for clubs to be subject to tax in the same way as hotels and other corporations.

         That might be well and good; that is the Treasurer agreeing with the principles outlined by the honourable member for Cowan. But the Treasurer was also lobbied by the clubs' representative, the Registered Clubs Association. He gave a very different answer to the Registered Clubs Association when they sought an assurance from him that there would be no inquiry into the taxation regime that applies to clubs. We had the Liberal Party giving completely contradictory assurances to the hotels and the clubs about whether or not there would be an inquiry into the tax regime for the club industry.

         If the honourable member for Cowan honestly believes that clubs should pay tax and that there should be no benefit for clubs under the mutuality principle, then let him go down to the main street of Penrith and shout, as loud as he can, that he thinks Penrith Panthers Leagues Club should be paying tax and that the members of Penrith Panthers Leagues Club are tax dodgers.

          I would like to make a few remarks about issues that affect not just my electorate but areas in the outer suburbs of Sydney—areas like your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins—in areas such as western Sydney. There were a number of decisions made by this government in the August budget which will severely disadvantage people on modest and low incomes. The decision that I consider the most callous in this the budget was the decision to completely abolish the Commonwealth dental health program.

          The Howard government's decision to abolish the $100 million Commonwealth dental health program is going to seriously disadvantage about four million Australians who are either pensioners or cardholders throughout this country. In western Sydney last year, 21,000 of these Australians received treatment thanks to that Commonwealth funding; 21,000 people in western Sydney were able to have emergency dental care or were able to have essential dental care provided under the Commonwealth dental health program.

          In my capacity as the federal shadow minister for health, I have visited dental clinics in several states. It is only when you meet the people in the waiting rooms of the dental clinics that you realise this is not just an argument about numbers, about how many millions of dollars and whether the federal or the state government should be funding this program. This is not an argument about economics or numbers; this is an argument about whether elderly people should live in pain because they need some emergency dental care.

          The other point I want to touch on very briefly is that there is another threat to the people living in western Sydney—a threat to their local public hospitals, those at Westmead, Mount Druitt and Nepean. It comes from this government's decision to cut back federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million over the next four years. The federal cutback to public hospitals will mean that there will be enormous pressures on the good people who work for those public hospitals, on the number of beds and on the number of staff who are employed in places like Mount Druitt, Nepean and Westmead hospitals.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          New South Wales still does not know how much its federal funding is going to be cut back. The budget papers say that in addition to lots of other cuts there will be $70 million taken out this year and in the next four years, allegedly for cost shifting. New South Wales, and every other state, is a quarter of the way into this financial year. As far as I am aware, no state health minister has yet been told how much of that $70&amp;hyphen;odd million in federal funding cuts they will have to bear.

          How can the people who run the budgets of the hospitals of Nepean, Westmead and Mount Druitt know how much money they have to spend this financial year when Dr Wooldridge will not tell Dr Refshauge how much the federal funding cuts are going to hit our state? Minister, it is cutbacks like the federal funding cutbacks announced in your budget that will simply lengthen the waiting lists at these hospitals; that will make it that

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I will touch on a range of subjects this morning concerning Australia generally, but particularly regional Australia. I want to start with a few comments about the railway systems of Australia. Over the last decade or more, probably more like 20 years, we have seen job losses in the railways of between 50,000 and 100,000, so there is a vast change occurring in the railway systems of Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We currently have a situation where the Commonwealth owns two loss&amp;hyphen;making railways—National Rail and Australian National. That is not that unusual because that has been the traditional way of running rail for more than a century—government owned and government supported. But the problem highlighted by the Brew report, which only repeats what the previous government already knew in reports to them in 1992 and 1995, is that there is a huge gap between the necessity to get rail up to performing its task and the reality that is occurring. There were some very brave efforts made but, nevertheless, we have seen this huge loss in employment and, in the case of AN alone, we will be seeing the work force drop from 10,500 in 1983 to approximately 1,500 by the middle of 1997. I do not want to dwell on that; I just say it as a matter of history.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The most important thing is that railways be given every opportunity to focus on the national transport task into the next century. Rail performs approximately a quarter of the transport task across Australia. The transport
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         task is worth about $30 billion; rail is worth something like $8 billion.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Over the decades of this debate there has been the constant catchcry of private enterprise versus public enterprise—sadly, I think, to the detriment of the rail industry. No&amp;hyphen;one would be surprised to hear that the coalition government is a supporter of private enterprise and that it is looking to those principles to maximise opportunities for rail.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is pleasing to see those people who have been perhaps traditional enemies of that approach be challenged and in many ways be supportive. I say `challenged' because traditionally the union movement would have been, perhaps unquestionably, supported by the membership. I will quote from the Port Augusta newspaper, the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Transcontinental
        </emphasis>
        , of 14 August where it is reported that workers passed a motion of no confidence in public transport union state organiser Mr John Crossing following a meeting convened by him at that period. In fact, the men decided they would not go on strike and passed unanimously a motion that John Crossing would not be welcomed back in Port Augusta. I think that is indicative of the changing mind&amp;hyphen;set.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When we see these fundamental figures—that is, 50,000 to 100,000 job losses in the last 10 or 20 years in the rail industry, and job losses in AN from 10,500 to 1,500 by mid&amp;hyphen;1997—then everybody is coming to the realisation that we have to do it differently to give rail the best chance in the future. As I say, there is at least an $8 billion business there which can, managed properly, serve this country well into the 21st century.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The next subject I will touch on this morning is the Child Support Agency. I want to highlight three simple propositions. The adversarial nature of this business when we are seeing a rise in marriage breakdown highlights the problem in a very dramatic way. I know the parliamentary inquiry and the report highlighted this in many ways, and the response from the community was unprecedented.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, I believe there needs to be far greater incentive in the system, free of government interference—free, if you like, of
        <break page="5163" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the Child Support Agency approach—which gives incentives to both parties to negotiate with a much stronger sense of good faith rather than at times with a sense of vindictiveness at a time when a relationship is at its most fragile.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also wish to highlight this morning that I believe there needs to be far greater recognition of the income of the custodial parent along with that of the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent. The fact that people can have between 18 per cent and 40 per cent of their gross income taken from them in a summary fashion seems to me inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third point I wish to make about the Child Support Agency is that it is ironically the harshest, it seems, on those, particularly women, who are part of a second relationship. As a marriage breaks down and the pain of that is dealt with and people move on to a second relationship, that relationship should not be penalised by, I suppose, historical legislation, and certainly not by historical baggage. No&amp;hyphen;one who has visited my office has denied their responsibility to care for children, but they do believe it should be much fairer, much more balanced, and able to be dealt with in a spirit of reconciliation, particularly for the children.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will briefly move on to Austudy and the means test. There are some people receiving the Austudy payment that should not, but equally there are those who have been penalised by this approach. Once again, it is the regional people who are the most penalised. The most common complaint I am getting in my electorate office is that there is a degree of comfort for many of those who receive Austudy compared with a significant degree of hardship for those who sometimes receive it and sometimes do not.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So there is an iniquitous situation in Austudy and, in some cases, the actual means test is exacerbating that. I simply reinforce, as I have done many times in the past, that in regional Australia often there is no choice; they need to go to cities to get their education qualifications. This is at a time when adjustment in agriculture and other industries is significant. The demand for education is
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         higher and there is a greater need for regional people; yet they are being penalised still.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) touched on petrol pricing. I just remind the member for Werriwa that in 1983 the excise rate was 6c a litre and when the Labor Party left office it was 36c a litre. There are issues about market power, and the government is addressing them as expeditiously as it can. That increase from 6c a litre to 36c a litre highlights the impact the price of fuel had, particularly in regional areas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My final comment this morning will endeavour to deal with the media and journalists. I must admit that I thought there was a design fault in this place when I saw the media sitting up there in judgment on us. I felt that it might be more appropriate if they were at our level. Nevertheless, I make that general comment. I think it was Tom Burton who said in that wonderful piece on SBS in the coverage of the last federal election that they become players in the political process. I think he said that they get it right about 70 per cent of the time, so I suppose we presume they get it wrong 30 per cent of the time. My concern is not with particular individuals or particular parts of the media. Sometimes we will hear the private media versus the public media—

         On a flying visit to Dubbo and Bathurst, he came to realise that one of the critical issues facing voters in the seats of Parkes, Calare, Hume and Gwydir, and even further afield, was the future of the proposed inland freight airport at Parkes. Only the week before the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, had visited Parkes and promised a returned Labor govern ment would pay for a feasibility study into the Parkes airport proposal. Mr Fischer had no alternative but to promise to match Mr Keating's undertaking, and he did—not once, but twice—in media interviews on the day.

        Now, seven months after the election, still no money has been forthcoming. Mr Fischer, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) all seem to have lost interest in the proposal. The Parkes freight airport project and its associated Inland Marketing Corporation concept is no pie in the sky scheme. It is a well thought out and researched proposal to ensure Australia's agricultural exports are delivered in a quick and economical manner to growing Asian markets.

        Paul Keating could see its potential. So could Tim Fischer—until he found himself in government. Instead, the National Party now supports throwing money at Canberra and Adelaide airports. A highly questionable upgrading of Adelaide airport, many experts say, is a waste of money aimed at propping up the Liberal state government in South Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In Canberra's case, the FAC is looking at wasting a million dollars on a study looking at its freight potential, yet anyone with even a basic knowledge of freight airports can tell you at no charge that Canberra is clearly unsuitable as a freight airport. Last week, in an interview with ABC radio, the transport minister had the audacity to suggest the federal government was not putting any money into the Canberra airport study, that it was being funded by the Federal Airports Corporation. It is clearly funding endorsed by this government, whatever its source. To say otherwise is simply to play with words.

        The Inland Marketing Corporation's Parkes airport concept is supported by 33 local councils from inland New South Wales. Deputy Speaker, if you are at all familiar with country councils, you would know they are a pretty conservative bunch. Yet these 33 conservative mayors and their councillors realise just how much potential the Parkes airport proposal has to offer. Many of them have put money into pushing it to the stage it

         is at now. It is estimated to cost $55 million, but they are not asking for that much money. All they want the government to do is to pay up the $300,000 it promised to allow them to carry out a full feasibility study. If it is not feasible, they say, they will forget about it.

        Last week, after the transport minister announced a million dollars would be spent looking at freight options for Canberra, 23 of these conservative councils came together for a crisis meeting at Parkes. The Parkes Mayor, Robert Wilson, told the meeting the National Party member for Parkes had failed to represent the area, had failed to pass on submissions to the minister and had worked against the Parkes airport proposal.

        The scathing criticism of the National Party did not end there. The Mayor of Cowra, Bruce Miller, who hails from the electorate of Hume, the transport minister's electorate, put forward two motions to that meeting. The first condemned the National Party leader, Tim Fischer, for breaking his election promise to provide that $300,000 towards the Parkes study. The second motion called on the National Party to `do what it was set up to do and start representing country people'. Both motions were passed unanimously without a single word of dissent. Even the newly elected state National Party member for Orange, who was present at the time the vote was taken, failed to speak out against these motions. Indeed, the member for Orange, Russell Turner, says:

Indeed, support comes from as far away as Bourke and Inverell, while a seafood processor I recently spoke with in Hobart was enthusiastic about the need for a freight outlet like Parkes to get his produce to Asian markets. Parkes is clearly the only freight airport proposal with widespread public support.

        In his interview with ABC radio last week, the transport minister dismissed the Parkes proposal, saying there were a dozen other freight airport proposals in New South Wales. He dismissed the Deputy Prime Minister's broken promise, claiming the government had honoured its election commitment by referring the Parkes proposal—along with the dozen or so others—to the parliamentary inquiry looking at freight airport proposals.

        Quite simply, there are not a dozen other freight airport proposals in New South Wales. I can name only four. None of them are anywhere near as advanced or have the same level of backing as Parkes. As for trying to justify Mr Fischer's broken promise by saying that government had instead set up an inquiry into the freight airport proposals, the inquiry is nothing new. It was set up by the Labor government before the election and is being continued, in essence, by the current Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform Standing Committee of this House.

We need an infrastructure that can take the freshest, cleanest, greenest produce in the world from the producing valleys of south&amp;hyphen;east Australia—the orchards of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland—and the fisheries, too, of the south-east, and deliver them via a dedicated freight outlet which is serviced by a national highway system and a national rail system and a container port intermodal transport facility. This is a community that is desperate for the economic boost such a project would deliver. This is a community that has made more than a fair sacrifice to keep this country afloat during the droughts and commodity crises of the past decade and half.

        That infrastructure, wanting only an enlarged airport, already exists in the central west at Parkes. There are 33 councils around the state eager to support this scheme. They only want a vote of confidence, a recognition of the work they have put in. The vision they have is worthy of serious study. They want to stack this project up against anything else being considered. They want to challenge the doubters who are peddling untruths and belittling this scheme on narrow parochial grounds, or perhaps their airline interests feel threatened by the entrepreneurial activities of other international air carriers in the freight import&amp;hyphen;export area.

        Feminism has been one of the greatest advances in the free Western world. The progress and ongoing emancipation that women are achieving is due in part to women gathering together to share common experiences, thoughts, desires, goals and frustrations. Women have achieved great advances for not only themselves but the whole community and the nation's future. Primarily the advances made by the women's movement can be described in social justice terms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Exposure, recognition and validation of women's issues have demanded structural changes to society. Men have also been called on to address their behaviours, attitudes, beliefs and lifestyles in order to accommodate these ever&amp;hyphen;changing social justice issues. Men are required to adapt to these issues, which can at times be difficult to grasp and can demand a complete overhaul of outmoded thinking.

        Society is currently feeling the friction that such evolving gender roles can create. Men, not given any formal education in these areas, are often left bewildered, confused and neglected by these rapidly changing processes. When society finds itself in this precarious gender laden confusion, a range of outcomes is possible. They extend from the traditionalist males who may reject outright such changes and form radical backlash movements through

        A change in any one gender's demands for rights inherently affects our society, which in turn makes demands upon the other gender. The feminist movement largely concerns itself with its own issues and rights. Rightly, it does not, nor should it, have to ask permission from men to air these issues or exercise its rights.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This lack of consultation is almost a prerequisite to enable a truly free voice to be heard. It is not the women's responsibility to concern themselves with the effects their increasing freedom has upon men. Apart from being patronising to men, this would have a constraining effect on the efficacy of feminism. This responsibility rests squarely on the shoulders of men. Men must address their own issues. In a complementary manner, men need the same lateral freedom for discussion so that their concerns and issues can likewise develop and help to enrich our community, for it is only when both genders feel emancipated that a harmonious society can thrive.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The validation of women's rights is indicative of a level of gender maturation that enables women to have a voice that is not only freely spoken but also heard. Men, unfortunately, do not have a unified voice to achieve the same level of maturation. This lack of cohesion among men may have come about for many reasons. This could be due to an assumed patriarchal position of privilege, a lack of structural placements, a lack of acceptance by society of such placements or perhaps a lack of communication in men themselves due to the way they have been socialised.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It comes as no surprise that, as the Australian male adjusts to the demands of the changing society in the 1990s, he is realising the obvious benefits of communication, with ever increasing interest being shown in discussion groups, community interests and the challenging of outmoded assumptions made about men. Men around Australia are now waking up to discuss how society is changing, and they are discussing the impact this may have on their lives. Men are looking to forums to discuss issues which affect not only them but
        <break page="5167" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        Men's groups are springing up throughout the country, concerned with issues ranging from family law matters to emotion and stress management, and the exploration of gender issues. In Australia at the moment there are over 1,800 different men's groups—often disjointed, unstructured, ill-funded or led by fanatical extremists who are frustrated with the lack of easily accessible channels to either obtain resources or air their beliefs.

        In this embryonic stage of men's discovery, it is important to recognise the different needs that are likely to arise and that men's experiences and problems are likely to be unique. Men's services should not be a duplication of women's services, nor a stall to dispense feminist theory. Men should be given the dignity and right to discuss and discover for  themselves their own areas of concern and to develop a discourse to explain their needs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A content and happy society is, after all, achievable only when both genders have a voice in determining their own needs and resources. Men require a unified voice with a structure that advocates their concerns. Presently men are left isolated to lobby individually. Until only recently, men had no special funding set aside for men's health issues. As it is, men's funding is limited to physical health issues such as testicular and prostate cancer.

        This is a good beginning. However, men require services beyond the mere physical. Men in Australia have suicide rates that are three to four times higher than those for women. In Queensland, separated males have suicide rates up to 7.6 times higher than those for married males. Australia and New Zealand have the shame of being the only two Western countries that have a male adolescent suicide rate that exceeds their general suicide rate. Male rural suicides similarly have an unacceptably appalling high rate. Men need a range of proactive services to help reduce these `deaths by neglect' of our male population. I am heartened that this government has already made concerted steps in addressing this serious problem. An important part of

        Men's counselling services are needed that deal with issues such as sexual traumas, loss, grief and coping, and family and relationship breakdowns. Men cry too! Counselling services are also required for perpetrators of child and adult sexual abuse. To curb instances of child abuse, a telephone service is needed whereby abusers can call to either discuss the situation and seek help or talk to someone because they feel they are about to abuse again. This telephone line should be confidential with anonymity guaranteed. This would provide an avenue for perpetrators to discuss their intentions instead of carrying them out and will hopefully lead to ongoing counselling. More importantly, this would provide a service not offered before which could dramatically reduce instances of child abuse.

        Men's services should supply a structure so that other men's discussion groups and educational services can grow. Discussion nights on divorce, family law and sexual harassment legislation would all be instructive to men. Discussion nights can educate men on rape, domestic violence, theories of manhood, relationships, communication, anger management, suicide, fatherhood, intimacy, depression and stress management. Indeed, proactive education is the key to any good counselling service offered, as prevention is always better than cure.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, men in today's society are under an ever increasing suspicion of guilt. This is easily illustrated if you consider whether or not you as a man would stop your car to ask a seemingly lost child if they are all right. I wonder how many men would do this. Men have, despite an ever changing world, inherited a legacy of a very negative stereotype. Men are portrayed in the media as violent, potential rapists and as being preoccupied with sex, power and control issues. Men are increasingly frustrated with this legacy and are asking for a shift in society's appreciation and perception of them.

        The current devaluing of men has far&amp;hyphen;reaching ramifications for society. Unfortunately, men in the 1990s are subjected to a large number of generalisations concerning their nature. It is a pity that society continues to stereotype men based on the offensive behaviours of a few.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The House, very clearly from the Speaker's statement, has had no involvement whatsoever in this purchase. Similarly, inquiries today have elicited the fact that the tax exemption number which is essentially required in these processes—in this transaction DA0156—has nothing whatsoever to do with the House of Representatives. Similarly, contact with the office of the Minister for Administrative Services this morning indicates that there
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         have been no contacts, no approaches and no purchase by that department. Similarly, the Parliamentary Information Systems Office—another broad possibility that represents members of parliament—indicate that they do not have a number. In their case, they simply provide a statement that the goods are free of sales tax under item 74 of the first schedule et cetera. The company assures me that this equipment was delivered to the office of the former member for Lindsay within the parliament. So the question widens as to the whole process.

        I think this must be viewed in the context of a few matters, including the firm commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech of 30 April upon his election when he spoke of `the government's intention to improve the standing of the national Parliament' and expressed concern that `increasing numbers in the community have lost respect for the Parliament and its members'. Similarly, on 2 March the Prime Minister actually took the opportunity to put up&amp;hyphen;front that one of the aims of the government was supposedly to `restore decency, standards and honesty to our national government'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As an MP I must express some concern at this whole process. As late as 30 September the General Manager of Ministerial and Parliamentary Services, Mr Semmens, at a Senate estimates committee indicated quite clearly that there were limitations on the rights of members of parliament to the equipment they received through that role. He indicated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are talking about dollars. I have a rolling replacement program to fund both computers and other equipment, and I do not have, in that budget, funds to accommodate much variation. Of course, it is very difficult to predict just how many might express an interest were there to be some leeway given to these kinds of requests.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is very clear that there is no intention by the government, no intention by the parliament, to extend further rights in this field to members of parliament. We all know that the senators and members entitlements document lists exactly what we can receive as representatives of the people as people funded by the Australia taxpayer. Certainly, beyond that
        <break page="5169" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         limit, there is no right. Most members would understand that they cannot just go off to a company saying, `I am a member of parliament. I have certain rights. Give me some computers. Give me this equipment. It is tax exempt et cetera.' I for one am a person without legal training but at a very early time I got the impression from the department and other sources that that is just not the way things operate around here.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The question of gaining tax exemption improperly is not a trifling matter. It is subject to the Taxation Administration Act of 1953, which provides alternatives of a $2,000 fine or, in certain circumstances, at the behest of the commissioner, a $5,000 fine or a prison sentence up to one year. So, whatever some people might seem to indicate, these are not trifling, irrelevant matters. I thought it was quite topical this morning when I heard the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) quite clearly indicating his concern about tax evasion, his concern about standards in this country with regard to people paying the right tax. I am not the only one who is concerned about the way this type of operation might have occurred.

        The situation is that there was delivery to the house itself. The reception of this material occurred after the legal representatives of the former member for Lindsay quite emphatically, quite clearly, indicated to the High Court of this country: `Our client has no right to be here; she has never been a member of parliament but we will want to argue about whether it is a re&amp;hyphen;count or a by&amp;hyphen;election.' After that date a person who in reality had no entitlement to be here took delivery of this material which the company's invoice indicated to be tax exempt. We all know we have no right to tax exemption. We have no right even if we are still legitimate members of the parliament, if we are still here quite properly through election.

        We have a situation where there is a requirement that there is a purchase order with a sales tax exemption number—an indication or quotation of a number—derived from the Taxation Office and signed by an appropriate person. I myself today still do not know who has signed any authorisation document. There
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         must have been one. One assumes that the company has proper practices—and they seemed to indicate over the phone that they do. One does still not know how this number, DA0156, was provided to them.

        It is also worth further noting that I have been advised by Southmark that the company supplying this, Digital, went further to provide a deal which `they would do only for major companies or major clients'. So it was not a five-second phone call to Southmark requesting a computer and maybe some accidental intimation for which someone around the place might have a tax exemption number and errors, mistakes and misunderstandings. Not only was the tax exemption given, not only was a number cited; the deal was over and above the ordinary because Digital considered that it was not dealing with a Tom, a Dick or a Harry off the street but a major customer; someone that was part of the government.

I know that if I undertook this kind of action I would be regarded as dishonest. I know that the electorate would regard me as such. I know that I would be dishonest if I had received this material knowing that I had been given a tax exemp tion for which no way in the broadest possibility did I have any entitlement. These are questions that the former member for Lindsay must answer. They are questions that go to those matters that the Prime Minister raises. They go to concerns about propriety. They go to concerns about exactly what the Australian electorate will tolerate from its representatives.

How ridiculous can you get? I ask you: what business has the time, let alone the resources, to complete such a request? This is bureaucracy gone mad.

          —The JCPA report No. 346 I am tabling today is of paramount importance to the future of the parliament itself. Prior to the 1996 election, the Hon. John Howard, now Prime Minister, gave a commitment to the Australian people to establish a completely independent Auditor-General who would be an officer of the parliament, as part of a broader strategy to restore authority, dignity and meaning to parliamentary institutions. The existence of a strong and independent Auditor-General is fundamental to the effectiveness of the parliament itself in its scrutiny of executive government. Indeed, a former Auditor-General told the JCPA in 1994 that he considered the question—who will control the Auditor-General?—to be one of the great battles between the parliament and the executive. It is a battle which has had a long history.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1902, the first Auditor-General in his first report to parliament stated that his office was inadequately resourced for the discharge of its audit functions. The JCPA has reported to parliament twice in the last decade on the desirability of strengthening the relationship between parliament and the Auditor-General. In its report No. 296 tabled in 1989, the JCPA informed parliament that the Australian Audit Office, as it was then, was in a state of crisis, that it was underresourced and that a lot of problems stemmed from parliamentary complacency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The JCPA also reported that there was confusion about whether the executive or the parliament was responsible for the Auditor-General, with the result that the office was neglected by both. In report 331, tabled in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          1994, the JCPA made a series of recommendations to amend the Auditor-General Bill 1994 to enhance the functional independence of the Auditor-General from the executive and provide for greater parliamentary involvement in the performance of the audit function. Today, seven years on from the original JCPA report, the question of where the Auditor-General fits in the framework of government still generates heated debate, as the committee discovered during this inquiry. However, the incumbent Auditor-General, Mr Pat Barrett, was in no doubt that he considers parliament to be his employer.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this report the JCPA has recommended that the Auditor-General be declared in the Auditor-General Bill to be an independent officer of the parliament. The title encapsulates the role and status of the office of Auditor-General. The Auditor-General performs a function that is essential to parliament and parliamentary scrutiny but which the parliament itself has neither the technical expertise nor the resources to perform.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While acknowledging that the debate about the status of the Auditor-General is essentially about symbolism, we believe that symbolism is extremely important. To a very large degree, the way in which the position of Auditor-General is described influences public perceptions of the role and the significance of the office. It is important to note, however, that in the legislative model proposed by the JCPA the Auditor-General would not be subject to direction by the parliament. The JCPA has recommended that a guarantee of the Auditor-General's audit independence be enshrined in the Auditor-General Bill, putting beyond doubt that the Auditor-General has complete discretion in determining the audit program of the ANAO, the Australian National Audit Office, and in deciding the manner in which audits will be conducted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), in referring this matter to the JCPA for inquiry, drew the committee's attention to the concerns that appointment of the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament could damage the independence of that office. The committee has reviewed the legal opinions  obtained by the Australian National Audit Office on
         <break page="5173" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          this issue. The committee is concerned that these legal opinions were obtained in a vacuum of policy advice about the intentions or will of the government and the parliament in appointing the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament. This is criticism neither of the legal opinions nor of those who sought them, but it is the reason why some of the legal concerns raised in the inquiry are not relevant to what the JCPA is recommending in this report.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee has attempted to allay the fears about the appointment of the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament in this report, outlining in some detail what the JCPA means by that title and recommending provisions to be included in the Auditor-General Bill to clarify the meaning and intended ramifications of the title. In the JCPA's legislative model regarding the independence of the Auditor-General both the position of Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office would be established as statutory offices for whom the Prime Minister would take portfolio responsibility.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An important element of the new framework to underpin the independence of the Auditor-General is the establishment of an audit committee of parliament. The audit committee on behalf of the parliament would enhance the transparency of decisions taken in relation to the Auditor-General. In particular, the audit committee would approve the appointment of the Auditor-General, examine the proposed appropriations for the Australian National Audit Office and make recommendations to parliament and to the executive on appropriate levels of resourcing, monitor any executive directions to the Auditor-General and approve the appointment of the independent auditor and advise the independent auditor of parliament's audit priorities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          In his letter of referral, the Minister for Finance confirmed his intention to seek cabinet agreement that the JCPA be given the function of an audit committee. The JCPA is enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming an audit committee. The audit committee functions are an integral part of the JCPA's existing broad role of reporting to the parlia ment on means for improving public accountability.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this report the JCPA has also recommended a range of measures that could be incorporated in the new Auditor-General Bill to support the functional independence of the Auditor-General. The committee was flying blind, not having been given a preview of the Auditor-General Bill 1996 and thus not being in a position to suggest specific amendments or additions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee has recommended that the Auditor-General Bill provide for the Auditor-General to have a mandate to conduct the full range of financial and performance audits across the entire public sector, including performance audit in government business enterprises. The committee has also recommended that the Auditor-General Bill provide for the Auditor-General to be appointed for a fixed term of 10 years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It will be apparent in this report that the JCPA considers the independence of the Auditor-General to be absolutely fundamental to public accountability in Australia. If the Auditor-General is not properly resourced or does not have a legislative mandate to carry out an effective and broad scrutiny of the public sector, then parliament itself is compromised in its ability to hold the executive government to account. I commend this report to parliament. I urge members and senators to take an interest not only in this report but also in the work of the Auditor-General, whose future effectiveness will have a major impact on the effectiveness of the parliament itself.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This report contains a series of recommendations which pose a challenge to the government. If adopted, these recommendations will go a long way towards restoring the authority and meaning of the parliament and securing the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's independence from the executive. In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues on the JCPA, all those who gave evidence to the inquiry and the JCPA secretariat, whose collective commitment to the task has enabled the committee to table this report within two months of receiving the reference requested by the minister.

         </emphasis>
         was tabled and the passage of legislation flowing from that report has been some time coming. But it is almost here and I do believe that the commitment by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) `to establish a completely independent Auditor&amp;hyphen;General so that a fearless and authoritative surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the executive' has given an important impetus to bringing the process of reform to fruition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report outlines the key components of the functional independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General: personal independence in relation to appointment and tenure; a wide legislative mandate empowering the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to audit the complete spectrum of Commonwealth functions; freedom to determine the audit program and to decide the nature and scope of audits; unrestricted access to information and the right to report any findings to the parliament; and adequate resourcing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Enhancing the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's independence through the mode of appointment and tenure is vital. The committee's recommendations do this by involving the parliament, through the audit committee, in approving by a two&amp;hyphen;thirds majority the government's nominee for appointment and by conducting a public confirmation hearing to take evidence from the nominee prior to approval.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The term of appointment of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General was given considerable attention by the committee. In my personal view, if there is any single office of the Commonwealth that would justify appointment until retirement, it is that of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. This is particularly so given the fact that reappointment for a further term is not an option because it would substantially erode the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's independence, as anyone who has
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          witnessed the sad sight of a statutory officer seeking a further term would attest. Nonetheless, the committee's recommendation for a 10&amp;hyphen;year term is, I believe, a very effective alternative.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With regard to the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's mandate to audit Commonwealth functions, there has been something of a tradition of affirming the need for an unrestricted mandate, yet qualifying this when it comes down to brass tacks. The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill 1994 significantly qualified the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's mandate by exempting government business enterprises from performance audits unless there was a request by the minister or by both houses of the parliament. While some shred of intellectual legitimacy may be given to such an exemption by murmurings about GBEs being subjected to market disciplines, no&amp;hyphen;one who has witnessed the lack of market discipline operating on some government business enterprises could take this seriously in real life.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Government business enterprises do spend taxpayers' money, they not infrequently waste it, and the parliament's capacity to make judgments on this should not be limited by exempting them from the scrutiny of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. In addition, I think it is a matter of principle that grand statements about unrestricted audit mandates should be accompanied by commensurate legislative powers. It is therefore laudable that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has bitten the bullet and matched recommendation to principle by including performance audits of government business enterprises.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The task of securing the independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General has both symbolic and substantive aspects. While the Audit Act 1901 leaves the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's independence implicit, and this has not resulted in any executive interference in the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's capacity to determine which audits would be conducted, the committee believes it is important that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's complete discretion in the discharge of audit functions and the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's freedom from any direction should be specified in legislation.

          The independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and the capacity of the parliament to fulfil its task of scrutiny depends on the ability of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to report to the parliament. The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill 1994, however, did contain substantial qualification on the ability of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to report to the parliament. Most importantly, there is a wide ranging provision that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General not release sensitive information in a report tabled in the parliament if—and I quote:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General had issued a certificate to the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General stating that the release of the information would be contrary to the public interest.
         </para>
         <para>
          The definition of `sensitive information' was so extensive that the committee could not visualise any form of moderately interesting information about government activities that could not be fitted into one or other of its categories. This was particularly concerning for the committee since the bill established no checks on the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's power to issue a certificate and the parliament was not even to be informed that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General had given a direction to the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, let alone the reasons for the direction. It might seem far&amp;hyphen;fetched that this power would be exercised, but providing for such a capacity is in principle inappropriate. And if it is not to be used, why have it?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive information should be restricted to the disclosure of information likely to prejudice national security; that the audit committee should receive an unabridged copy of the report; and that reasons for the exclusion of sensitive information should be reported to the parliament.

          A key bone of contention over the years has been the issue of resourcing the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. This has long been regarded as going to the heart of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's true independence.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee regarded it as being of fundamental importance that the resourcing of audit functions should be made transparent to the parliament, thus allowing the parliament to hold the executive to account for the level of resources appropriated for the Auditor&amp;hyphen;

          Accordingly, the committee proposes that the audit committee should examine the estimates of the Australian National Audit Office and make recommendations to the parliament and to the responsible minister—who, given that the committee's recommendations are accepted, will be the Prime Minister—on the appropriate level of funding for the ANAO. The ANAO's estimates and the recommendation of the audit committee would then be considered by the executive as part of the normal budget process.

          I turn finally to the issue of the designation of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General as an independent officer of the parliament. The Prime Minister had indicated that the new government would make the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General an officer of the parliament. Nonetheless, the designation of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General did exercise the mind of the committee and it certainly exercised the minds of some departments and authorities.

          Having considered the various views, the committee concluded that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General for Australia should be appointed and titled as an `Independent officer of the parliament'. The committee believes that this would be a very important symbol of the independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's primary role in assisting the parliament in its scrutiny of the exercise of authority and the expenditure of public funds by the executive.

          , follows on from a couple of other reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, Nos 296 in 1989 and 331 in 1994. In the 3&amp;half; years that I have now been on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's role, his particular tasks, funding and independence have engendered quite a bit of debate. It would be recognised on all sides that auditors&amp;hyphen;general, certainly the two that I have worked with as a member of this committee, have diligently performed their duties, as have their staff. They have certainly performed a great service to the parliament and the country.

         But symbolism, part of which this report is about, has been a major issue of discussion on the role of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. Although the report is not exciting reading, like many reports of the Public Accounts Committee, it is fairly weighty and contains a range of issues worthy of serious consideration by the government. And I will mention several of those today but, to ensure that others have an opportunity to speak, I will then sit down quickly.

         On the role of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General as an officer of the parliament, there was some debate on whether that was a good, bad or indifferent idea. Through this report we have tried to hold on to the most important aspect of that, while at the same time taking into account some of the concerns raised by some government departments as to what the role really means. I certainly believe that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General not only being independent but being seen to be independent is crucial to

         There are a number of recommendations on the audit committee. The JCPA believes that the committee has a role to play in appointing the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General; examining the appropriations to the ANAO; reviewing the performance of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General in consultation with the independent auditor; and reporting to parliament on the operation of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General—all crucial issues to the operation of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Complaints have been made in the past which, to some extent, have been legitimate—and I know they go back to the earlier part of this century—that auditors&amp;hyphen;general have often raised concerns on how effectively they can do their job on the basis of how practically they have been funded and allowed to operate. We are trying to build on what has been a fairly extensive development of the role of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General over the years to try to put those questions very much in the open so that there can be no real accusation of any partisan approach. Although that has been the case in the past with the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, this report certainly gives us an opportunity to make things not only a matter of what actually is but what is seen to be.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the appointment of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, the committee recommended a 10&amp;hyphen;year fixed term. I believe that such a term may be a little too long, but I support the rationale and the reasoning for that recommendation. By and large, it is not a bad time. The intention is to ensure that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General cannot be seen to angle for a further term or put under any pressure on that basis by being made ineligible for reappointment and for any appointment within the Commonwealth Public Service for a further three years after they have sought to become Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee also looked at a retirement age of 65 for the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General—which I think is commonsense—and tying remuneration to senior levels in the Australian Public Service. All these recommendations are designed to try to say, in layman's terms, the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General is a very important part of the process of government in this country and plays a crucial role as a watchdog and as an
         <break page="5177" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        <para first-indent="16">
         This position not only should be independent and properly resourced, and seen to be significant, but it also has to be seen to be those things. That symbolism is crucial because as we look to the future and to the role of government evolving and altering over time, and we look at the role that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General will continue to play in years to come, issues like performance audits of GBEs and the wider role taken by the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General will be seen to be a crucial part of that watchdog role and a crucial part of ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It will be a crucial role in ensuring that people have reason to believe that their tax dollars are used effectively and the operation of government in this country is done effectively and in a way that is open for all to see. I commend the report to the House. I congratulate the staff of the committee for the work they have done and the committee members for working so well in a bipartisan way in my absence. I am back now, so I am not sure whether I can say the same about the next one.

          —by leave—This report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is the third in a series of reports with regard to trying to improve and increase the independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. The first report from the Public Accounts Committee was in 1989, report 296. I was fortunate enough to be part of the then Public Accounts Committee which put together report 331 in 1994. I am pleased to have been a member of the current Public Accounts Committee presenting this report No. 346,
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Guarding the independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General
          </emphasis>
          . I suppose what we have been trying to achieve in this report is encapsulated in a comment that the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the then Leader of the Opposition, made in June 1995 in his speech `The role of government: A modern Liberal approach' when he said:
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We will establish a completely independent Auditor&amp;hyphen;General so that a fearless and authoritative
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the Executive . . .
         </break>
        </para>
        <para>
         That is exactly what the committee has attempted to achieve in the recommendations encapsulated in this report. I will briefly go through the key recommendations which do that. Let us bear in mind that not only do we have to have the framework for independence but we have to have the appearance—and the symbolism, as the previous speaker said—of independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In recommendation 1 the committee recommends that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General be known by the title Independent Officer of the Parliament, the parliament being separate from the executive and being the representative of the people of Australia. So he will be an independent officer serving the people of Australia and a watchdog over the activities of the executive government. That is the nominal symbolism of the independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. To underpin that we saw the necessity to move the responsibility for the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. So recommendation 4 states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and the Australian National Audit Office should be the portfolio responsibility of the Prime Minister.
        </para>
        <para>
         So when dealing with appropriations and budgetary matters the Prime Minister, rather than the Minister for Finance, is the spokesman in that regard. In recommendation 6 we have recommended that the audit committee—we have also recommended that the JCPA be the audit committee—should examine the budget estimates of the ANAO and the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and make recommendations to the parliament and the Prime Minister for the appropriations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there is a circuit&amp;hyphen;breaker in the system where the people of Australia, through the representatives of the JCPA/audit committee in this parliament, are scrutinising the budget that is being put forward by the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and the ANAO for approval by the executive, to be included in the budget. So the people, through the representatives in this chamber on the audit committee, have a say in the budget. That is one of the key concerns
         <break page="5178" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that has been raised in the past in the previous two reports.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In recommendation 7 we say that the appropriations for the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and the ANAO should appear as a separate schedule in the budget papers, not hidden away under the Department of Finance. We are not making any aspersions that in the past the Department of Finance may have tried to intimidate or manipulate, in a financial way, the activities of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, but this gives the appearance that they will not and cannot. So in that process the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and the Australian National Audit Office will put together their budget for an upcoming year and present it to the audit committee. The audit committee will then recommend that to the parliament and to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will then deal with that and speak on that, I would imagine, in cabinet. Then that will appear in the budget papers as a separate line item for all to see.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All those measures underpin what we are trying to do in elevating not only the reality but the perception of independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. Lastly, and most importantly, the other recommendation I wanted to highlight is recommendation No. 14, which states:

        <para font-size="-=2">

         As one of the previous speakers said, although they are separate corporate entities, they are still owned by the Commonwealth and thus by the taxpayers of Australia. The taxpayers of Australia are the shareholders in those corporations. They deserve to have the ability, through their Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, to see how their investment is performing. That is also a very important recommendation.

         —I am delighted to have this chance to endorse the 1996 Commonwealth budget and I congratulate the Howard&amp;hyphen;Costello&amp;hyphen;Fischer government for tackling the very serious economic problems that we faced. Australia could not live on bankcard forever. I am disappointed that some members opposite have taken the occasion of this budget to try to reopen the class war—a class war which ended in Australia some time in the 1960s when all of us decided that we belong to the middle class.

        Earlier this week in my electorate corporate rights and environmental concerns came into head&amp;hyphen;on collision. Optus commenced its cable rollout in the municipality of Manly and many of my constituents feel that they are now threatened with a form of technological home invasion. The reason for this is the former government's telecommunications regime, which put telecommunications carriers in effect above the law. You and I cannot put a flagpole in our backyard without getting council permission first, yet these carriers can do virtually what they like. They can put a 30&amp;hyphen;metre&amp;hyphen;high phone tower virtually wherever they want.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In November 1994, the coalition tried to disallow the previous government's telecommunications national code in the Senate. We wanted a veto over some of these forms of infrastructure within a certain distance of residential homes and we wanted councils to have more power over the carriers. That is what we tried to do, but unfortunately the then government struck a compromise deal with the Democrats, a compromise which turned out to be just window&amp;hyphen;dressing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to stress that I am not here to blame Optus for what is happening; I am here to blame the previous government's system of rules. I commend the new Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, for his draft telecommunications national code, which gives councils significantly more say over infrastructure. It enables local councils
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         to implement locality planning—guidelines to permit or to prohibit this kind of infrastructure within their council areas. It also provides for appeals to Austel in the event of disagreement between councils and carriers.

        This is a very important step in the right direction and the Local Government Association is quite wrong to say that the draft code tabled by Senator Alston is going backwards. It is a very significant step in the right direction.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Unfortunately, it may now be too late to stop the Optus rollout. Perhaps we are in a situation a little bit like the words of Macbeth: `I am in blood steeped so far that returning were as tedious as to go o'er.' Nevertheless, it is vitally important that we have better regulation of the rollout so we ensure that cables cannot be rolled out in areas of extreme environmental sensitivity. It is very important that we have a national plan to ensure that, sooner or later, all the overhead infrastructure goes underground. If that does not happen, we will find the garden suburbs of the beautiful cities of our country looking like Chicago in the 19th century. The information superhighway will become a dead end of poles and wires, as Optus is followed by Telstra and various other entrants into the telecommunications market in stringing ever greater numbers of cables on poles that are already groaning under the weight.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is my understanding that the minister is looking into the possibility of a national burial fund for overhead infrastructure and that he is considering bringing the various parties to this issue together to see whether a sensible compromise can be hammered out. I strongly support those efforts and they cannot happen a moment too soon for the people in my electorate.

         Turning now to the North Head ocean outfall, many improvements have been made to this over the years. The Greiner government, with the support of the then member for Manly, David Hay, extended the outfall. It is now a deep ocean outfall. The Fahey government, with the support and indeed the encouragement of the now member for Manly, Peter Macdonald, ended incineration at the North Head site. Now all the treatment takes place in a sealed chamber. These are very signifi cant improvements to the treatment of waste matter at North Head, but it is not enough.

        It is very important that we reduce health costs to the general community. I cite that old adage that prevention is better than cure.

         —With the time being shortened, I would like to make a few brief comments on the budget and on some pre&amp;hyphen;budget initiatives taken by the government. For too long Australian families, especially families in the middle and lower income earning brackets of the Australian population, have been neglected.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have been looking through press clippings of the last three years of the previous government. It is interesting to see just how badly the press accepted the three budgets prior to this current one. I think Laura Tingle's article on the 1995 budget sums it up—`Broken promises pave the way to poll'. That was her headline. I suppose it encapsulated what had been going on over the previous three years—a lot of smoke and mirror tricks, a lot of giving with one hand and taking away with the other.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I for one very readily welcome the family tax initiative because I think for the first time in many years it starts to put cash back into the pockets of the average Australian battler. Someone with, say, three dependent children who is earning less than $76,000 a year will get $23.10 a fortnight more. If that same family is earning less than $71,000 and has a child under five years it would attract another $19.20 or, if you like, $42.30. If you go up to four children in a similar circumstance, it is $50. Although that may not be big money by today's standards, I think it is a vast improvement on what families have had to suffer over recent years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What has happened to families has been insidious. The excise on petrol crept up slowly, even after Labor modified its infamous attempt to impose a 5c and a 7c increase at the beginning of its term. Even so, it increased it later not only by the CPI factor but also by increased excise of small amounts during those years. In addition, sales tax was
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         delivered in two tranches—or, if you like to add cars to that, in three tranches—taking sales tax in what was the 10 per cent bracket to 11 per cent and then 12 per cent, in the 20 per cent bracket to 21 per cent and 22 per cent, and in the 30 per cent bracket to 31 per cent and 32 per cent. Then, of course, cars suffered another five per cent penalty on top of that after it had been promised that that would not happen in the foreseeable future.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is against that background that we deliver this valuable family tax initiative to low and middle income earners. As was pointed out by Ross Gittens in one of his articles, although the Keating government did deliver some tax concessions, it tended to be in the upper bracket of middle&amp;hyphen;class Australia and it neglected the people who really needed that help.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other thing that I commend heartily is the health insurance rebate. To have had Australia's health insurance profile reduced from 61 per cent or 62 per cent when Labor came to office to 32 per cent of the population is not only an insult to those people who want to be privately insured and take responsibility for their own health care but also a tremendous burden on the public hospital system. Having spent 15 years on a hospital board, I know just what those strains are and what state governments have to grapple with.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no private facility in my own electorate of Gladstone. I think Gladstone would benefit from a private hospital. In a provincial city, unless you have a private hospital alongside a public hospital, you get to a point where there is not sufficient weightage to attract specialists. One of two things happen: they either come to town and work in the public system and generally get worked to death and give it away because they cannot get relief, cannot get conferences and work excessively long hours, including weekends, or, alternatively, they do not get enough operating time and cannot sustain themselves.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When there is a private hospital you can generally work an arrangement: a mixture of sessional work at the public hospital, operating work at the private hospital and then the specialists' surgery facilities—all of which
        <break page="5183" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         create a package that keeps specialists in provincial cities. Health insurance rebates are very important to mention because if there are not enough people in provincial cities to support the private hospital then it is not going to happen. I commend the government for introducing the rebate: $125 for single people earning less than $50,000, $250 for couples and $450 for families.

        I want to talk about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Labor Party has distorted this immeasurably in the various debates we have had on this issue in the parliament over recent weeks. I have done an analysis of pharmaceutical benefits, going right back to 1960 when the co&amp;hyphen;payment was 50c. It is very interesting to note that the co&amp;hyphen;payment for the broad mass of the population since Labor came to power increased from $4 to $16.80—over 400 per cent. It crept up slowly over all that time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To come out now and become pious and preach to the coalition government because it has increased the co&amp;hyphen;payment to $20 is utter nonsense. If you look at the cost of pharmaceuticals during the same period, you will see that it is quite staggering. For example, the cost from 1992 to 1996 increased from $1.13 billion to $2.20 billion. It nearly doubled in that time. Is it any wonder there is a need for a co&amp;hyphen;payment? I do not mind the fact that Labor increased the co&amp;hyphen;payment if it did so in good faith. For example, on one occasion, between July 1985 and November 1986, it jumped up by $6—from $5 to $11. That was a fairly big jump, but nothing like the one we have put in place.

        We have left the safety net at $600. All that means is that someone who is on constant medication gets to that figure two prescriptions earlier than they would have otherwise got there. In other words, they might pay only an extra $2.80 on their prescriptions, but if they are unfortunate enough to be on constant medication they will not be disadvantaged. The safety net still cuts in at $600. The only difference is that they reach that two prescriptions earlier. That is a point the Labor Party have missed, and it shows that they have been manipulating this debate.

         Another interesting thing about the safety net that they have preached to us so much about is that between 1 January 1991 and 1 January 1996—five years—the safety net has increased from $300 to $600. So this caring Labor Party was saying to those people on constant medication, `Hey, you guys, you've got to be twice as sick as you were five years ago to fall into the safety net.' I think that is another point that has been missed in this whole debate.

         I want to finish on a matter that is perhaps not very popular in some parts of the country but where I think the government took the right policy decision—the closing down of REDOs. I spent 20 years in regional development and I never saw a worse scheme and I have never seen a better policy decision than to close those down. Those REDOs were excessively bureaucratic. They fostered a cargo cult mentality. They were generally not strategic in their planning. They were a sinecure for friends of the government on numerous committees. They had no sense of local ownership. They were derived from maps concocted in Canberra with no regard for local nuances. Worst of all, they were excessively expensive to run.

         I can remember that when the meeting to set up the REDO was held in my area I attended it. It was an interesting meeting. The promise was made, and it was also recommended by the interim chairman, that they should not become bureaucratic structures but that they should become umbrella organisations that would coordinate the work of the existing state based development boards. Everyone agreed to that; yet, within 12 months, we had these grants of $200,000 going out to run these REDOs.

         Generally, if you take the $150 million for that program, divide it by 41 regions in Australia, then take off a third for administration—which is absolutely abominable—then divide it by the number of years, there was not much there. It was another smoke and mirrors job. That is with the exception of those regions that got in fairly early and got a $2 million weir, or something like that. That is why I say `cargo cult mentality'; I think that in the ordinary course of events many of

         What made it even worse is that after these $200,000 grants went into the regions—that was about the average—in some instances the department then put officers out in the country to supervise the REDOs and, presumably, the spending of the $200,000. It was like a comedy circus. I have always said that, if the Commonwealth is going to participate in regional development, that sort of money should be aimed at a strategic level and given to enhance the existing development board's ability in the fields of trade, planning and industrial promotion. That could have been achieved at a third of the amount that Labor proposed by enhancing the original state based development boards; for example, by providing them with development officers, planning officers or researchers, so that they could do the work.

         The beauty of those development boards is that they reflect the local community. They have local ownership, with 300, 400 or 500 members. They are representative of local government of the area. They are not political appointments. They have state government representatives on them. They have a sense of ownership. They are not wasteful with their expenditure. Many of them combine tourism and industry promotion together, so the government dollar is driven further.

         I have had a fair go on this matter. I have been asked to shorten my presentation. I wanted to put those things before the parliament at the time of this budget. I commend the government especially for its family initiatives. I am comfortable with its plans for health, child care and nursing homes—matters that I am quite happy to address at a later date. I would commend the government for the courage to put this REDO situation to bed and hopefully, as we move towards the end of this term, we can look at something better for regional Australia which will better reflect the aspirations of those areas that need development and need it desperately.

        It certainly says something about the comprehensive nature of the election on 2 March this year that the response of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to the budget barely made a ripple. It barely rated a mention. Indeed, media interest and, more profoundly, public interest have been much more apparent with respect to the maiden speech made to the budget by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).

Prior to the budget my office records revealed some degree of anxiety. These fears were whipped up by an opposition that finds its main expertise lies in false propaganda or disinformation and fuelling the fears of an anxious public. But a strange thing happened after the delivery of the budget. The phones went relatively quiet. Not only that, but in going around my electorate of Cook, I was gratified by the number of people who congratulated me personally on the budget.

        I will outline some of the things that have been happening on this issue, particularly in light of some comments made by my friend and colleague, the newly elected Mayor of the Sutherland Shire, Councillor Kevin Schreiber, who is very concerned about the impact of trialling the flight paths on the residents of Kurnell. On 20 March 1996 the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) directed Airservices Australia to undertake a review of Sydney air space and report on the long-term operations by 16 December 1996. As part of this review I am ensuring that the proposals put forward by Kurnell residents are comprehensively evaluated. On 29 March I wrote to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development asking for an evaluation of proposals advanced by Kurnell and Cronulla residents.

In June I met with representatives of Airservices Australia and Michael Day, author of a plan being promoted by the Kurnell flight path action group, which includes consideration of curved flight path approaches through the heads of Botany Bay. Today I had to leave a meeting with Michael Day and representatives of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and also a representative of the ministry of transport to come to the chamber to make this speech.

        In addition to my nominee on the Sydney Airport Community Forum, I have asked Peter Mattson of the North Cronulla Precinct Committee to serve as my nominated alternative to the committee. At the behest of Peter and the North Cronulla Precinct Committee, I have taken up the proposal that aircraft departing to the south should turn out to sea over Bate Bay—that is, after taking a jink to avoid the village of Kurnell—and thereby avoid hugging the Cronulla Peninsula coastline. This proposal had been talked about but had not been properly addressed prior to our government coming into office.

        The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has, at my instigation, examined this proposal and approved it in principle.

CASA advises that this option would take aircraft approximately three kilometres further off the coast adjacent to Bundeena than is currently the case. This would be very much welcomed by the people living on the Cronulla Peninsula. Implementation of this proposal involves amendment to regulations, and I therefore urge the minister to implement these changes as soon as possible.

        I have received some complaints from residents of Sylvania who are experiencing an increase in aircraft activity due to the opening of the east-west runway and the propensity of pilots heading towards Melbourne to turn left and head south at the earliest opportunity. The recent announcement by the minister that he has directed Airservices Australia to implement, on a trial basis, take-offs to the north from the third runway will considerably alleviate this traffic as the Melbourne traffic will take off to the north, do a turn east out to sea and then proceed south over water. This would occur, generally, with onshore north&amp;hyphen;easterly winds—the prevailing wind pattern in the summer months. In addition, this procedure would reduce landings over

        I have also received a lot of complaints from residents of Grays Point. They are being affected by the Melbourne traffic heading south. They are also being affected by some planes that are curving to approach and are doing a loop through the Sutherland shire, going over the top of Grays Point and then coming in to land. I am very confident that the overview that is occurring at this time will do a great deal to assist in removing this type of flight path from residential areas and place them over areas more appropriate to pass over. It is a matter of making sure that all of these concerns, complaints and alternative proposals are put to the inquiry and are properly evaluated, and then we can look forward to a comprehensive plan that will be produced in December.

        Another proposal that has recently emerged but seems to have sunk very quickly—I hope it has—was the idea of constructing another runway at the end of the two existing runways protruding into Botany Bay. That additional runway proposal would point out towards the Heads. I would like to put squarely on the record my opposition to that proposal. It is unfortunate really that we did build runways into Botany Bay. It seems strange that in a country as vast as ours—we are not like Holland or Hong Kong—we had to fill in bays. That is something we could have done without.

Those funds could be very useful in implementing proposals that have been already looked at and evaluated with respect to looking after this particularly important wetland. The idea of putting another runway in the middle of Botany Bay would, on environmental grounds, be catastrophic.

        I mentioned earlier that I would like to say a few words about the brouhaha that arose following the maiden speech of the member of Oxley (Ms Hanson). I was very concerned to read about the statements. I think it is an indication of the desperation of the opposition when you get statements from people who are stalwarts of the trade union movement like state Labor secretary, John Della Bosca. I think he pulled something right from the bottom drawer when he was quoted in the papers as saying, `John Howard acts like a racist and profits by racism.' Frankly, that sort of comment is about as low as you can get. It is a despicable comment to make about a Prime Minister who is an honourable man, and anybody who knows him or has had anything to do with him knows that only too well.

        Secondly, the government is duty&amp;hyphen;bound, in my view, to take note of the issues raised by the honourable member for Oxley. This should be the case with matters raised by any honourable member of this House, including members of the opposition. I was particularly impressed by the answer given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier this week in response to a question by the Leader of the Opposition. I noted two particular points that he made. He said that there should be `robust debate in this country about the size of our immigration policy' and that `people who exercise free speech have an obligation to do so in a sensitive and caring fashion'. I think that sums it up and says it all.

I do not really believe it to be correct. I have always taken the view that the greatest resource of any country lies in its population, the fruits of its toil and the talents of an educated citizenship. This issue does need to  be debated.

One of the worst legacies of the Labor years is the dangerously low levels of national savings that have come with this. It is an ominous sign that, apart from the war years and the Great Depression, under the previous government savings reached their lowest level this century. From 1973 to 1983 Australia's national savings rate was 22 per cent of our gross domestic product. Despite its rising to 22.4 per cent in 1988&amp;hyphen;89, the recession that we had to have under Labor inflicted enormous damage on the savings rate and the figure had fallen to 16.8 per cent by 1994&amp;hyphen;95.

         As a result, our national savings are not only 5.6 per cent of GDP below the pre&amp;hyphen;recession figure of 1988&amp;hyphen;89 but also they have dropped below the lowest point of the 1982&amp;hyphen;83 recession. As the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, said in November last year:

        </para>

         Clearly, as the former governor put it so succinctly, this is a very serious problem and it is something that the present government has inherited from the failed Labor government.

          One of the great concerns is that, when we look at both public and voluntary household savings, we find they are in fact in a precari ous state. More concerning is the fact that they have declined when we compare them with those of our Asian neighbours. In fact, if we look at the achievements of many Asian and OECD countries, we find quite clearly that saving both funds investment and, more importantly, generates further investment—something that we clearly need to help solve some of our unemployment problems and some of the many other related problems.

         If we look at the household saving rates as a percentage of disposable household income, we find that in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 Australia was down to just 2.5 per cent. This compares with Japan at 13.4 per cent, nearly six times; Germany at 11.6 per cent; and even the United States at 4.7 per cent. If we consider it, it is through a lack of adequate savings that we have been forced to look offshore for financial resources. In other words, we have had to rely on the savings of foreigners and this has been one of the instrumental causes of the rise in our national debt. So what we have seen is that from the time that Labor came into power in 1983 until earlier this year Australia's foreign debt went from $23,000 million to a staggering $180,000 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But it is even more concerning when you look at what has happened to public savings: Labor actually reduced national savings by 3.1 per cent of the gross domestic product. Not only that, when we look at the cumulative figures in recent years, we see that Commonwealth debt has gone from $55 billion to over $97 billion because of the cumulative budget deficit in recent years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the other related areas that is of equal concern is the plight of household savings. Once again, when we look at the figures under the Labor government, we see some very telling figures. In the March quarter of 1983, household savings were around 7.6 per cent of household disposable income. By September 1995, this figure had slumped to 3.6 per cent—less than half. If you look at the liabilities of interest bearing assets of the household savings, you find it even more alarming. In fact, the household sector actually went into deficit and is a net payer of interest.
        </para>
        <break page="5196" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Whatever way you look at it, the Labor government holds a number of dubious records. The first is that household savings are at near record low levels, while household debt as a percentage of disposable income is at record high levels. Why did this happen under Labor? There are a number of reasons. Firstly, our level of income tax was high compared with that of many of our competitors. Secondly, we did not experience the growth in incomes necessary to allow most people to save. Thirdly, our savings were taxed at the full marginal income rate on real and also on nominal gains.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Labor did nothing to provide the incentives necessary to encourage voluntary savings by Australian families. This level of tax which so many Australians suffered from particularly affected those who wished to save. It affected their interest income. What was bizarre about this was that it affected blue&amp;hyphen;collar workers more than anyone else. They were the hardest hit by this attack on household savings.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What are the consequences of this? With our foreign debt already high, foreign financiers are building premiums into the terms on which they are prepared to lend us money. In other words, like an overgeared corporation, we are gradually becoming more exposed to the risk of external shocks. A major future shock could push Australia into a debt spiral which we could only escape from by making extremely harsh and protracted adjustments.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are other indicators of just how irresponsible this was. For example, our foreign credit rating was downgraded—not once, but twice. Our foreign currency credit rating was downgraded by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's, first in 1986 and again in 1989. That is some record. This is what the new government has inherited. This is the challenge that this budget takes up. This budget will be hailed as a success because it will turn around the problem of national savings and, just as importantly, it will encourage an increase in household savings and, in particular, voluntary savings.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I could go on at some length about the risks caused by low savings levels. One of the immediate results is that, for many Australians, interest rates are significantly higher

          More seriously, if it is not addressed, there is a risk of loss of sovereignty as we become more and more dependent on the mercy of foreign lenders and have less and less of a say in the way we conduct our economy. It always seemed ironic to me when the former Prime Minister talked about increasing the independence of this country when it was through his actions, both as Treasurer and as Prime Minister, that we became increasingly dependent on foreigners—not more independent.

          This budget will have some very positive effects for people in the country, particularly those in my electorate of Wannon. One of the real concerns in my electorate has been the effect Labor's economic mismanagement has had on the farming sector, especially those who have had to borrow to remain viable. One of the major concerns is the level of debt in the farming sector that Labor more than doubled. It is now something like $18,000 million. The higher interest rate premium that I was talking about earlier has had a direct negative effect on those who have been put in that unfortunate position.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What the government is doing in what I hail as the excellent budget of the Treasurer is to turn around some of these negative aspects of economic mismanagement. That is why I believe that not only are all Australians very positive about this but also the opposition ought to be positive because they know in their hearts, underneath it all, that it has taken this change of government to really start to turn the nation around, to really start to give the next generation some real hope and to stop some of the nonsenses that were going on with the smoke and mirrors that were being employed by some of the Labor treasurers.

          I come back to this point about savings. It is just so important that if we are going to build a sound, secure future base then clearly it has to be by encouraging individuals to increase their level of savings and, of course,
          <break page="5197" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          From those two perspectives I believe that we face some very serious decisions. We have taken the first of these, although there will obviously have to be more down the way. The level of savings is something that should be of great concern nationally. Clearly, this government has started to do something about it. It is something that all Australians should be deeply concerned about because without this action the country could face some very serious problems in the years to come.

        This bill will give legislative effect to a 1996 government budget decision to discontinue the payment of the untargeted operational subsidy to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997.

        The repeal of section 11 from the Child Care Act addresses the inequities in government funding between families using private long day care centres and community centres. The removal of operational subsidy will place community based long day care centres and private long day care centres on an equal footing. It will also encourage greater efficiencies. Operational subsidy will continue to be made available for family day care, occasional care, outside school hours care, multifunctional children's services and multifunctional Aboriginal children's services. These services are crucial to meeting the diverse child&amp;hyphen;care needs of Australian families.

          <para in-line="1">
           —by leave—The Public Works Committee is a unique committee. It is unique in that, whereas other parliamentary committees engineer particular referrals that are of interest to the strategies of that committee, the Public Works Committee only has the referrals that are brought to it by other departments. It does not engineer its workload; its workload is dictated by departments that undertake capital works of in excess of $6 million. It is therefore worth noting that when the work on Christmas Island was referred to the Public Works Committee it came not at the committee's behest but at the behest of the appropriate department.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I make that point because there were some among my parliamentary colleagues who presumed that sending the Joint Committee on Public Works to Christmas Island meant sending them to an idyllic spot. It is true. I am sure that, as a Western Australian, the shadow minister at the table is more familiar than most with just how idyllic a spot Christmas Island is. It is true that Christmas Island is a tropical island. It is true that Christmas Island is a slowly growing tourist attraction.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, it is also true to say—and the parliament needs to recognise this—that Christmas Island is a huge phosphate mine. The scars from the mining have now largely been overgrown by tropical growth. The phosphate mine no longer has first&amp;hyphen;grade phosphate available, and so the Christmas Island community has, in recent times, faced some difficulty adjusting to life without the income from the phosphate mine.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I will outline the history of the island for the benefit of my parliamentary colleagues. Christmas Island as such first came into being in 1888 when the British acquired it. They recognised the worth of the phosphate and proceeded to mine it. In 1947, the Australian and New Zealand governments purchased the phosphate mining operation from the British government. That proceeded until 1987, when high&amp;hyphen;grade ore ceased to be available.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That could have been the end of Christmas Island, but two things have subsequently happened. Firstly, a casino was built which has attracted interest from all around the
          <break page="5199" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           globe, but principally from Indonesian and Malaysian players. Secondly, a new company was formed to process the low&amp;hyphen;grade ore that remained as a result of the high&amp;hyphen;grade ore processing that had already occurred.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As this is part of Australian territory, the Australian government of the day, I concede quite responsibly, recognised that they had a responsibility to maintain on Christmas Island the standards that exist on the Australian mainland. While the then government undertook a rebuilding program on the hospital and the school, and while airport facilities have been upgraded to meet demand for the casino, it is also fair to say that unemployment has not been a major problem on the island because of the growth of the casino and the reworking of the phosphate mine. In fact, it is below the unemployment levels existing on the mainland.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The island population numbers about 2,000 to 2,200 people, depending on how many visitors are there. Many of the community are of Malaysian descent because, when it was first in operation, the British phosphate mine attracted Malay employees. The population of Christmas Island lives principally in five areas. The Settlement is the major retailing area on the island. Adjoining it is the Kampong, which I will deal with in a few moments time. The other three areas are Poon Saan, Silver City and Drumsite.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The reason that the activities on the island were brought to the attention of the Joint Committee on Public Works was that in February 1995, a 30&amp;hyphen;tonne boulder collapsed near the Kampong area, posing a risk to human life in the area. The management of the island suggested that it would be responsible for the Commonwealth to minimise this risk by looking to some form of strategy to deal with it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Kampong, which was the area particularly threatened by the rock fall, is at sea level. It is a settlement which is overlooked by a steep cliff which rises 180 metres above the Kampong and which poses the rock fall risk. The danger to life and property posed by loose boulders from the cliff face has been known for some time, and numerous incidents
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           have been reported, the most recent of which, as I said, was in 1995.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A landslide risk assessment that was carried out by specialist consultants following the incident I have referred to highlighted the risk that was posed to the residents of the Kampong area. Advice from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department demonstrated that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to implement appropriate risk reduction strategies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While it is difficult to assess precisely what the risk is, the whole question of what should happen on Christmas Island in terms of reducing rock falls was a matter of assessing the probability of a particular disaster occurring. The areas of particular concern to the Commonwealth are two residential blocks known as block 408 and block 412. The consultant who, in the Golder report, assessed the risk, indicated that at block 408 he felt that the individual risk per annum of there being any fatality was one in 11,000 to one in 63,000, and one in 53,000 to one in 300,000 at block 412.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While they may seem like relatively low figures, the facts are that they still represent a higher risk than a number of activities that Australians would normally engage in. For that reason the Commonwealth felt an obligation to look at these rock fall reduction strategies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The consultant's report, which I have tabled, attaches the greatest risk of fatality to residents of these blocks. Under the Christmas Island redevelopment program the government has allocated nearly $2 million for the construction of rock fall barriers of a modern, sophisticated design, adjacent to these residential blocks. These barriers will stop the equivalent of a 10 tonne truck travelling at 50 kilometres per hour. Because of the need to proceed with the work before the forthcoming wet season, the committee agreed to the immediate construction of the barriers. This will reduce the level of risk substantially.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          <break page="5200" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
           The committee has also recommended that before this December, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories should have ready a rock fall risk management plan for Flying Fish Cove. The plan should identify events, document responses, assign respon sibilities amongst the various organisations, research, monitor and increase the community awareness of risks and dangers. Simulated exercises should be undertaken.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This reference was somewhat unusual in one respect: instead of a definitive proposal, DEST presented the committee with a range of strategies, five in all, which provide risk reduction measures, the construction of fences and barriers, and the provision of alternative accommodation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          All would involve expenditure by the Commonwealth. DEST was unwilling to identify a preferred strategy. The consultant who made the risk evaluations was therefore asked by the committee to make recommendations appropriate to the circumstances. Reliance on expert advice was seen by the committee as the most prudent course to follow.

          It was clear from community reactions that the most pressing need on Christmas Island is the availability of land for private development. The committee has made a number of recommendations designed to reduce risks from rock falls and to hasten the release of land. If implemented, they will substantially reduce the need for the Commonwealth to continue investing large sums in housing on the island.

          Finally, I should mention the Christmas Island Boat Club, which has premises in what is seen as a high risk area. The premises were subject to a potentially catastrophic event in 1972 involving several large boulders. The consultant has recommended that the premises be demolished. The committee has agreed to this but has also recommended that a new safer site be found for the club and that the construction costs for a new building be wholly or partially funded from the community benefit fund.

         —I started this speech yesterday and unfortunately it was interrupted because of other business. Returning to the topic today, I would like to point out what is happening in the community in terms of this budget and this government's approach to beneficiaries.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government puts forward with enormous energy and at great expense to the taxpayers a thesis that the budget cuts are only occurring in areas where they are deserved. In other words, the cuts affect people who are rorting schemes or rorting business welfare or affect people who are not observing the rules. The government claims the community benefit is being achieved by cutting certain areas. The implication is that those people who are affected by the cuts are themselves responsible. In other words, the ones who are being cut deserve to be cut and therefore they should not complain.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That sits very badly with the thesis of the government at election time about protecting those most in need of help and maintaining income for pensioners and the like. Those two objectives sit very badly. The fact is the people who are affected by these budget cuts are expressing the view that they are made to feel somehow it is their fault but they do not know quite why. They are upset and they are hurt and they are concerned. They do not know why they have been targeted or picked on for punishment. They were not aware they were offending. However, all the pundits cannot be wrong so therefore it must be their fault.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One day they will realise that it was not their fault, that the whole thing is a furphy and a concoction and a quite deceitful exercise. The fact is the government has lied. It lied during the election, it lied up to the budget and it has lied since the budget. The example I mentioned yesterday which best demonstrates that is the question of the average earning credits scheme. The second reading speech says the scheme is being wiped out because is it is too complicated and people do not understand it. That was the only reason put forward. What the minister did not say was that it is also saving $250 million from pensioner and beneficiaries payments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I quoted yesterday the example of people who take part-time work for a short period, like being a Santa Claus at Christmas. This is one of the things that brought this process into place, the fact that at some times of the year some retired people will work for a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          couple of weeks at Christmas time as a Santa Claus. In the past, before this process was available, they were likely to lose most if not all of their pension for that period and the net benefit of all that work was that they ended up almost no better off. But they liked doing that, they enjoyed the engagement, they enjoyed that experience.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The earnings credit scheme that allows you to earn $1,000 averaged over a year was a great benefit to those people. Sure, it was complicated. Sure, it cost to administer it. But the point was it was to encourage people in our community to feel that they could be judged on earnings like they could on tax. The fact was that they earned, they paid tax over a whole year, but if they were a pensioner or beneficiary they were effectively punished week by week by week. Even if for the whole year they averaged $30 a week, which would be below the cut&amp;hyphen;off point for pension cut&amp;hyphen;out, they could still lose their pension for two weeks if in fact they earned that $1,000 in a fortnight.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact that it is going to save a quarter of a billion dollars is indicative that this was not about the complexity and it was not about the difficulty of administration, it was always about the saving. Yet, the government has been so dishonest with what it has put forward. The fact is that most people who are affected by it do not know about it yet. When they finally find out they are going to be very angry and they will feel very cheated. It affects something like 120,000, which is no small number. As for it being too hard to access and too complicated, the fact that it is saving so much indicates that a lot of people have understood it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to go through just nine measures in this legislation that are affected. The under-18&amp;hyphen;years change to jobsearch means a saving of $29 million. The activity test on beneficiaries means $377 million savings; the earnings credit scheme that I have just mentioned is a saving of $259 million. The employment education entry payment, to help people back into employment, saves $59 million. The backdating of child disability allowance—that is a nice little exercise—amounts to $6 million. The lump sum super payment saves
         <break page="5202" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          $58 million, deeming for pensioners with the first $2,000 or $4,000, $40 million. The debt recovery—this is wonderful, this is the one where it says that social security can never be wrong—brings in $372 million and the advance system of $79 million. That comes to $1.279 billion.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One point three billion dollars will be ripped off pensioners and beneficiaries. These are the people that this government was supposed to protect. If that is protection, I would hate to see if they got punished. That is not taking into account, also, the cuts to Working Nation and all the other things that have been done. But it still leaves $1.3 billion in nine measures. There are other measures involved as well in here, but those nine are enough to talk about: $1.279 billion out of the pockets of pensioners and beneficiaries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The savings will not be achieved because a lot of people will not do those things. A lot of the pensioners will not work as Santa Claus any more and that will be a tragedy. But they will not do it because they would lose their pension for a week or a fortnight and create all the hassles involved. If the government thinks the earnings credit scheme is complicated, I can tell you it is nowhere near as complicated as trying to explain to a pensioner that if they work for a fortnight at $500 a week they will lose most of their pension and have to pay back that pension if they do not put in a form.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is much more complicated. It will cost much more to administer and it will mean people, once they know about it, simply will not do it. So they will not get the savings anyhow. All they will do is drive people out of the system. The point is that these savings are illusory because they are only available if these systems are in place. Take them away and the people will not do it. Mind you, with some of them they will have no choice, like the deeming one. That is the one where the first $2,000 for a single pension or $4,000 for a married couple of money in the bank will be charged at full deeming rates.

         The child disability allowance, being paid backwards for a year, for the families with children with disabilities who receive that allowance, has been a major thing. For many
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          families the costs and the burdens and the problems of having a child with a disability do not really formulate. It often takes six or nine months before they actually get it diagnosed properly. To cut that out at the cost of saving a measly $6 million sends a very nasty message to all people in the community with disabilities.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This government is against people with disabilities. That measure of support to those families with special problems had been a fundamentally important one. By ripping it back, ripping it away and putting it backwards for only three months is a really gross measure. It is a mean, nasty exercise aimed at those people who are the most worse off. There is an argument for saying we should go back to birth, not to 12 months ago, because those families have borne the burden by themselves in many cases for one or two or three or four years, in many cases even longer, not knowing what is causing it and feeling responsible themselves.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The child disability allowance has been a minor way in which the community has been able to help that family look after their young. So, as I said, this government's measures are very nasty. Two that go hand in glove are the new activities test on what constitutes suitable employment and the debt recovery process, which is amongst the last of the amendments. Between them, they come to about $700 million, more than half the $1.2 billion I spoke of.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is in future deemed to be suitable employment is going to be very interesting. For example, if a fitter and turner turns down a job as a labourer, it will probably be deemed that he is not entitled to social security. On the other hand, once he has worked as a labourer and he applies for his next job as a fitter and turner, his deskilling will have serious consequences. Not many employers will take on a skilled tradesman who has been working outside his trade in a lower skilled area. Once a person does that, he diminishes his employability. Under this new system, that will be the case.

         I and many of my colleagues in this House, and perhaps even the Senate, are getting an increasing number of people coming to our

          offices with worries and concerns about how these things will work and what is happening in our CES and DSS offices. The number of staff has been reduced, so there are fewer people dealing with cases on a face&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;face basis and making judgments. The skill levels are lower because a lot of the people who left were the most experienced in the department.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The uncertainty amongst the staff is enormous. They do not quite know how to interpret it, so they are going to the maximum in case they are wrong. In other words, people are being treated at the harsh end of the scale because the departmental officers do not want to be seen not to be applying the laws. These amendments are being quoted to people right now. As recently as yesterday afternoon, I was advised of a case where the department quoted the need to take into account now the amendments which are coming into operation in January.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If Social Security staff make a mistake and it is their unforced error, not the person's, then what these amendments say is that the person will still pay. So the government's approach is: reduce staff, deskill the work force in the Department of Social Security and the CES and then, if they make a mistake, the beneficiary pays. In other words, Social Security and CES can do no wrong. That is a saving of $370 million—off whom? It is off beneficiaries, off unemployed people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These amendments target the worst off in our community—the beneficiaries and the pensioners. They rip out $1.2 billion from their current incomes. This is a government that is supposed to govern for all. Try and tell that to the people who are affected by these amendments. They do not feel included at all. They feel victimised and targeted. They are also told it is their own fault. These amendments should be voted down. They are abysmal and an insult to the parliament.

        This afternoon, I am going to give some good news in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill. Tuesday, 1 October 1996 was the International Day for the Elderly.

        It was a day to honour not only elderly Australian citizens, but also a day to recognise the dedication and work of Townsville's and Thuringowa's aged care workers.

        We have all heard the statement, many times before, that Australia has an increasing ageing population. It was as true 10 years ago as it is today, and every year pressure builds on our aged care system to better cater for, care for and accommodate our elderly Australian citizens. One group of people that I had the opportunity to thank publicly on October 1 were the home carers. While aged care workers do get recognition in society from time to time, though nowhere near enough, home carers receive practically no praise or thanks at all.

         ing some time in Townsville recently. During the time the minister was in Townsville, she was able to meet with representatives from aged care, child care and emergency care services.

        As far as I am concerned, home carers are Australia's unsung heroes. Without them, the pressure on our aged care nursing homes, hostels and hospitals would simply be too great. I fully agree with the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, when, just under a month ago, she said during question time that the care these people provide could hardly be duplicated by institutional care in this country and that, even if it could be matched, the cost to the nation would be enormous. The quality of the care could never match that of the people who are giving care to those they love.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition government is committed to recognising the invaluable role home carers play in our society. Our commitments to them are partly reflected in schedules one and two of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. While changing references in certain acts from carer pension to carer payment may be viewed by some as a cosmetic change, it is an important change, nonetheless. The word `pension' carries certain connotations, and the reality is that many people are too proud to have their names attached to those particular connotations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Home carers often have to sacrifice a lot to provide the loving services that they do. Anything we do as a government should not make the decision to stay at home and care for a loved one any harder than it already is. If part of that means replacing the word `pension' with the word `payment', then that is a change that should have occurred a long, long time ago.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government will also extend, from 10 to 20 hours a week, the hours a carer may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training, without affecting their qualification for the carer payment. Home care more often than not means close to full time care
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and people do, unavoidably, lose some touch with other aspects of their lives. The changes contained in schedule 2 of this bill will also help to ensure carers lose as little touch with their employment, study or other activities as possible.

       </para>

        Further, schedule 2 will increase by 10 days the number of days a carer may temporarily cease to act in caring in a year, without affecting their qualification for the carer payment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        These are basic changes which the previous government could have implemented any time in the last 13 years, with minimal cost. The fact that they did not is disgraceful. These points are very significant and welcome extensions of the bill. They are very welcome changes, not only in my electorate, but in every electorate throughout Australia. No doubt the constituents of Lindsay also recognise their significance. These changes give carers greater flexibility in their arrangements and will make the decision to care for a loved one at home easier to make. These changes will prove particularly welcome in the rural and regional areas of Australia, where access to medical, nursing and respite facilities is restricted.

        Carers need to be able to take a break every once in a while from the pressures and the strains, particularly the emotional strains of the work they do. This government is directly addressing this need. The coalition is providing $36.7 million over four years for a national respite for carers program. This program will see carer resource centres established throughout the country. About $31 million has also been allocated to support children with high levels of needs in care, such as children with disabilities.

        This bill also recognises the valuable role of voluntary work in society. Schedule 4 removes restrictions on the amount of full&amp;hyphen;time voluntary work for unemployed people aged 50 and over and increases the allowable amounts of voluntary work for customers of all ages. Voluntary work often paves the way to real employment. While that is especially true for our younger Australians—one of my staff is a good example of that—it is also true for older people trying to get back into the work force.

        Schedule 4 provides a new means for the older unemployed to satisfy the activity test by undertaking approved full-time unpaid voluntary work for an approved organisation for an unlimited number of days per year, or by a combination of unpaid voluntary work with an approved organisation and suitable paid work for at least 40 hours in a fortnightly period. For people undertaking full&amp;hyphen;time voluntary work, only 32 hours per fortnight are required to satisfy the activity test.

        While there are areas this government is freeing up, we have also made an election commitment to improve and tighten DSS activity test and administrative breaches.

It is very sad that this should happen in this country.

        One problem brought to the attention of the Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce, when she visited Townsville was raised in the first meeting she had with representatives of Townsville's emergency care providers, the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the Community Emergency Support Centre and the Salvation Army. Townsville would have to be one of the most idyllic

Perhaps some of our visitors this afternoon might take that as a commercial for Townsville. However, Townsville's emergency care providers say our weather also brings a steady flow of unemployed or disadvantaged people who, according to the Society of St Vincent de Paul's administrator, Bernadine Breen, can often show up at the emergency centres or the DSS with only $10 in their pocket.

        It is a fact that people wishing for one reason or another to drop out of the employment market are attracted to centres offering a comfortable lifestyle. Byron Bay, for example, is a well known location. However, having people gravitate to certain centres does increase pressure on services provided by organisations such as Townsville's Community Emergency Support Centre. Maureen Hurst, the coordinator of Community Emergency Support Centre in Townsville, has told both myself and the minister that she could have to satisfy up to 120 people on any given day seeking assistance. In that respect, I was pleased that the minister was able to tell Townsville's emergency care providers that an additional $5 million has been provided by this government over the next four years to assist in this area. That additional $5 million is very welcome indeed.

        Social security should be there to provide those in our society who need assistance with a safety net. Unemployment benefits should be there to assist people during periods of unemployment. It should not be used as a substitute for employment itself.

        Schedule 5 of this bill will help ensure that only those who are genuinely unemployed and actively seeking to return to the work force will receive payment. No doubt some on the opposition bench will claim that these measures are coldly designed to remove the social security safety net and toss people off unemployment benefits. But, let us face it, Mr Deputy Speaker, people who actively look for work, whether they are successful or not, will have no problem in meeting the DSS guidelines for assistance.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, before I finish up I would like to speak briefly on another section of this bill. Just last week I took a call from a constituent wanting to know what the government was doing to assist widows. Schedule 12 of this bill provides measures to provide common payment arrangements for older women without recent work force experience who either are a dependent partner or who lost the support of a partner later in life.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I was able to tell my constituent that as from 20 March 1997 the widow allowance will be extended to women aged at least 50 years who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 40 years of age. This is a significant step forward in the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The widow allowance was introduced in January 1995 by the previous government to assist women who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 50 and who had no recent work force experience. While women will still have to be at least 50 before accessing the allowance, the lowering of the age of when a person becomes widowed, divorced or separated to 40, more realistically takes into consideration some of the employment and financial difficulties people face after losing a partner at such a stage in their life.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Schedule 12 will be of real benefit to widowed, separated or divorced women in my electorate of Herbert as it will be to older women throughout Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend this bill to the House.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. John Howard, Prime Minister, said he was pursuing a fair Australia, that he would protect the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our community. Most of all what the Prime Minister said was that he was going to be `for all of us'. But the reality of this bill shows that this was a very shallow pledge, that `all of us' excludes the aged, the young, the unemployed, migrants, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islander people, students and, of course, women. There are a number of significant issues in this bill, but I only want to touch on some of them here today.

         government and the way in which they are taking away the earnings credit scheme which is being abolished in this bill, the employment entry payment and the non&amp;hyphen;pensioners' education entry payment. All of these payments were introduced to in fact assist people into employment. The taking away of these payments is going to mean that people are going to be on unemployment benefits and are not going to be able to access employment in the same way that they were before.

        Another very serious change in this bill is the way in which they are changing the child disability allowance. These are the different items that I want to go through in this bill. What this government has tried to do is woo families with their family tax initiative, but as we start to add up the numbers and as families start to add up the numbers, they are going to see that the small benefits that the family tax initiative gives to families will be taken away with the other hand.

        There is no doubt that the family tax initiative will hardly—will not in very, very many cases, not in the majority of cases—offset the costs and the pain that families will face as a result of the rest of this government's measures.

        The first I personally knew about the decision of the bankruptcy authorities was when I turned on the television this morning for the early morning news. I have asked the Attorney-General to advise the government as to whether it is feasible to overturn the decision that was taken by the bankruptcy authorities. According to my advice, that decision was taken by the bankruptcy authorities in accordance with guidelines established by Michael Lavarch, the former Attorney-General. Those guidelines were adopted by the incoming government. The decision was taken, so I am advised, without prior reference to the government which, I guess, in the normal course of events, would be a natural thing to do in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act.

         —Can I simply say to the House and, through the House, to the Australian public that we will act if there is any earthly likelihood of recovering Christopher Skase's ill&amp;hyphen;gotten gains—and those ill&amp;hyphen;gotten gains must anger battling Australians who have to pay their taxes and have otherwise got to comply with the laws of Australia. I have to say that on an issue like this I can understand how ordinary battling Australians think the system is unfair. What Skase has done was aided and abetted by the Spanish judicial process not by the Australian judicial process. Having made that point—and with the approval of a number of people on the front bench of the Labor Party—I think it places some obligation on them also not to score some cheap political point out of it.

        Can I just say to the House that what Christopher Skase has been able to do represents an obscenity in the eyes of average Australians. It is a great disappointment to me, and I am sure to all Australians, irrespective of their politics, that the Spanish judicial process has let him go free. I have asked the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to examine whether it is appropriate to overturn the decision of the bankruptcy authorities. That decision was not, so I am told, taken as a result of any budget expenditure decisions. It was taken, according to the bankruptcy authorities, on their assessment of whether or not the committing of further resources would be a worthwhile investment of public funds.

        To put this in some perspective, this is still extraordinarily generous by international standards. In the United States, someone could expect to get six or seven psychiatric consultations in one year and then pay for the lot afterwards. In the recent Dutch budget, psychiatric consultations were limited to 15 per year, with the patient paying the total amount after that.

The Medicare schedule fee for a one&amp;hyphen;hour psychiatric consultation is $128.50 and only about one per cent of people seeing a psychiatrist—or 2,500 people a year—will have more than 50 consultations a year. These people constitute 16 per cent of all services. For people who do have more than 50 consultations a year, they cost an average of $10,750 each.

        This is not primarily a cost&amp;hyphen;cutting exercise—the money saved is small—but if I get one frequent complaint from general practitioners it is that they cannot get their patients in to see psychiatrists. There are some psychiatrists who see a very small number of people very frequently. Access to psychiatric services is a major concern and it is also a major concern that it is very difficult to get psychiatrists to work in Australia's public hospitals. If you look at the distribution of psychiatrists, the overwhelming majority of rural electorates have absolutely nobody in them who sees a psychiatrist more than 50 times a year.

In that regard, I would remind the House of the findings of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra that some 71 per cent of families in Australia, and not the wealthiest families, will benefit from the family tax initiatives initiated by the Prime Minister and the government in the budget due to cut in on 1 January 1997—another very positive dimension of the economy of Australia.

This study will begin in departments and agencies at the end of October.

        This whole of government approach to information technology has wide application in the Commonwealth. The government can no longer afford the luxury of, for example, more than 50 personnel and financial systems, nor can it afford more than a dozen data centres, many with excess capacity. I commend the Leader of the Opposition for his foresight in establishing the Office of Government Information Technology to make the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        The government is strongly committed to this initiative proceeding in the context of the next budget. It will enable us to deliver more effective and efficient services to the community. It is my understanding that this is one of the more significant outsourcing initiatives ever undertaken on a national government basis. Outsourcing of IT is common in both the government at state level and the private sector, and the Commonwealth is lagging behind. This initiative will provide opportunities to Australian industry in the provision of direct outsourcing services to government agencies as well as in strategic alliances with global service providers to take advantage of the significant opportunities on the world stage that this scale of operations will bring.

        To ensure that the initiative is pursued with vigour, I am creating a new policy advisory committee, which will be chaired by the chief government information officer, to provide me with timely and relevant advice on this outsourcing initiative and other major policy undertakings. The committee replaces the existing government information services policy board to better reflect the priorities of this government.

        As I have indicated, outsourcing is commonplace in the private sector. Therefore, I felt that the government would benefit from private sector participation at a senior level. The committee will consist of eight members—four senior public servants and four private sector executives, all of whom have had extensive experience in the innovative application of information technology to deliver goods and services to their customers. Their independent advice will cover areas such as outsourcing strategies for the government's computing infrastructure, government telecommunication network rationalisation strategies, electronic transmission of information in government, one-stop shop delivery of government services and Commonwealth-state cooperation in IT infrastructure provision.

The previous government had a recommendation in 1991 that further surveillance around Cairns was needed and they ignored that recommendation. They did nothing about it.

         —I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. In order to answer the question it would be appropriate to account for some of the history of this. The former government announced the closure of Essendon airport. The context in which they made that decision was a number of aircraft incidents at the airport, the most notable of which was a crash of an aircraft into a house near the Essendon airport. That incident raised a number of questions about the suitability of Essendon airport as a future aviation centre in the Melbourne metropolitan area.

        This government came into office and has taken an open mind on this subject, recognising the importance of Essendon airport in its regional role, its air ambulance role and in terms of the economic activity it generates within the local area. Therefore, we have been consulting with a number of interested parties. I have met with the airport chamber of commerce just recently, for example, and we have also been talking to the air ambulance people and a host of other people. We will continue to consult with interested persons with a role to play in Essendon airport and we will be making our decision very shortly about the future of Essendon.

         —The reason why the government policy is to seek a contribution from non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents under child support is that the government believes that both parents are responsible for the children that they bring into the world, whether they have custody of them or not. The reality is that if the parents are not going to be made to make a contribution it is only going to be other taxpayers who will be picking up the difference.

        As a matter of policy, our government believes that the parents are the first area of responsibility and that there should be mechanisms for the parents to make a contribution. Where the parents are unable to do so, of course there is a social security net which steps in for the sake of the children. I believe that no humane society could have it otherwise.

        Non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents cannot believe that they lose responsibility for the maintenance and rearing of children once they lose custody. I think we all recognise that family breakdown is a terrible thing and to be avoided as far as possible.

Secondly, in Norforce, which has a strength of 400 personnel, 20 to 25 per cent are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, and of course will be well known to the member for the Northern Territory.

        This government is only six months old, yet it has seen ministers clearly breach guidelines established by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for proper conduct of their affairs—both their personal ones and their parliamentary ones. The Prime Minister has had to defend his Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) after he came into this place and blatantly misled the House. The Prime Minister has had to endure the humiliation of seeing his Treasurer (Mr Costello) parade around the globe, and then effectively had to come into this place and defend his Treasurer, who engaged in a completely unprecedented revelation of private conversations between himself and one of the most important people in financial markets in the world.

        The Prime Minister now comes into this place, clearly not having gone through any of the questions he ought to have asked Senator Short last night when he was determining whether or not Senator Short's commission ought to have been terminated. When he walks here this place, he decides that the basis of his defence will be not to say that he has actively and properly upheld those guidelines but to make reference to the fact that we have on the front bench somebody who was a victim of a rorted political royal commission in Western Australia.

Had he done so or had he got his office staff to do so—if they were not so preoccupied with wandering around the place working out how to defend themselves before their next appearance before Senate estimates committees—he might have arrived at some sort of conclusion that the near $10,000 profit that he made was something that should not have happened.

        Listen, Mr Prime Minister: no doubt you yourself have had the benefit of putting in place before your various ministers what their ministerial responsibilities are. You need to comprehend this, because this is what was put before your Assistant Treasurer. Your Assistant Treasurer was given this mandate from his boss:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        He has been given some specific responsibilities in relation to the RSAs. Now the Prime Minister says: `It doesn't matter that he has those specific responsibilities because we had the RSAs in place before the election.' So, on the basis of that, the minister with responsibility for mines could have a set of shares in uranium mines, knowing that before the election you had a proposal to abandon the three mines policy. He could have had shares in Western Mining or any of the others and it would not have mattered if he had kept them. It would not have mattered if Senator Parer had kept them, because it was announced before the election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the basis of that morality, having been announced before the election, he can afford not to observe your ministerial guidelines. I rather think that Senator Parer got the point. I rather think that Senator Parer, even though the three mines policy and the other aspects of your mining policy had been announced before then, irrespective of that, as the minister directly associated with that, would have done something about it. I will say one or two other things about these RSAs. I have here a note from the Treasurer in which he says:
       </para>
       <break page="5223" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Assistant Treasurer will be responsible for finalising the details of requirements that will apply to the RSAs.
        </para>
        <para>
         Understand this about these RSAs: these RSAs are at the heart of a major campaign by the banks to secure resources off the superannuation funds. This is not a minor banking issue. This is not a matter of side concern. The government is doing things like contemplating wrecking the position that ordinary Australians currently have in relation to their superannuation entitlements and foreshadowed superannuation entitlements in favour of providing funds for getting the RSAs going. But, somehow or other, that one line position that the Liberal Party put out before the election is a position which excuses this particular minister, by that fact alone, from being obliged to consider whether or not his banking shares would improve in value as a result of it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But these are not small matters that he must consider. I have here more than a dozen pages—in fact, about 17 or 18 pages—of highly detailed points to be considered in establishing the RSAs. Determinations or decisions on any one of these points will be decisions which make a massive difference to the profitability of banks in the future, will make a massive difference to the value of their shares, will make a massive difference to the posture of the banks in the financial community of this country.

         This is their fightback; this is their defence against the superannuation funds. And point&amp;hyphen;man in that fightback at the administrative level is Senator Short. The point&amp;hyphen;man as far as the government's administrative arrangements are concerned is Senator Short. I would not mind betting that a fair bit of that 10 grand that he proposed to mosey off with when he sells these shares has been made on the basis of a bit of a shrewd judgment; in fact, all banking shares have done pretty well since the advent of propositions like this put forward by the government. I would not mind betting that any reasonable analysis of it would see a very substantial proportion of that 10 grand being absolutely a product of what Senator Short was administratively responsible for.

         —Could I commence my response to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) by making a couple of observations about the context in which this censure motion is moved by the Leader of the Opposition. He raises two issues: the position of Senator Short and the awarding of the gun control campaign contract to the DDB Needham company.

         On the second of those issues, whether or not DDB Needham should have been awarded the gun control contract, I can do no better in starting my response than to quote some words that were uttered by the spokesman in 1989 who had this to say:

         I just happened to have thrust into my hands—and I am grateful to the person who handed it to me—a list of some government contracts. It is a very interesting list. There are two subheadings: the first is John Singleton and the second is Rod Cameron and ANOP. And isn't it interesting? The first subheading reads as follows under John Singleton: `Job description: privatisation of Qantas advertising campaign. Amount $15 million.' Then we have `Artwork for Be Tru Blue stickers'. And, thirdly, the `Buy Australian campaign'. Again in November 1989 another Buy Australian campaign worth $2.4 million. In October 1988 we had the `Austrade national export drive campaign' and the `Part share of the Australian Bicentennial Authority advertising budget'.

What did his Prime Minister do at the time? Of course he overlooked it. But what did Treasury do at the time? They prosecuted about 10,000 Australians for having been guilty of the same offence. Was there a word of attrition?

          Let me make a couple of very direct points about Senator Short. Let me say at the outset of making those observations that at no stage has Senator Short sought to hide from the Australian public, or hide from anybody, the ownership of those ANZ Bank shares. At no stage, in my view, has Senator Short behaved dishonestly. At no stage, in my view, has Senator Short taken a decision which has been influenced or conditioned by his ownership of those shares.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is the critical thing. If you could point to any decision that Senator Short has taken which he would otherwise not have taken if he had not owned those shares, then you would have a case. But you have not made that point; you have not made that case at all. Until you can make that case, you have absolutely no capacity and absolutely no credibility in bringing this motion forward.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If you were to ask me whether Senator Short should have got rid of those shares, the answer is yes. Was he in breach of the guidelines? The answer is clearly that he was. The question, therefore, is: what was the appropriate response of me as Prime Minister on becoming aware of those circumstances? Would it have been a reasonable, appropriate and fair penalty, given the circumstances of the matter and given the fact that Senator Short had at no stage made a decision that was influenced by the ownership of those shares—and that is the critical test of morality in this, that is the hard core test of morality here; you may not like it but you have to face that fact—to have asked for his resignation? If Senator Short had taken such a decision, I believe Senator Short's resignation would have automatically followed. But the fact is that he had not done so. Having been satisfied that his personal honesty in the matter was not in question, I took the decision, given the fact that it was in his early months as a member of the ministry, that it would have
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           been an unreasonably harsh penalty to have required his resignation.

I have taken the action that I have because I believe that he was not setting out to be dishonest. He did not take a decision that was influenced by the ownership of those ANZ shares. If he had not owned those shares, I do not believe the decisions that he would have taken, the attitudes he would have expressed and the views he would have held would have been any different at all from the views he actually held, the actions he took and the decisions he made.

          That is the background of the decision that I have taken in relation to this matter.

Of course, the opposition will have its penn'orth of fun on this issue. I will be criticised for not having sacked him. I accept that. But, in the long run, you have to make a balanced, mature judgment on something like this. I think, in all of the circumstances, given the palpable demonstration on behalf of Senator Short that there was no intention on his part
          <break page="5227" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           to behave dishonestly, given obviously the fact that Senator Short at no stage took a decision that was influenced by the ownership of those shares, to have required his resignation would have been unreasonable.

Surely it does not mean when you are found out but when you know you have been appointed, when you have taken the commission at Government House. You know you have responsibility because the Treasurer (Mr Costello) gives you responsibility for banking.

You have a family trust set up to accommodate them.

People over there might think that is not a big windfall because they are used to the millions of dollars, but let us just understand the enormity of this. It is a 23 per cent increase in six months, and yet you have the audacity to tell the battlers of Lindsay that they cannot have an 8.75 per cent wage increase for the next 12 months.

The reason it is a $9,083 profit is that the package is worth $50,000. It is more than twice what the battlers of Lindsay earn in a year, and you say that it is not significant.

         The reality is this: the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) has profited. No amount of sophistry and no amount of redefining can convince people otherwise. This is a massive profit. It is a profit because the minister concerned presided over policy which has seen those shares rise. You say that he did not make any decision based upon the holding of shares. What nonsense! The fact of the matter is that, in the first instance, he has responsibility for the Wallace inquiry.

The ANZ is the main takeover target for the National Australia Bank. If in fact that happened as a result of the Wallace inquiry recommendations, the share price would go through the roof.

The lack of logic that has been put forward by the opposition in relation to this censure has not been overcome by the ranting and raving of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). It is an infallible guide in this parliament that, the weaker the argument, the higher the decibel level. An infallible argument brings up the decibel level every time. We heard from the member for Hotham high decibels but very little fact.

        The argument being conducted by the member for Hotham was at two levels. At the first level the member for Hotham says that here is a ministerial guideline that says you should not hold shares in certain circumstances—a point which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) readily conceded in question time. That is not the subject of this debate. But at the second level—this is where the smear and the slur begin—he argues that Senator Short somehow has moved the ANZ share price by reason of his office and taken a profit. That is the smear that you have been putting through.

        I move this motion following events in the management of the House in the last 24 hours, and in particular against a background where we had an agreement with the opposition that the appropriation bills, the budget bills, would be sent to the Main Committee so all members would have ample opportunity to make a contribution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Deputy Speaker, the former government established the Main Committee. In 1995, they themselves took the budget to the Main Committee with our agreement. That provided members with an opportunity to speak on the budget and, in particular, to contribute to consideration in detail in the committee stage.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         With the 1996 budget, the first budget of the coalition government, we agreed with the opposition parties to adopt the same practice and procedure. I thought that was quite sensible. They had been at pains to justify and to extol the virtues of the committee process as a means of giving members an opportunity to speak. In a sensible, bipartisan way we agreed with the now opposition, the former government, that that was a fair way to deal with matters.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This week the appropriation bills were sent to the Main Committee with the opposition's agreement. It was a sensible process. Unfortunately, in breach of that agreement, the opposition tactics committee decided to send the budget bills back to the lower house, knowing full well that they had failed to agree to the transmission of some other budget related bills to the Main Committee, thereby leading to even greater pressures on time in the lower house.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we have the rather absurd position where the Labor Party were instrumental in establishing the Main Committee—they used the Main Committee for debate on the budget, and we agreed with them that we would so follow the precedent this year—but then, in an absolutely clear, black and white case, they have breached the agreement we entered into. Under those circumstances the government is left with absolutely no choice whatsoever but to move this motion this afternoon so that the House can proceed with the business which we otherwise intended to proceed with, and so that we can also ensure the transmission of this legislation to the Senate for further debate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very important that the budget be passed; it is important that members have the opportunity to speak on it. I think members will be interested to know that in fact already we have had very substantial debate on the budget in the second reading stage. Already we have had something in the order of 31 or 32 hours of debate on the budget. All members who put their names on the list to speak on the budget bills in the second reading debate stage have in fact spoken. Therefore, no&amp;hyphen;one could say in any sense whatsoever that
         <break page="5236" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          anyone has been denied an opportunity to speak.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we look at the numbers, as I said, it is interesting to see that this year on the budget we have had something in the order of 32 hours of debate in this chamber and in the Main Committee. Of course, this motion will prevent further debate on the budget, in particular that part of the debate which is consideration in detail of the respective portfolios in the committee stage. That is regrettable, but it is a consequence of the opposition's breach of the agreement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we look at the total time allocated to members to speak on the budget this year, 32 hours, and take into account consideration in detail as well as debate in the second reading stage in previous years, this year we have had substantially more debate already on the budget bills than in the last two or three years. For example, in 1995—so I am advised by the Chamber Research Office—we had something like 24 hours total of debate in the second reading and committee stages. In 1994, we had something like 18 hours and 16 minutes, plus six hours and 45 minutes in committee, a total of 25 hours. When we go back to 1993, which was an election year so a comparable year in some regards, we had 18 hours and 55 minutes of debate in the second reading stage and nine hours in the debate on consideration in detail in the committee stage, a total of 28 hours.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So it can be seen that the time we provided for the budget debate on this occasion has in fact exceeded the total time provided for members to speak on the budget in previous years. We think that that is very important. In fact, we would have liked to have provided further time. As I said, we had an agreement with the opposition parties that members would have further opportunity to speak but, unfortunately, as a direct result of their guerilla tactics in the Main Committee, that obviously is not possible.

         In my dealings with the opposition parties it is a common thing for them to defend their actions by saying that when we were in opposition we were just as bad as they are now. Particularly for those who are new members, the truth of the matter is that as an

You could expect the guffaws but I cannot remember, for example, the opposition, as we then were, getting up and moving an adjournment of the House as they did a few months ago.

         I know what he will say. His answer will be that they do not agree with the processes entered into for the handling of the euthanasia debate. In other words, what they are basically running here is a secondary boycott on the Main Committee. There is some aspect of government policy they do not like so therefore they are going to deny their own people the opportunity to speak. We deny our own people the opportunity to speak but we are not doing it because we want to; we are doing it because we are forced to. But the people on that side are denying their own people the opportunity to speak and then the Manager of Opposition Business is going to stand up and say that we have a fall-off in parliamentary standards. How absurd can you get! Yet again I say to you: you justify a breach of an agreement.

         I say to the honourable member: we are going to put matters back into the Main Committee again next week. We would hope that you do not employ the same guerilla tactics as you did this week. If you do, then you will simply deny people again the opportunity to speak and it will show how hollow your claims are about the importance of giving people an opportunity to speak and the success of the Main Committee. I think it can work but it can work only if you put aside your silly guerilla tactics and apply a bit more commonsense to the procedures of this House.

        Let us go to the question of why we have moved the appropriation bills out of the Main Committee. The Main Committee was established by us and can only work if there is a consensus. Why? Because when we agreed to set up the Main Committee when we were in office it was the then opposition that insisted, headed by Peter Reith, that it was the right of one person at any one time to refer matters back into this chamber. That is the basis upon which the Main Committee works. It must have a consensus to function.

        But you breached the consensus. You breached the consensus because there was a very strong body of opinion from both sides of the parliament that the euthanasia debate should be held here. So important was it that you have had the first crossing of the floor from a member on your side. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) felt so strongly about the approach that you took in breaching the convention that he crossed the floor. I wonder what sort of little disciplinary actions you have got in mind for him.

        The fact is it was you, as Leader of the House, who breached the consensus. The Leader of the House tries to pretend that we had an agreement to do that. That is not correct, and his deputy is nodding his head.

        The Leader of the House only recently observed that the guillotine had been used only in an extremely limited way in the first part of the government's term of office. Here we see the guillotine being applied to appropriation bills Nos 1 and 2 and the parliamentary departments bill, which in effect will limit the opportunity for members to contribute to debate on some of the most important bills of the parliamentary term. Consistent with the undertakings made during and after the election that the standards of the House would be raised, I should have thought that such an approach is inconsistent. We are now seeing the winter of the coalition's new approach to parliamentary procedures coming to pass.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is it in order for the Leader of the House to suggest at 5.15 p.m. that some motion be cut off at 5 o'clock? Doesn't that contradict standing orders? How can you say that the debate on a bill has finished before you have closed the motion? I have never heard of this in all my years in parliament. No such procedure has ever been used; this is nonsense.

        The government's law and justice policy foreshadowed a `statute stocktake' to repair existing Commonwealth legislation, with a view to having the repair process in sight of completion by 2001. The processes for the statute stocktake, and a program for the next five years, are still to be worked out. However, the Statute Law Revision Bill begins the work of repairing the Commonwealth statute book. The bill deals with four aspects of repairing the statute book.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, it repeals a number of acts whose operation is exhausted. Secondly, it corrects minor clerical and drafting errors in various current acts. The kinds of errors being corrected are spelling mistakes, mistakes in punctuation, mistakes in the numbering or lettering of parts of acts—for example, incorrect numbering of subsections or incorrect lettering of paragraphs—and misdescribed amendments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A misdescribed amendment is one that either incorrectly describes the text to be amended or specifies the wrong location for the insertion of new text. Although the intended effect of the amendments is usually clear, it can be confusing or misleading to leave these errors uncorrected. In particular, misdescribed amendments can delay the publication of official reprints, and can affect the accuracy of commercial consolidations of acts. For instance, an amendment that purports to require a new provision to be inserted after a non&amp;hyphen;existent provision would probably be given some meaning by a court if the general intention of the amendment were clear. However, it would be inappropriate to publish an official reprint when the act cannot be consolidated because the proper location of the new provision is not clear.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Correcting errors of these kinds does not change the law. However, it ensures that consolidated acts can be published, and without confusing mistakes. In some cases, this may have a significant impact on the accessibility of legislation. I confirm to the Main Committee that the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, has approved the amendments to the Corporations Law which are included in this bill, in accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on future corporate regulation in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Thirdly, the bill brings up to date a large number of references in acts to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. In 1988 the name of the act was changed from Remuneration Tribunals Act to Remuneration Tribunal Act. Although the old form of the title in legislation does not create any legal problems, it is desirable that all references to the act reflect the current form of its title.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, the bill continues the process which has been going on for some years of altering gender specific language in acts. The main element in this process is the insertion of feminine
        <break page="5249" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         pronouns to accompany masculine pronouns wherever they occur. This bill, while not changing the law, makes many useful improvements to the statute book. I commend the bill to the Main Committee and I present the explanatory memorandum.

         —The opposition supports the Statute Law Revision Bill 1996 and agrees that it is sensible and appropriate. Bills of this nature were first introduced in 1981, according to my research, by the then Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Senator Durack, and have been a regular occurrence since then. Senator Durack said in the 1981 second reading speech:

       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Without regular passage of bills of this kind, the correction of an error in an Act can only be achieved by having a special Bill passed for that purpose or waiting until the Act needs to be amended for some other more important purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        In participating in that debate in 1981, Senator Evans said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I, for one, certainly applaud that as a rational legislative measure aiding in the avoidance of the unnecessary cluttering of the parliamentary process with what are on any view small issues most of the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, we expect all Australians to comply with legislation, once it is enacted. The very least parliament can do is to ensure that the legislation is accurate, up to date, intelligible and certain of interpretation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my former life as a lawyer, I know how often those requirements were not met. I must frankly admit that there was perhaps more than one occasion that I, with my fellow legal colleagues, profited from ambiguities and uncertainties existing in legislation. Clearly, that should not occur; and bills such as this are essential to remove those uncertainties and to clarify ambiguities. Indeed, if I may suggest it, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) might consider establishing some formal line of communication between legal practitioners and the judiciary with the government, so that those practising in a particular area can bring to the attention of relevant ministers any drafting errors or ambiguities that they may detect in dealing with a piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other issue that is very relevant to bills such as this—which have gathered over the years the name `omnibus bills', because there are so many passengers riding in them, in the form of so many other acts referred to—is that these amendments be communicated to the public, lawyers and the court system. I note that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General referred to the fact that these errors, if uncorrected, can delay the publication of acts and can affect the accuracy of commercial services and the like which disseminate information about those acts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For a number of years, the government printer has issued monthly tables of acts passed by parliament; tables which indicate whenever an act is amended by an omnibus act, such as the Statute Law Revision Bill represents. I note that it has been the position of both major parties to utilise and develop on&amp;hyphen;line technology and, specifically, access to acts and statutory instruments through the Internet and other on&amp;hyphen;line services. A few weeks ago, legislation in respect of updating statutory instruments and facilitating their downloading onto such on&amp;hyphen;line services was considered in this Main Committee chamber and approved, and that is certainly a very worthwhile development which makes government much more relevant to the way people live.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is certainly well and truly worth while, I believe, for the government to concentrate more resources on that area because, ultimately, access to up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date and accurate law significantly reduces uncertainty, disputation and the cost of justice. In that context, clearly, the opposition
        <break page="5250" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         supports this bill. I should add a word of caution, however, that bills such as this, by their nature, traverse a wide range of statutes and topics within those statutes, and it is important to ensure that amendments are indeed uncontroversial and straightforward. I do not suggest this bill is otherwise but, clearly, it is something to be borne in mind when bills of this nature are prepared, as the logistics of considering the many provisions are such that is very difficult to give detailed consideration to them.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General proposes, effectively, a statute stocktake to be completed by the year 2000, which is something we in the opposition would commend. However, that caution is relevant, we believe, in the sense that it is important that any systematic or mechanical revision to clarify or correct minor amendments, such as these, should indeed be restricted to such minor amendments and should not delve into areas which are of more substance or controversy. Again, I do not suggest this bill is otherwise than straightforward, sensible and practical, and we support it.

         —in reply—I thank the opposition and the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) for their support for the Statute Law Revision Bill 1996. I thank the member for his comments, which will be given appropriate consideration. He mentioned, as I did, the proposed statute stocktake. It might assist if I comment a little further on that. The statute stocktake, we envisage, will be undertaken by a statute law revision unit within the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. It will not just be for correcting errors. We hope its targets will be set a bit higher than that.

        There are many statutes which contain virtually identical provisions. Those setting up authorities, for example, contain provisions relating to members' remuneration, appointment, reappointment and removal. It might be feasible to have a standard set of provisions in an act to which other acts can simply refer. This will shorten the statute book and provide assistance to those reading the statutes by having the same provisions applicable. Decisions of courts on the provisions are then more readily available and have a wider application. That is a long&amp;hyphen;term project, as I mentioned earlier, but it is one that I think is compatible with the achievement of economy and efficiency in government. This being a non&amp;hyphen;controversial bill, I will leave my comments at that point.

       In the tables that follow, "companies" includes sole traders, partnerships and other entities that are not "employer organisations".

       Yes. Staff of my office had discussions with Kinetic Technology International, an Australian company which was developing a new technology hand&amp;hyphen;held emergency locator transmitter (ELT) that would conform with the regulations under CAR 252A. Kinetic Technology advised that a significantly smaller hand&amp;hyphen;held ELT would be available commercially in the first half of 1997.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       On 5 June 1996, the Government amended the proposed compliance date of CAR 252A from 1 July 1996 to 31 July 1997 to allow a reasonable lead time for industry to implement the requirements for the carriage of ELTs. The revised start&amp;hyphen;up date will also enable Australian aviators to have access to new and improved technology incorporated in the Kinetic Technology's hand&amp;hyphen;held ELT. However, there is nothing to prevent any aircraft owner from installing an ELT, either fixed or hand&amp;hyphen;held, before that date.

       (a) Claims that the restructuring of AGAL laboratories threatens public safety are simply not true.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Initial investigations of incidents such as food poisoning are the responsibility of state public health laboratories. For example, AGAL was not involved in the initial investigation of the Garibaldi incident; this was handled by the South Australian Government's Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS). AGAL nationally has since been involved in investigative work to assist the development of standards and protocols to prevent a repeat of such an incident.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The SA Government's IMVS is in fact the Australian reference laboratory for Salmonella and E&amp;hyphen;coli bacteria—the causes of recent major food poisoning outbreaks. Suspected food poisoning cases anywhere in Australia are referred to the IMVS laboratory in Adelaide for confirmation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

       AGAL provides a number of very important services to government, industry and the community, including significant public interest roles in protecting public health, export food markets and the environment, and in the analysis of drugs&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;sport and illicit drugs. The Government believes there is a clear role for AGAL as a Government laboratory, but that it is important to get the current operations working effectively within the principles of competitive neutrality.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has advised that, at the end of August 1996, there was an approximate minimum of 155,000 people nationally (excluding South Australia) who were British subjects, but not Australian citizens, at the time of their enrolment. Some of these people may have since taken out Australian citizenship, however, it is not possible to determine the numbers.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The AEC further advises that these are the number whose enrolment details have changed in some way (for example they have moved address) and have re-enrolled since 1984, and accordingly have had their enrolment entry coded as being British subjects. Those who were enrolled before 1984 and whose entitlement has not changed in any way will still be enrolled, but will not have been coded on the Roll as being in that category. To do so would be a very expensive exercise.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The South Australian Roll is currently on a separate database and British subjects are not separately identified on that database.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The legal position under section 93(1)(b)(ii) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 is that the only non-Australian citizens who are eligible to vote are those British subjects who were on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll immediately before 26 January 1984.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The Commonwealth enrolment qualifications were changed in 1981 because it was the view of all political parties and governments, State and Commonwealth, that Australian citizenship is the appropriate qualification.

       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       However, when these qualifications were changed it was considered unfair to disenfranchise British subjects who were already entitled to enrol and vote. Consequently, British subjects who were already enrolled at the date of transition were able to retain their franchise.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) The Government will not be moving to change the franchise qualifications in the foreseeable future.
