         —My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, yesterday you refused to nominate a jobs target. Are you aware of advice from the employment department to your incoming government that Labor was on track to achieve its five per cent target? Are you aware that that advice projected `an average annual growth rate of 2.2 per cent for total employment which is considered to be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down to five per cent'? Against that advice, doesn't the NILS document which you refused to table yesterday state that, under a growth scenario more closely linked to your budget projections, unemployment could be as high as 8.1 per cent? Is that your employment target? I seek leave to table the document.

        Now that the government has brought down a set of reasonable, fair and responsible decisions seeking, amongst other things, to provide universities with the flexibility to improve their resourcing, it is not surprising that across the university sector there is strong support for the government's measures and advocacy that they should be passed through the Senate.

        Mr Acting Speaker, you would be aware that, as part of the budget, the government announced significant improvements for rollover relief for small business in relation to the capital gains tax. The rollover relief will encourage small and medium sized enterprises to continue to expand by increasing the size of their businesses and by allowing the rollover of assets.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The features of the rollover relief announced in the budget are specifically targeted to small business. Rollover relief will be provided where the disposal and acquisition of some or all of the assets are for use in the same or another like kind business; where the proceeds from the disposal of an asset are reinvested within 12 months in the same or a like kind business; and where the taxpayer's
        <break page="3824" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         total net business assets, including passive and active assets, do not exceed $5 million. Taxpayers will be eligible to claim rollover relief once every five years. This is a long overdue tax reform. After it is introduced, it is expected to relieve small business of up to $150 million in taxation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To allow sufficient time for consultation with the tax professions and small business on the operation of the measure, the rollover relief provisions will apply from 1 July 1997. The consultation process is already under way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to that, the government announced provisions to allow small business to rollover their savings into retirement. There are many small business proprietors who invest every dollar they have in their business, and they have the opportunity to use that not only as their livelihood but also as their savings. The relief of capital gains tax will also give them the opportunity to treat their business as part of their retirement planning.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is clear that these reforms are well overdue. It is clear that they underline a commitment to the small business sector by the coalition government. They are welcome reforms; they will be of strong benefit to small business. It is part of the government's plan to grow small businesses bigger and to create employment and to encourage business in this country.

This budget not only reduces the deficit by some $7.2 billion in the course of two years but also, within that very challenging framework, moves forward on a range of key fronts for provincial Australia, for rural and regional Australia, to boost exports in the electorate of the member for Wannon, and many other country electorates, to Asia and beyond.

         In that regard, the decision made by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and others with respect to the diesel fuel rebate scheme was absolutely correct in the interests of the export effort of the nation. In that regard, $150 million in capital gains tax rollover is the way to get small business back on its feet. The sooner the unfair dismissal law of Labor is abolished the better it will be for all small business.

         I would just add that there was another great agony created by the legacy of Labor; that is, the increasing gap in the educational opportunities of children beyond the capital cities with regard to primary education, secondary education and tertiary education. This budget increases the boarding allowance, it increases the primary correspondence allowance and it increases the secondary correspondence allowance. This budget, in short, delivers for all Australians, including country Australians. In respect of trade, it retains a better focused export market development grants scheme which will boost our exports to Asia and beyond.

         Let me tell you what you did when you were in government: you made four changes that whacked private health insurance premiums up. The first is that you changed the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. The second thing is you took away the reinsurance pool. The third thing is cost shifting from public hospitals to private hospitals and the fourth thing is that you took off the Commonwealth bed day cover subsidy. The net effect of all of these, according to Access Economics, was to add something like $850 million onto premiums, which put up the premiums 39 per cent—

The simple fact is that, when Medicare—you love to wrap yourselves in its flag—was constructed, the people who constructed it did so on the basis of explicit support for the private system by way of a reinsurance pool and by way of a Commonwealth bed day subsidy because they realised they needed the private sector to make Medicare work. You took those away. You took away the Commonwealth's contribution to that; and the direct result is private premiums 39 per cent higher than they need to be.

         You can knock, you can whinge, you can nitpick all you like but it is very interesting to have a look at the changed words of the Leader of the Opposition. Back on 8 August he was all hairy chested and saying, `We will take a very jaundiced view on this. We are not going to implement something that is universally canned.' Yet on 6 September he was saying, `Oh, it's probably necessary to support the health insurance incentives.'

         What changed in a month? I can tell you what changed: Gary Gray came over and said, `Oh, boss, you can't do this; you can't change it; the polling says it's good. We'll be unpopular if we do what you said back on 8 August.' So you did a backflip. You haven't got the guts to stick by your convictions and you've turned around and said, `Oh, we've probably got to support it.' Well you bet you've probably got to support it because the fact is that this is something that will directly benefit mainstream Australia and your knocking, your whingeing and your inability to put forward anything different shows why you are in opposition and why you are going to stay there a hell of a long time.

        The government also played an active role for a long time in the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Throughout that process, which lasted about 2&amp;half; years, Australia always played a constructive role. It was then a matter of great disappointment to us that the Conference on Disarmament was unable to reach the appropriate consensus on the text for a comprehensive test ban treaty, and there was a general view that the lack of consensus would lead to failure of the treaty to be concluded.

And yet under Labor the needs of families were ignored or forgotten. High interest rates, unemployment and the recession that we had to have caused terrible pain and agony for many Australian families, particularly in rural and regional Australia.

        In the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the election this government recognised and acknowledged the difficulties that Australian families faced.

        The budget will help families in a number of ways. The family tax initiative will be delivered on time and in full. The family tax initiative recognises the tensions and the difficulties that Australian families face in a financial sense. It is the most significant and the most comprehensive tax package that has ever been delivered to Australian families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are some on the other side of the House who have been putting about in the community that the family tax initiative will not help working women in Australia. But I would just like to remind the House that there are 300,000 sole parent families in Australia, the majority of whom are women. For those women, the family tax initiative will give them a significant boost to family income. In addition to that, many Australian women work part time. We know that the majority of part-time jobs are occupied by women. Many of those women will also receive the benefit of the family tax initiative.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Apart from the family tax initiative, there has been a significant boost to emergency relief funding. We know that the pressures on Australian families through the recession that we had to have have caused a crisis in some areas. When I visited Townsville recently and I met with the community aid groups in Townsville, I learned that they have had a 600 per cent increase in crisis for families. That has put considerable pressure on them. We have addressed that problem. We have recognised the pressure on aid delivery to Australian families in crisis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There has also been great concern in the Australian community in relation to the abuse and neglect of children. This has been exacerbated by the recent findings of the Wood royal commission in New South Wales. The difficulty in this area is that there is a growing number of children who are suffering from abuse and neglect in the community. In recognition of that, the government has allocated funding for parent support and parent education programs. This is crucial: if we are going to be a compassionate society, a strong and cohesive society, we have to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         give due recognition to our children and to their care. In that respect, we have to deal with the problem of serious abuse and neglect of our young children.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to young people, we have the youth homeless pilot program which recognises that there are far too many young children out there—some 12,000 young people every night—who do not have a home to go to and who are considered homeless. These young people are also the most vulnerable in terms of abuse and neglect in the community. The Prime Minister, in recognition of that, has set up the youth homeless pilot program under the direction of Captain David Eldridge.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have in Australia today one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the Western world. This is often linked to their unemployment and to the recessions particularly in rural Australia where the problem is very acute. This government has addressed this problem by setting aside funding for a program in youth suicide that will support and sustain communities, help them to recognise the signals and make sure that young people in the community are supported and sustained.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The supported accommodation program also helps those in our community who are homeless and, as I said, there are many thousands of young people who are homeless in our community. The supported accommodation program is also vital to women who are subjected to domestic violence—again, a growing problem in our community. Also in recognition of families, we have introduced marriage and relationship education and a national campaign against violence and crimes in recognition of the deep concern that the Australian community has for a growing number of people subjected to crime in the community.

Has the minister seen a report of comments by Mr Bob Officer, the Chairman of the government's National Commission of Audit, in which he describes the harsh budget measure to introduce an up-front fee for nursing home patients in the following terms:  `It's not a death tax. Instead of a pay as you go, it's a pay after you go (tax).' Does the minister support Mr Officer's description of that terrible budget measure?

         I do not accept that proposition at all. We had inherited an age care system that was in total disrepair. It was in decline. The Labor government when it was in office was told three years ago that it needed to inject a considerable amount of capital into the nursing home sector. It failed to take that advice. In fact, I understand that the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, was a consultant to the former government in this respect. I wonder whether the government chose to ignore the advice or whether the advice was simply never given.

        In Australia, high cost drugs come onto the pharmaceutical benefits scheme after approval by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. This is not a political process; it is an expert scientific process that relies very heavily on cost-effectiveness. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has considered Betaferon on five occasions—three

        What has happened recently is that the drug company Schering has agreed to drop the price of the drug very substantially and has also agreed to pay the cost of monitoring and testing people on the drug to make sure it is effective. This has meant that, at the last meeting over last weekend, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee was able to recommend to the government that it list Betaferon on the PBS.

        Betaferon is a trade name for Beta Interferon, which offers some hope to people with multiple sclerosis. This is important because this illness up till now has had very little treatment—the only treatment being steroids. It reduces the number of relapses that people with multiple sclerosis have, but it has yet to be shown to actually reduce life expectancy in multiple sclerosis. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has recommended that Betaferon be made available to people with remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis where there have been two documented attacks over two years and this has been proved on magnetic resonance imaging scanning.

        A second authority will be given only to people who do not show progression of the illness once they have taken Betaferon and who have shown that they can comply with and tolerate therapy. Third and subsequent authorities will be given only if people have not been shown to develop antibodies or a type of resistance to the therapy. That will be on the basis of tests that the drug company will apply for.

        I have to personally see the recommendation, but the cost over a full year for this narrow group of people will be about $7 million. On receiving the advice, I am very well disposed towards approving it. Normally, this would come into effect from 1 February 1997—and this has been the PBAC's recommendation. I am seeing whether there is any possible way that we could bring that forward and make it available earlier.

         —One of the great contrasts between the government and the opposition in our policies for young people is that we believe in getting young people into real jobs. One of the great historic pathways into real jobs has been the apprenticeship system.

        One of the tragedies of the previous government is that it virtually abandoned the apprenticeship system. It allowed it to wither on the vine. It did nothing to modernise it. It did nothing to expand opportunities in apprenticeships. As a consequence of this, in 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest it had been for three decades.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is because of the apprenticeship decisions in this budget that this budget can truly claim to be a budget for young Australians. Over the next four years, this government will be putting some $200 million into the modernisation of the apprenticeship and training system. This money will be used to produce new apprenticeships in new industries, in information industries, service industries, and multi&amp;hyphen;media. It will be used to modernise the traditional apprenticeship system. It will encourage flexible hiring arrangements and multiple workplace placements for apprentices through the group training companies.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the key innovations—and I think one of the most exciting innovations that has got tremendous public support—is that it will be used to develop school based apprenticeships. A young person can be in employment for a couple of days a week and spend three days a week in school studying for the off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job component. As outlined in the budget, over the next four years the government will be putting $187 million into the development of vocational education in schools.

You were not prepared to ask them to wait until 1 July when the tax rebate was meant to make a difference to the viability of the funds.

        What really happened is that the government offered the money with the tax carrot and the health funds turned it into a lemon. They snatched away that $1.7 billion. That means that the money will not end up in the contributors' pockets. To every member of the public in the gallery today, to every Australian who will feel the increases in the premiums taking away the benefits of the tax rebate, I say: this is the man to blame—Dr Michael Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Human Services—who took no action when he knew that these premium increases were going to flow through.

        This is the person who did not direct his department to intervene and take some action.

        That was the Prime Minister on 28 August after this minister had known for three weeks that one fund was increasing its premiums and had known for at least 10 days that a second fund, Australian Unity, was increasing its premiums. Here is the Prime Minister saying to the contributors that they would get the `full value, the full measure, the full benefit' of the tax rebate. It is clear that the government has failed to keep even the commitments made by the Prime Minister as late as 28 August.

         One of the things we will keep probing is what this minister told the Prime Minister before 28 August. Minister, we want to know: did you or your office tell the Prime Minister or his staff that you knew about the increases that were coming through? We also want to know how many of the other funds advised you that they had applied for increases. Sure, you have told us about the two funds which had approval from the department, but how many other funds had told you that they had applied? And did you tell the Prime Minister that these increases were also in the pipeline?

Why is it not good enough for the minister for health in the Prime Minister's government to announce publicly and openly before the budget was brought down that the increases were coming?

        Let me just go through the chronology of this so that I can make the situation utterly clear. When we came into government we kept going a procedure that had been in place at least since Neal Blewett issued a delegation in 1984 but probably for 20 years. We kept in place your system. It is true that since then there have been 23 increases from Australian health funds and these ones were in the pipeline anyway. They would have happened whether the Labor Party had been returned to government or whether the coalition was in government. These have nothing to do with the health insurance rebates we are offering but everything to do with your mismanagement of private health insurance because of your ideological blinkers.

         —As for the budget and the other allegations that are made about the full benefit, you have to look at the context in which that was made. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was quoted as saying prior to the budget, on 8 August, on the ABC, `The health funds will simply increase their premiums to absorb the rebate.' He is trying to scare people that the premiums will go up because of the rebate. It was because of that that on budget night we made the funds report to PHIAC as to their reserves, and we would make sure that we would not do anything other than what was necessary for the prudential management of the funds.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Quite simply there are two separate issues here that you cannot seem to grasp. One is the ongoing problem of health fund increases and the second is the benefit that might come from the rebates. Let me tell you first about the problem that health funds are facing, because that was what the honourable member interjected about.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The crisis in private health is quite simple. In government, you whacked costs onto the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         private health insurance industry that were equal to a 39 per cent increase in premiums. That made younger, fitter people and families drop out and older people stay in the funds. So the age group is being increasingly skewed towards older people and you have a spiral where older people stay in and fit, young people drop out.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The difficulty with this is that when you were in government you effectively destroyed community rating. You would talk about it. But in relation to all your actions—the actions that were underpinning Medicare when it was designed—you needed to have a viable private sector to complement a viable public sector. So we designed our private health insurance incentives very specifically to try to bring back in the people who were dropping out, such as families, and that is why they got the added benefit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At no stage did I ever say that health funds would stop increasing their premiums. It is patently absurd to think that all of a sudden health funds are going to be able to say, `We have put our premiums up once a year because costs keep going up. All of a sudden we are going to stop doing it.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There have been rumours of nine funds putting up their premiums. I cannot find which nine funds these rumours are supposed to refer to, but there is a document from the Private Health Insurance Advisory Council that lists 10 funds so I think this must be the one that is being mentioned. The majority of those funds that have put up their premiums in recent times have done so because they have dropped below the statutory reserves. What you said in your debate before was that somehow I should have said, `No, wait until 1 July next year.' That is patently ridiculous. The result of that would be for me to cause the collapse of health funds. That is what you are suggesting by saying that somehow I shouldn't have approved these.

         Of two other funds that increased their premiums, one did so because it had not increased premiums for four years and the other did so because it had not increased premiums for 2&amp;half; years. Two other funds that increased their premiums did so to try to cope with the 100 per cent cover that you intro duced last year. The direct result of your policy last year was to make two funds put up their premiums—two others increased premiums because they had not done so for up to four years and all the rest did so to meet statutory obligations. So what on earth are you suggesting I do—say to funds, `You cannot stay under statutory requirements'? That is clearly absurd.

        There is also this suggestion going around that I knew about something and that I should have said it. The fact is that I did. You can look at anything I have said publicly, and I gave two examples in question time, or you can look to what I said at a briefing of journalists after the budget. I have been open, honest and frank about the problems in the private health insurance industry. I have said quite specifically that there have been premium rises coming through and I have never walked away from that.

        You have tried to pretend that somehow what is happening will gobble up the benefit. I have news for you: even with the premium increases taken into account, the average benefit to families in Australia will be a 20 per cent reduction in health insurance premiums, and many will be up to 30 per cent. So this will still be of enormous benefit to Australian families.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The shadow minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), is prattling on, `What about Manchester Unity?' Again, this is indicative of the selective understanding he has of the problem. What he has chosen to do is to try to portray the top increase of every fund as the increase applying across all funds. Manchester Unity's increase was substantial on its top table and not substantial on its basic table. As far as I can see, they got the top table wrong because they mis&amp;hyphen;priced your promise of 100 per cent cover.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A lot of the problems of the very large increases—there have been some, and we would have much preferred them not to have happened—relate to the promises and expectations raised by the previous health minister, Dr Lawrence, when she introduced her so-called 100 per cent cover in 1995. The fact is that many funds did get it wrong and did have to reprice it. This is interesting, because
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the previous health minister was saying, `This 100 per cent cover is actually going to lead to a drop in premiums.' Wrong; it has led to up to a 20 per cent increase in some premiums. But, across the whole range of premiums, the rate of increase is less than when you lot were in government. So it is hard to see, quite frankly, what you are on about.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, there is the notion that the Australian public is not getting the full benefit of the private health insurance rebates. The fact is that on 1 July next year they will drop by $450 at least for a family with an income under $70,000. They will get the full benefit. What will happen between now and then is that some more people will drop out of private health insurance, and that was patently clear in our budget documents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second thing that will happen is that premiums will go up, and we have always been quite open about it. But to say that $450 has virtually been stolen away, when you pick the worst possible example and try to pretend that applies across the board, is simply untrue, because the average premium increase of the 23 funds that have increased their premium is 6.1 per cent. That is not 6.1 per cent across 48 funds; that is 6.1 per cent across 23 funds.

        The only massive increase in premiums that has occurred in recent years was in 1991-92. When you were in government, there was a 17 per cent increase in premiums in one year. You cannot get away from that. You have said to me that somehow I knew all along that this was happening and that I should have stopped it. I did not know all along that funds were applying for increases. I knew all along that there was pressure because of longstanding problems that you had introduced, but I did not know the scope, the size or the details

        So to say that I am somehow to blame for increases in private health fund premiums is ridiculous. If anyone is to blame, it is the previous Labor Party, which whacked an extra 39 per cent in costs onto the health funds. To say that I took no action is only to say that I was following a procedure that had been in place certainly for 12 years and probably for 20 years. To say that I misled the public is quite incorrect. I have been open and frank with the public, as demonstrated by the fact that I have been prepared to acknowledge that there were pressures in the system. To say that I misled the leader is completely incorrect because the leader's comments have been exactly spot on. The leader's comments were that at the time I did not know of the increases and I was not informed until after the event.

        The simple fact is that you are showing that you do not understand why you lost government.

They will be of substantial assistance to families who need help and who would get nothing under you.

         —The ability of governments to deliver on election promises competently is always a matter of public importance. Prior to the election, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) sang the praises of his policy which he promised would get more Australians back into private health insurance. At the same time, he gave absolute commitments that Medicare would be preserved in its entirety. But, six months later, the health minister's grand plans have turned to dust. The great hope of the Liberal Party wets, the former deputy leader, has bombed out and, in doing so, has caused his own leader collateral damage.

         record as Minister for Health and Family Services and as the member for Chisholm.

        This minister's six months in office have been absolutely extraordinary. We have had the closure of the Clayton Medicare office; we have had the loss of the dental health program, which serviced, in the last year, over 4,000 Chisholm constituents; we have had a blow&amp;hyphen;out of the number of people waiting on trolleys at the Monash Medical Centre; and we have had the breaking of promises on health funding made to Box Hill people.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, we have the health insurance premium increases. The minister told us all that he would ensure the value of the coalition's private health insurance rebate stayed in the pockets of Australians. Did he not realise that the rebate was simply going to be soaked up by premium increases, that it has amounted to nothing more than a pay&amp;hyphen;off of private health funds, that it was simply a gift to those private health insurers?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yesterday, and indeed this afternoon, the minister stressed the modesty of premium increases by private health insurers under the coalition, claiming that there is a 6.1 per cent average increase. It is a bit difficult to tell that to our own constituents. For example, in my electorate Mr and Mrs Hayward of Pascoe Vale, who are members of Australian Unity, have just been advised that their premium will increase by some $36 a month to $444 a year.

         —To $444 a year. In percentage terms, that is not 6.1 per cent. That is not even 12 per cent. It is a massive 18 per cent. So the value of the rebate has effectively been wiped out a year before it comes into effect. How is that supposed to act as an incentive for the Hayward family to remain in private health insurance? The unpleasant reality for the minister is that across Australia there are
         <break page="3845" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          thousands of families like the Haywards who have been hit by very substantial increases and for whom the coalition's rebate has done absolutely nothing to make private health insurance more affordable.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, we have seen the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. One of Labor's great successes in its last term was this program. The value of the program should not be underestimated. In the minister's own electorate of Chisholm, 4,298 concession card holders and pensioners were treated last year. There are almost 30,000 concession card holders in Chisholm for whom that dental health program was a valuable service. We have received as recently as today information from the Victorian dental hospital saying that waiting lists for dental care will blow out from six months to 11 years if this government's budget goes through.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In February, the minister, as a candidate, happily put out fliers assuring pensioners that all of their entitlements would be preserved, that concessional card holders had nothing whatsoever to worry about. Very shortly after the election, he put on his Expenditure Review Committee hat and declared that the program had achieved its goals and could be scrapped. So the 30,000 Chisholm voters were shamefully misled by the health minister as he pedalled the coalition's hollow promises. For them, this decision comes as a cruel blow. When he was asked about the future of the program earlier this year he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It's particularly important when people get into a nursing home too, because you might have someone who has put a lot of effort into dental care over the years and once they get into a nursing home there's no alternative.
       </para>
       <para>
        The minister has discovered the solution to this problem: you simply prevent people from entering nursing homes in the first place by hitting them with a $30,000 entry contribution. Who is going to worry about their teeth when they are slugged with a $30,000 bill?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Thirdly, we have had the closure of Medicare offices. In December last year, the minister made a solemn declaration, `The coalition provides an absolute commitment to keep Medicare in its entirety.' What the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         minister hid from his electorate was the plan to close Medicare offices—84 of them. The Medicare offices closed include the Clayton office, which provided a vital service to people in his own electorate. Try telling the elderly pensioners in Clayton that they will have to line up in a pharmacy or take a train and bus to Chadstone shopping centre to get a Medicare refund and see if they believe the minister has honoured the coalition's commitment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fourthly, you have the issue of hospital funding for the states, another solemn coalition commitment, `We will not cut public hospital funding.' But what do the budget papers reveal? Hospital funding for the states is to be slashed by $800 million—just what Victorian hospitals need, I can tell you! Let me take the minister back to his local paper. On 20 February it stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . if voters gave him the chance he would address the problems in the states hospitals. . . it was his desire to do something about the pain and suffering he saw in hospitals that led him into politics.
       </para>
       <para>
        Voters gave him that chance—and how has he repaid them? This week we read of a doubling in the number of patients forced to wait on trolleys for more than 12 hours at St Vincent's and the Royal Melbourne Hospital over the past year. There were 400 patients on trolleys at the Royal Melbourne in June—up 98 per cent on last year. At St Vincent's there were 124 patients waiting on trolleys for more than 12 hours in August and almost 40 were left for more than a day. It is little wonder that the St Vincent's Director of Emergency Care, Dr Andrew Dent, described these delays as inhuman.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What has the minister done since his re&amp;hyphen;election to make Victorian hospitals better—as he promised he would? He has done absolutely nothing. The Premiers Conference saw his not so good mate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) knock off $1.5 billion in grants to the states, a third of which could have gone into health funding—and the budget was even worse. There was $800 million to be pulled out.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only conclusion one can draw is that the minister, through his silence, endorses the way Jeff Kennett is destroying the public

         health system in Victoria. Even when Premier Kennett plans to close the Burwood Hospital in the minister's own electorate, we hear nothing.

        So what we conclude is that we have a minister who is asleep at the wheel. As an example of his confusion, let me remind the House of the minister's declaration yesterday that he was on top of absolutely everything to the exact detail. This came immediately after he told the House that anyone who had read the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Herald&amp;hyphen;Sun
        </emphasis>
        on 23 July would have seen an advertisement from National Mutual about higher premiums. Unfortunately for the minister, there is no such National Mutual advertisement in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Herald&amp;hyphen;Sun
        </emphasis>
        edition of that day. There was an advertisement some days later, but not on the 23rd. He needs to look at that before he regards himself as someone on top of absolutely everything to the exact detail.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to remind the minister of his candour when speaking to the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        earlier this year. It reported him saying that if the coalition's health policy is a flop his constituents will almost certainly vote him out. Well, the coalition's health policy can be nothing other than a flop because the minister responsible for it is a flop. On budget night he gave the Australian people an assurance that they would receive the benefit of the tax rebate for private health insurance, but like everything else he has promised over the past six months he has failed to deliver.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In particular, he has let down his own constituents in Chisholm with the closure of the Clayton Medicare office, loss of the dental health program which serves over 4,000 Chisholm constituents, a blow&amp;hyphen;out in the number of people waiting on trolleys at the Monash Medical Centre and the breaking of promises on health funding to Box Hill people.

        The whole debate that we have heard today has had an almost Orwellian overtone. If I might summarise: the ALP were part of a government which saw privatised health cover drop from 65 per cent to 33.6 per cent in June. Direct government actions contributed to a 39 per cent increase over the course of that government in the cost of premiums. During the period of government they showed no commitment to private health.

That is something they never did while in government. The shadow minister has been on a fishing expedition, looking for some evidence that in some way there is some impropriety in the premium increases of private health funds and that there are some problems for the government in that. In actual fact, during the whole period of the 13 years of the Hawke&amp;hyphen;Keating government there were 174 increases in health premiums.

        The debate today is all about politics; it has very little to do with policy. The secret health fund increase was heralded in the

         Herald&amp;hyphen;Sun
        </emphasis>
        and it was also notified to the 200,000 policy holders of National Mutual. So this whole matter of public importance today has been a beat&amp;hyphen;up. It is very important to separate the issue of the private health tax incentives which are being offered to lower and middle income earners and the issue of insurance premium rises. They are two separate issues: insurance premium rises will always occur. There were 174 such increases during the 13&amp;hyphen;year reign of the last government.

        As the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has pointed out, the largest increase occurred in the period when

         Brian Howe, that failed health minister of the Hawke and Keating government, was in charge. There was a 17 per cent blow&amp;hyphen;out in the period 1991 to 1992. You might remember that the rest of the country was in recession at that time and inflation was not terribly high, yet there was a 17 per cent blow&amp;hyphen;out during the period of the last government.

        The ALP have never shown a commitment to private health insurance. They don't believe in private health insurance. Some of them believe in self&amp;hyphen;insurance. That is all right if you are a former Prime Minister or a former health minister. I would imagine that if Paul Keating or his family required surgery they wouldn't go down to Westmead or St George's. They might go to St Vincent's, but I don't imagine they would go to the public part of St Vincent's; it would be more the exclusive clinic. I don't imagine that Carmen Lawrence, if she required surgery, would go to the local Fremantle Hospital, Sir Charles Gairdner or Royal Perth.

        It is all right for those former ministers and former prime ministers to self&amp;hyphen;insure, to decide to contribute to expenses in private hospitals and so on by just paying out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket expenses. What about lower&amp;hyphen; and middle&amp;hyphen;income earners who take out private health insurance? They need some sort of commitment.

        There were 174 increases in health insurance premiums during the period of the Hawke and Keating governments, and how many were opposed by the ALP? Not one. You have to go back to 1974, a year which probably saw the highest inflation ever in Australia, to find a rejection of a health insurance premium increase. They do occur.

        During that period of 13 years, the ALP witnessed a decline in private health insurance from 65 per cent to almost 33.6 per cent in June 1996. Labor focused on Medicare and neglected private health insurance. They never realised that private health cover acts to complement the public health system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It has been estimated that a two per cent drop in private health cover costs this nation the equivalent of 325,000 bed days. That is the equivalent of two major teaching hospitals. The shadow minister raised the question
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of how many hospitals you could buy with the private health incentives, but Labor witnessed, in the course of those last failed Hawke and Keating governments, a decline of over 30 per cent in private health insurance. That is the equivalent of 30 teaching hospitals that has been put onto the public purse. It is only by getting more people into private health that we can reduce the strain on public hospitals, that we can start looking at reducing the waiting lists which were Labor's legacy.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Labor contributed to the decline in private health insurance directly by such initiatives as changing the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. They also removed the reinsurance pool and neglected the whole issue of cost shifting, something that the shadow minister did not understand back in August—I wonder if he understands it now. They also removed the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. All those actions contributed over that period to a 39 per cent increase in premiums.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The tax incentives that this government has announced are directed to lower&amp;hyphen; and middle&amp;hyphen;income people, and about five million people will be eligible for those incentives. The previous government thought that incentives for private health insurance were not necessary. Their response was Carmen Lawrence's managed care legislation. Since the introduction of that legislation in May last year what we have seen is a continuing decline in private health insurance membership. That legislation did not achieve its aim of stemming the haemorrhage from private health cover.

        The main problem is that young and healthy people have left the funds, which has set up a vicious circle whereby the young and healthy who have left have made premiums rise, contributing to more young and healthy people deciding to leave. The reasons for the latest increase in premiums were prudential—to respond to falling health fund reserves. Laurie Oakes's article in the

         The minister has also instructed the department not to approve price increases if they are used to increase the reserves above what is needed for prudential requirements.

         What we need is to encourage young, fit and healthy people to get back into private health insurance and to have the greater access, choice and quality that are available in the private sector. The private sector contributes something like 50 per cent of all surgical procedures in Australia. Private hospitals now provide almost any service which is currently available in the public sector but the fewer members have led to higher premiums.

         Unfortunately, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It is still a huge problem . . . that people are deserting private health insurance at the rate they are. It isn't a problem any of you will worry about tomorrow, but in 10 years time it will be huge.
        </para>

         In so many ways in this budget period Labor want it both ways. They do not believe in private health insurance but they want to portray themselves now as the defenders of people with private health insurance. What they are trying to do today is undermine confidence in the private health system. Is the Labor Party seriously suggesting that we should never see another increase in insurance premiums; that we should never see another increase in insurance premiums that does not have some political overtones?

         About 780,000 people are on incomes below $20,000. These people are holding private health insurance, they are depending on these incentives, they are hanging on—and these incentives will be delivered. Of course health insurance premiums will be kept to a minimum, but we do need private health insurance to complement both Medicare and the public hospital system.

         —In continuation of my remarks on the budget, in the few remaining minutes I have left I would like to address the topic of Aboriginal affairs. This coming financial year we will be allocating some $1,600 million to Aboriginal programs. This will be the second highest amount on record, superseded only by the abnormal amount that was spent last year. In fact, in the next four years we will be spending, in current dollars, $429 million more on Aboriginal affairs than the previous government spent in its last four years.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         want to see funds spent on in Aboriginal affairs are health, housing, education, employment and training. In all those areas we will be spending more. In health, we will be spending 28 per cent more in real terms over the next four years compared with the previous four years—an extra $97 million. Indeed, we will be opening up 23 extra Aboriginal medical services around the country in remote areas, areas that have never been serviced before.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In housing, we will be spending $26 million more over the next four years—a total of $1,323 million. What is more important, on top of that, is that we will be aiming to ensure that we get better value for the dollar. I know that, in the town of Wilcannia in my own electorate, four houses were built there within the last two or three years for $212,000 each. They are not particularly outstanding houses. I think we can get better value for the dollar in the housing area.

        newspaper this morning, there was a letter signed by about a dozen or so people, including a professor or two, virtually implying that the program would be wiped out. The situation is that there are 262 projects in Australia encompassing 28,300 participants. What are we doing? We are keeping all of those on. In fact, we will be spending $337 million more in CDEP projects over the next four years. Not only will we retain what is there now but we will be opening up about another 54 places each month.

        In the DEETYA area, we will be spending $147 million more over the next four years on education and training compared with the previous four years—a 12 per cent increase in real terms, which I think is pretty handsome indeed. In the native title area, we will be spending $172 million more over the next four years. In addition, I think we should remember that Aborigines themselves will benefit more than average from a range of mainstream budget initiatives, such as the family tax initiative, simply because Aboriginal people tend to be overrepresented in the
        <break page="3852" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        ATSIC are squealing about the cuts, but the cuts are coming off very inflated forward estimates. We have to remember that ATSIC underspent their own budget by $58 million last year, $78 million the previous year and $51 million the year before that. Perhaps they could look to their own budget of $12&amp;half; million on travel and $136.4 million on running costs.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In the region that takes in Dubbo in my electorate, ATSIC have slashed that regional budget by $45 million. I cannot see why it is necessary to slash it by that much. There is a 100 per cent cut to CATARAC, which provides accountancy training, and a 100 per cent cut to the domestic violence unit—a decision by ATSIC themselves—which does marvellous work not only in the Dubbo region but also in all of country New South Wales. It is in these sorts of areas that we should be providing 100 per cent of the outcome levels rather than cutting them by 100 per cent as ATSIC have done when they have arranged their priorities. I do think that this area could be looked at.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sure, there are some cuts in the ATSIC area, but overall they are still being treated very generously indeed. Aboriginal funding will remain a priority of this government over the next term of this parliament.

It represents an act of violence against the welfare system, against aged Australians, against Australian families, against Aboriginal Australians, against the unemployed, against the universities and against the ABC.

         a list had been released of possible budget cuts equal to $20,000 million. That was just part of the softening&amp;hyphen;up process. Budget outlays did not need to be, and would never have been, cut by $20,000 million. In fact, the government's target, as we all recall, was indicated to be a total of $8 billion over the first two years.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The purpose of that exercise being undertaken in that way was so that, when the budget was finally announced and people looked to see how their interests, their concerns, their children, their families and their neighbours were affected by it, they would utter a sigh of relief and say, `It wasn't really as bad as it could've been.' So it was a very successful marketing exercise. In fact, it was so successful that we had people like Malcolm Farr, a very highly regarded political reporter for the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Daily Telegraph
        </emphasis>
        , heading his front page report on the budget in the

        on the following day as `A fair go'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are three elements of the budget to which Mr Farr drew attention and they were highlighted at the top of that article. The first one was tax cuts of $200 a child for middle income families. That was part of the family tax package announced in the budget. The second one was tax incentives to encourage private health insurance. The third one was the 15 per cent surcharge on the super contributions for high income earners.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only one of those three items which has survived is the 15 per cent surcharge on super contributions for high income earners. The family tax cuts have been more than absorbed by the other impositions which have been made as a result of that budget. Various estimates have been made for middle income families where both the husband and the wife work with a combined income of $35,000 to $40,000 and have two children. The additional weekly cost to those families is between $35 and $40.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the first item referred to by Mr Farr—and I am not criticising him—of tax cuts of $200 a child for middle income families, in the budget which he referred to as a fair go, disappears. The second one he referred to was tax incentives to encourage private health
        <break page="3853" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         insurance. We have already heard enough of that. The tax incentives to encourage private health insurance have already been absorbed by the private health funds and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) knew when that announcement was made that that was what was going to happen.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those benefits to assist families and to compensate them for undertaking private health insurance amount to $1.7 billion every year. That was supposed to go, with a firm assurance from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), into the pockets of the workers and into the pockets of families. It went straight into the coffers of the private health funds—$1.7 billion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third point that Mr Farr refers to is the 15 per cent surcharge on super contributions for high income earners. It is probably about time. That includes ourselves, Madam Deputy Speaker. One of the most profitable forms of investment for any people in Australia during their lives is to contribute to superannuation. The taxation benefits which have accrued to them as a result of that have provided them with retirement incomes to which other people—ordinary wage plug Australian families—could never aspire.

But one thing I notice—and everybody needs to keep this in mind as well—is that, when the sons and daughters of ordinary working&amp;hyphen;class families in Australia who have the ability to go to university are not able to find a place, they will find that many of those places to which they aspired

A swing against the government of five per cent will put Labor back into government with a majority of 16 seats.

Logic, instinct, and every hint of self&amp;hyphen;preservation would have suggested that this was madness. Armed only with single&amp;hyphen;shot rifles, bayonets and knives, 800 boys on horses were no match for a heavily fortified town armed with cannons and machine&amp;hyphen;guns.

        You know the rest of the story. Against impossible odds, 800 young Australians helped change the course of the First World War. Their charge was more than courage. It was more than defiance against oppression. It was an act of pure faith in the future—and perhaps our finest illustration of that quality that we call the Australian spirit.

        In an age where closely held beliefs and political ideology are frequently scoffed at, I wish to place on record the principles of modern liberalism that I hold dear.

        The first principle which recognises the rights of the individual was expressed in 1689 by the father of liberalism, John Locke. He wrote that the very substance of government should be the protection of individual rights, including specifically the rights of life, liberty and property. The government's role was to be the custodian for those rights and to protect the individuals in our community. This right to individual growth manifests itself today in our free market economy and in our community's respect for individual attitudes. For example, as a nation we encourage the creation of wealth and we respect free speech, freedom of expression and association. However, along with these individual rights come some community responsibilities.

        The second principle of modern liberalism is a belief in parliamentary democracy. Although historically liberalism and democracy were never close bedfellows, modern liberals do have a genuine commitment to the parliamentary systems. We believe in the Westminster system and all that comes with it, including making the executive more accountable to this parliament. A very good example of this is one of the first decisions of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard): that he, along with all other ministers, should attend every question time in this House. No more part-time responsibility; that is modern liberalism at work.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The third principle of modern liberalism is our belief in reform. Liberalism has traditionally steered a course between the extremism of the far Left and the reactionary conservatism of the far Right. Liberalism is most comfortable when it is developing new ideas and setting new goals. It encourages us to nurture expression in areas like the theatre, music, dance and cinema. It encourages us to excel in sport through better training techniques and improved fitness. It encourages us to succeed in business with better work practices and innovative products. Liberalism has a reformist zeal: to reach higher, to move faster and to grow stronger. This will deliver a society that the greatest Australian Liberal, Sir Robert Menzies, described as a community of lifters and not leaners.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The final finger on the hand of modern liberalism is the classic doctrine of equality of opportunity. In our society status consideration should be irrelevant in determining how successful an individual can be. As political historian Professor Mark Hagopian wrote, in a liberal society achievement criteria such as talent, industry and creativity rather than the ascriptive criteria such as birth should mainly determine one's social position.
       </para>

         In an Australian context this is a formula that is as important a motivation for our workplace reform legislation as it is for us to deny a privilege based on birth right. I reject any born to rule mentality, because it flies in the face of one of our country's most sacrosanct beliefs that we as a people must determine our own future and that we as individuals must shape our own destiny. We cannot afford in our modern and complicated world to tie the hands of our children before they are born, because discrimination from the cradle will lead to discrimination until the grave. Equality of opportunity is a part of modern liberalism that will be most aggressively defended by my Liberal Party. It is the reason why so many of my colleagues in the class of 1996 are here from all parts of Australia. That is what I believe in; that is modern liberalism.

For example, three times more women than men are setting up their own small businesses.

I must support it because it is in line with what the voters of Lindsay wanted when they voted for me and the Liberal Party on 2 March. The seat of Lindsay is made up of a lot of hardworking young families. Sixty per cent of our labour force commutes out of the electorate to work.

        I think it is apt to remind people of the reason why there was such a massive defection in the heartland of Labor in the seat of Lindsay. In the 1995-96 budget, Labor tried to tax the family home with the builders' hardware tax. It was defeated by the Liberal Party. Under the Fraser coalition government, home loan repayments were 19 per cent of the median monthly family income in 1983. Under Labor, they rose to 27 per cent. Under Labor, 24 per cent of all families had no family member employed and more than 600,000 children under 14 were living in families where no-one had a job.

Although the Labor Party might crow about continuous quarters of growth, for the people of Lindsay walking around the markets, walking around the shops and going to spend their wage it has meant very little.

We all know that bankcard rates are 20 per cent and that going loans are 10 per cent. That is basically what happened to Australia when we lost our triple A credit rating—we went from an ordinary loan at 10 per cent to having to pay bankcard rates of 20 per cent.

They just cannot maintain an adequate standard of living. The best we can give them is a drop in interest rates. That is why the people of Lindsay voted for the Liberal Party on 2 March.

That is exceptionally important to the youth of Lindsay.

It is surprising how much defence happens out in greater western Sydney and how many defence people there are who have retired into the area from defence.

That is important because under Labor defence spending was reduced quite severely from nearly 2.3 per cent of GDP down to 1.9 per cent of GDP currently. A lot of allegations have been made that defence did not get cut but in real terms the defence budget has been reduced by 0.5 per cent—but there is hope of maintaining that level of defence funding.

        There is absolutely no doubt that the budget contains cuts which have hurt many Australians. That is not an issue which anyone on either side of the parliament could argue against, although those on the other side would argue that there are reasons for inflicting that pain on Australians.

        It is worth having a look at the Australian government's record over the years when it comes to balancing the budget. The simple fact is that since the Second World War we have only ever had four surplus budgets in this parliament—and it remains to be seen in 12 months what the bottom line of this budget will be. Looking back through the records, you find that those four budgets which were in surplus were in 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990—four Labor budgets. The only surplus budgets since the Second World War were delivered by Labor governments in the Hawke and Keating period.

That is not a black hole in proportional terms; that is a black canyon. So, by international comparison, the budget deficit that this government confronts is one of the lowest. The economic position of the government is strong and the economy that it inherited is strong. The sort of situation the coalition left for Labor in 1983 was three times worse than the current one in relation to the budget deficit.

         The simple fact is high income earners face somewhat of an inconvenience through the possible extra charges for Medicare and higher taxes on superannuation. They are of nuisance value to those people on high in comes. For those people who receive low and middle incomes, the ordinary families of Australia, they face extra charges that are going to affect their lifestyle.

        We are not talking here about matters of convenience; we are talking about the very lifestyle that Australian families are going to be forced to take as a result of the budget measures. The budget will hurt their children's career choices; it will affect the frail parents and the care that they are able to get; it will hurt their children's child-care arrangements; it will hurt their access to job training opportunities; it will hurt their access to help if they are unemployed; and, most importantly, it will reduce their job security.

        This budget contains a forecast on economic growth for the year ahead of just 3&amp;half; per cent. That is lower than the economic growth that we have had over the last four years. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) stands before the parliament and produces a budget which he claims to be proud of, which will produce for this nation the lowest level of economic growth that we have seen in five years. The Liberal Party want to take some comfort out of that. In fact, their own document, budget statement No. 1, includes an interesting assessment of what they think is going to happen to ordinary Australians. When we look at private consumption—that is, the money which ordinary citizens will spend in the year ahead—the budget papers themselves say this:

        This government are introducing a budget with measures that they know will reduce the growth in people's spending power to a level which is lower than the average for the last 20 years; yet they are proud of that. The simple fact is that, over the course of the last couple of budgets, the Labor government was able to see the economy grow in excess of four per cent per year. This government seem content to wind the economy back and see a growth rate around 3&amp;half; per cent.
       </para>

         the employment front. The government's own budget paper forecast unemployment to average 8.5 per cent in the year ahead. That is the same as last year. Given growth rates below four per cent, the expectation of maintaining unemployment at an unacceptably high level of 8&amp;half; per cent is itself very optimistic.

        The simple fact of history and economics of the last decade would tell you that economic growth under four per cent is unlikely to effect any reduction at all on the unemployment rate. When you have economic growth at less than four per cent—and these people are talking about economic growth at 3&amp;half; per cent—you can be sure of one thing: you will not reduce the number of people who are unemployed; you will increase the number of people in Australia who are unemployed. That is what the budget papers show.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst the unemployment rate is expected to average 8&amp;half; per cent, the number of people that the budget papers expect to be unemployed does grow. They also anticipate that there is going to be a reduction in the participation rate. The expectation is that they are going to force people out of the labour market—that is the assumption contained in the budget papers. That prognosis in relation to employment excludes their ideologically driven policies to reduce the public sector, to sack some 30,000 public servants. It also does not include Telstra where we are looking at the prospect of some 20,000 employees of Telstra going over the course of the next couple of years.

        So we have a government which is content to see economic growth slide back to 3&amp;half; per cent; a government which is content to see unemployment rise; a government which is content to see some 30,000 public servants lose their jobs—we have members of the government who stand here before the people of Australia and say that that is a good budget. The saddest thing about this budget is that jobs are clearly no longer a goal of the Australian government. The Liberal government does not see the creation of jobs as its goal in framing the budget, much less a priority. Indeed, it should be the first priority.

        That is not all that surprising, given that the government and the responsible ministers have refused to set any target whatsoever in relation to unemployment reduction. What level of unemployment satisfies the government, they refuse to say. But if you look at the budget papers, it becomes clear that the government is quite happy to see the current situation continue; unlike the previous Labor government where we had in place substantial labour market programs to ensure long-term unemployed people gain the skills they required to re-enter the work force. This government has no such priority; it has no such goal. This budget cuts a whopping $1.8 billion out of the Labor government's job training schemes that we had in place—a whopping $1,800 million.

        The government have virtually destroyed the infrastructure that was in place to assist unemployed people to gain skills and to gain jobs. CES offices are closing. In fact, I have already had two close in my electorate. Last month two CES offices were shut in the federal electorate of Brisbane. One of them, I might say, was in South Brisbane in the heart of an area which has a higher than average level of unemployment. They closed the CES office there last month; they closed the CES office in the city. In the budget we have now learned that they intend to close every CES office and effectively privatise the role that the CES office once played. Along with that, they are quite happy to sack thousands of government workers. That is the greatest failure of this budget.

         There are other decisions that deserve condemnation and in the brief time available I wish to refer to some of them. The government's decision to cut child&amp;hyphen;care funding is going to add somewhere between $14 and $30 per child per week to a family's child&amp;hyphen;care bill. This is a government with a Prime Minister who often tells us that family is important. Yet those people who have families and need child&amp;hyphen;care services are about to face a significant increase in the cost of child care.

         In this budget, the government have also cynically said that they are providing tax benefits for families. In some areas that is true, but I can tell you that what they give you with the left hand they take back plus a bit more with the right hand. If you happen to have children and require child&amp;hyphen;care services then you will, as a result of this budget, face an increase of a minimum of $14 and up to $30 a week.

         I am particularly annoyed and angry that the government has decided to single out community child&amp;hyphen;care centres for attack. Operational grants to community child&amp;hyphen;care centres are to be abolished by this budget. That will directly result in an extra charge for parents of at least $14 per child per week. If you have two children in a community child&amp;hyphen;care centre, the minimum cost to you will be $28 a week extra.

         I have had a number of meetings with parents and administrators in community child&amp;hyphen;care centres in my electorate. Their estimate is that it will be closer to $28 or $30 per child and not $14.

         The cut in tertiary places is going to especially impact upon Queensland where growth places were to be provided. I found it a bit galling to hear some government members in Queensland claim as a great result the decision in this budget to fund some additional tertiary places in Queensland. It is true that additional tertiary places will be funded in Queensland, but there will be 3,000 fewer than we were going to fund—3,000 fewer than the forward estimates would have funded.

         The simple fact is that, no matter how the Liberal propagandists want to twist it and no matter what sort of spin the PR people want to put on it, next year in Queensland there will be 3,000 fewer student places for young Queensland school leavers. That is an attack on Queensland. It is ironic because there was no state in the country that swung more to the Liberal and National parties at the last election than Queensland. What reward did those Queensland voters get for that? They got a slit from ear to ear if they were looking to do tertiary education. There will be 3,000 fewer places for Queensland. That is the Liberal government's thank you to the Queensland electorate that overwhelmingly decided to vote conservative.

To put it simply, if you want to become a lawyer or a doctor then you had better have a mummy or a daddy who is a lawyer or a doctor.

          One of the other more obscure decisions which I found intriguing with the tertiary sector is the cut to Austudy, but particularly the decision to increase the independent living age. It has been raised to 25 years in this budget—a retrograde step. That means that if you are 24 years of age and you want a tertiary education then the Liberal Party thinks that you should still be living with mummy and daddy and mummy and daddy should be able to pay. Your parents' income is going to continue to be assessed as the basis of your eligibility for Austudy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It gets worse. If you start a course below the age of 25 your parental income is assessed not just when you are 24, it is assessed for the remainder of that course of study. If at the age of 24 you enrol for law, medicine, arts, science or anything else, at the age of 27, when you are still at university, the Liberal Party thinks you should still be living with mummy and daddy. The parental income will still apply to you when you are 27 years old.

         <para first-indent="16">
          That is not fanciful, particularly in relation to medicine. If, perchance, someone from a low&amp;hyphen;income family does manage to get into medicine—it is considered as a second degree course—it means that people will be commencing that course no earlier than 21 or 22 years of age and it is quite possible that people will be starting medicine at the age of 23 or 24. When they are 28 years old the Liberal Party says, `No, you are not living independently, mummy and daddy are still paying your way.' That is fine if mummy and daddy happen to be rich. It is not too good if you come from an ordinary working class family.

         —The Howard government's first budget is strong and fair and spreads the burden of addressing the Beazley black hole of $10 billion inherited from the previous government. This year the government will spend nearly as much in interest payments on our government debt as we spend on the defence budget or on the education budget. Nearly $10 billion goes simply to pay interest on the national government credit card. This is a stark depiction of the situation facing our nation as we head towards the new century.
        </para>

       <para first-indent="16">
        Only six years ago the Commonwealth government debt stood at $17 billion. Today it stands at $96 billion. In one year as Treasurer and five years as Prime Minister, Paul Keating added $80 billion to the Commonwealth overdraft. If the Labor Party had their way, we would add to that figure, with the ongoing deficit, about $10 billion each year, such is the massive burden which future taxpayers must inevitably bear.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="3872" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         It is the legacy of the Keating government: high deficit, spiralling debt, rubbery figures and unfunded generosity, where fiscal respon sibility came a distant second to political patronage and payments to the noisiest interest groups. If ever there was a time for a fundamental rethink of the role and operation of the federal government in Australia, it is now. In the last 30 years the size and scope of the government in Australia has grown steadily. In 1960 the federal government's spending amounted to 17 per cent of GDP, whereas today the federal government's spending has risen to 27 per cent of GDP.

        More than one-third of that government spending is on welfare and social security. Australians are increasingly aware that bigger government has not found solutions to their lives in the suburbs or in rural Australia. In fact, it is part of the problem. Extensive government provision of goods and services has contributed to a culture of dependence and entitlement. The incentive for individuals to save and provide for the costs of health care, loss of employment, children's education, future retirement and even nursing home entry has been eroded by poorly targeted government assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Government generosity has allowed people to believe that these contingencies will be substantially funded by the taxpayer. Is it any wonder that household savings have fallen from 15 per cent of disposable income some 20 years ago to three per cent today? Is it any wonder that the proportion of Australians with private health insurance has fallen from 70 per cent in 1972 to under 39 per cent today? Should we be surprised that the cost of pharmaceutical subsidies to the Australian taxpayer has risen by nearly 10 per cent a year?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Government outlays and Medicare benefits are rising by about four per cent a year in real terms, not just monetary terms. Our nation faces a challenge. It is a challenge which this government has chosen to confront head on in this budget. This budget reverses Labor's legacy of deficit and debt. There is nothing compassionate about spending money you do not have, as the Cain government found in Victoria. There is nothing clever or innovative about ignoring fundamental fiscal problems while they further deteriorate.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Howard government's plan will return the budget to surplus within three years without raising income tax, sales tax, petrol excise or company tax. Small business will gain from capital gains tax exemption when the business is sold to buy another similar enterprise or to provide for retirement. The provisional tax uplift factor has already been lowered to six per cent, giving a $180 million tax break to small businesses from July this year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The health system will gain from tax rebates up to $450 per year for families and $125 for singles who take out private health insurance to take the strain off public hospital waiting lists. Low and middle income families with young children will gain an extra $200 per child per year in tax rebates. Single income families with a child under five will gain an extra $500 per year in tax breaks. Up to $50 per fortnight will flow from the Commonwealth budget back into the family budget where it will be more wisely spent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This budget puts parents and individuals ahead of the bureaucracy. It will provide real and lasting benefits to a broad range of Australians, sustainable growth, low interest rates, greater job opportunities in small business and no new taxes as well as a real incentive for individuals to save to contribute to health care, tertiary education, pharmaceutical costs and nursing home entry. It will put an emphasis back on personal responsibility and on moving away from the culture of entitlement and dependency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The budget strengthens the family unit, sparks investor confidence and gets small business moving ahead and employing people. It has been made possible by spending cuts of $4.4 billion this year and a further $7.2 billion next year. Savings have been made in running costs, tightening the activity test for unemployment benefits, redirecting labour market programs and introducing a two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period for migrants to receive unemployment benefits. High income earners will contribute through a 15 per cent surcharge on superannuation contributions and a clampdown on tax avoidance. A Medicare surcharge
         <break page="3873" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          for those high income earners who do not take out private health care will also be instituted.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The need for these spending reductions is clearly illustrated by the sheer size of the recent deficits run by the former government. In 1995-96 the Labor government ran a $10.3 billion deficit. As a result of the Howard government's fiscal strategy the deficit will be reduced to $5.6 billion in 1996-97, and will move into surplus in two years time.

         Those in the ALP, the union movement and the compassion industry who oppose cuts to government spending implicitly support the policy of asking future generations to pay for our government benefits. As Alan Wood said in today's

         One of the most important inputs into the budget debate has been the National Commission of Audit, which reported in June of this year. The commission was chaired by Professor Bob Officer and consisted of Elizabeth Alexander of Price Waterhouse, John Fraser of SBC Brinson and Maurice Newman of Bain and Co. The executive officer of the commission was Geoff Carmody of Access Economics.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The commission imagined what government would look like if it truly worked for the people in the most efficient and cost effective way it could. It started from three basic principles: governments need to act efficiently; improving efficiency is preferable to cutting assistance to those in genuine need; and well managed government contributes to a more competitive economy. These are commonsense principles with which all Australian taxpayers would agree. The simple fundamental questions which the commission asked each area of government activity were: is this a legitimate role for government; if so,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          which level of government; and is this activity being conducted in the most efficient manner?
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The commission pointed to policy areas where the role for government is highly questionable. In several areas they found government activities could be performed by the private sector and should be privatised or contracted out. In other areas there is extensive overlap and duplication between the federal and state governments. This has meant that the federal and state bureaucrats often duplicate effort in performing effectively the same function.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It becomes difficult for citizens to know which level of government is responsible for particular decisions, which level of government deserves the credit or the blame for particular outcomes and which particular government has put up taxes or should take the credit for lowering taxes. There is widespread scope for cost shifting, such as in health where often the states find ways to transfer outpatient expenses onto Medicare.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Across a whole range of areas, the commission advocated a handing over of responsibilities from the Commonwealth to the states. The commission further recommended that governments retreat from their role as service providers. They should concentrate on making policy decisions and funding services rather than actually providing them. For example, it suggested that university operating grants be given in the form of scholarships straight to students, who would then make a decision on which university they would attend. Universities would then be adaptable and responsive to student needs in a competitive market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is not about ideology; it is simply about the efficiency that taxpayers are entitled to expect from government funded services. Governments will need to provide services with greater efficiency if they are to continue to provide them in the future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In some areas, the Commonwealth will have difficulty meeting the expectations of the community. The impact of the ageing population on expenditures in health, social security and aged care areas will be a major challenge. The commission observed:

        <break page="3874" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Action will be necessary to moderate expectations about what support the Commonwealth Government can reasonably be expected to provide and to strengthen incentives for self help by those who can afford it.

          The commission went on to estimate that spending on health care will increase from eight per cent of GDP to over 12 per cent of GDP in the next 50 years—equating it to a $15 billion increase. The age pension will be more difficult to fund for baby boomer retirees, who will make up 25 per cent of the population by the year 2041.

          The commission has also pointed to the extensive non-cash benefits which both pensioners and the unemployed receive and the potential disincentive which they produce for many to more actively seek employment. For example, the commission estimated that in 1993-94 the total of non-cash entitlements given to the unemployed was an average of $90 per week—and every member of this House would be fully aware of the impact of that non-cash estimate. This is aside from the $21,938 in cash benefits which the commission found would be paid to an unemployed family with young children. Those figures are most evident to members of this House who deal with that particular problem.

          These non-cash benefits add up to an extra $158 a week for sole parents. It is estimated that the value of non-cash benefits to sole parents actually outstrips the value of the main government pension paid. The real value of both cash and non-cash benefits has clearly risen in the last 10 years, according to the commission's analysis. The benefits available to pensioners and the unemployed represent a disincentive to find work or save for retirement.

         —This is a somewhat smaller audience than that for my last budget speech. I rise to support the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996&amp;hyphen;97 moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The government has claimed three basic virtues for this budget: it is an exceptionally honest budget, it is an economically essential budget, and it is a fair budget. None of these contentions has any validity.

         With regard to budget honesty, I note that, although the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his speech made much of budget honesty, this is a most dishonest budget. The fundamental dishonesty is the basic presumption of this budget that, because the estimated underlying budget outcome for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 is $9 billion greater than was forecast in the 1995 budget, Australia has a major fiscal problem that was left by the previous government and which a responsible government must address by substantial fiscal tightening. That is a patently ludicrous proposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The undeniable fact is that Australia's budgetary position is one of the best in the Western world. The latest OECD statistics for July show that Australia's budget deficit for 1995 was the equal third lowest of the top 20 OECD countries. For 1996&amp;hyphen;97 it was projected to be the equal second lowest, and that was before this budget was produced. So if we had a severe budget problem before this budget, the finance ministers in most of the other OECD countries should have been slashing their wrists.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Likewise with government debt: even though it increased significantly in the first half of the 1990s as a result of the recession, it is still at very low levels compared with most other OECD countries. The latest OECD figures show that, of the 17 countries for which information is available, Australia's government debt is the fourth lowest. At 29 per cent of GDP, it is 18 per cent of GDP below the OECD average.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nor were we likely to increase our debt burden in the foreseeable future. The budget papers show that, without any of the fiscal tightening contained in this budget, Commonwealth government debt as a percentage of GDP would decline over the period to the end of the century. So we have a comparatively low level of government debt, and it is not on an increasing path. So much for the Treasurer's oft repeated claim that we were on a path of deficit and debt into the next century.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that, by the standards set by the European Union for entry into its single currency arrangement, Australia passed the test of fiscal rectitude with flying colours. The
         <break page="3876" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          fiscal standard set by the European Union under the Maastricht treaty is for the budget deficit to be less than three per cent of GDP and the government debt to be less than 60 per cent of GDP. Currently, only tiny Luxembourg meets that standard—not Germany, not France, not Britain, certainly not Italy or any of the other 15 EU countries. But Australia easily met the standard before this budget.

         The Commonwealth budget deficit for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 on a no policy change basis was only $3.4 billion, or 0.6 per cent of GDP, compared with the Maastricht treaty target of three per cent. Even taking our underlying budget deficit, which is not the Maastricht concept, our no policy change deficit of 1.9 per cent of GDP for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 was comfortably within the Maastricht target, as was our level of government debt. So where is the drastic budgetary problem Australia is supposed to be facing according to this government?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clearly, by the standards of comparable countries we do not have a budgetary problem, and we do not have a government debt problem. For all this government's talk of increasing deficit and debt and budget black holes, the fact is that Labor left this country in good fiscal shape—much better than most other Western countries, and much better than that which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) left us in 1983 when the budget deficit he handed Labor was five per cent of GDP, or over $25 billion in today's dollars.

         The fact is the budget crisis that this government would have the electorate believe it is battling to overcome does not exist, but the government wants to generate a crisis mentality in the community so as to falsely denigrate the previous government and to give it the cover to do what it has always wanted to do; that is, to slash the public sector; to slash programs that assist people in need; to slash expenditure on various bodies that they have a special distaste for, like the ABC and ATSIC—in short, to give effect to the full panoply of conservative prejudices and predilections that were first paraded in Fightback.

          altered in various ways to maximise the appearance of a budget problem. The budget papers for this year do not include the international comparisons of our budgetary and government debt positions that were included in previous years because, as I have already shown, they would contravene the government's attempts to portray Australia as having a serious budgetary problem.

         Also, the government falsely portrays the underlying budget outcome as the actual budget outcome, thus the Treasurer says on page 1 of his budget speech:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The budget outcome for the past year was a deficit of $10.3 billion. If we took no corrective measures it would be $9.6 billion this year.
        </para>
        <para>
         These figures are not the budget outcome at all. The actual budget outcome for 1995-96 was a deficit of $5,045 million; that is, about half the figure given by the Treasurer. The forecast actual budget outcome for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 is not a deficit at all. It is a surplus of $464 million, which is forecast to grow to a surplus of $6,638 million in 1997-98. But these figures, of course, are not mentioned by the Treasurer in his speech because they would not fit with his fiscal crisis rhetoric.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The figures the Treasurer gave were for the underlying budget outcome, which is the actual budget outcome minus net advances, which comprise principally proceeds of sales of government enterprises and repayments of debt by the states. This attempt to portray the underlying budget outcome as the budget outcome is most insidious. The underlying concept is no more than an analytical tool, as it is with the consumer price index. Treasury has long calculated an underlying CPI, but it is not portrayed as the CPI outcome. If it is misused in this way, then the underlying budget outcome will be seen as just the `lying' budget outcome.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, as part of this underhanded attempt to portray the underlying budget outcome as the budget outcome, the budget papers give little information on the actual budget outcome. Mostly they refer to the underlying balance with the actual or headline budget balance reduced to a memorandum item. Thus the budget outcome data for all the years back to 1960 is given in terms of the underlying
         <break page="3877" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          balance with no detail given for the actual budget outcome, as has been done in previous years' budget papers.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This, again, is a totally outrageous misuse of the underlying concept. This attempt to portray the underlying budget outcome as the budget outcome is not what other countries do, as the Secretary to the Treasury admitted in an address last week.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Furthermore, there is no clear line between the actual outcome and the underlying outcome in terms of their impact on national savings, government debt or pressure on financial markets. For instance, the proceeds of asset sales do not add to national savings in the same way as most tax increases or expenditure cuts do. They do, nevertheless, reduce the government's borrowings, and so reduce pressure on financial markets from government borrowings, and also reduce the level of government debt below what it would otherwise be. But the government wants to claim the need for a tough budget to reduce government debt whilst ignoring the reduction of debt coming from asset sales.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Furthermore, not all expenditure cuts or tax increases add to national savings, thus expenditure cuts to the states, which are $1.6 billion for general purpose payments, and further large cuts in specific purpose payments do not of themselves add to national savings. Also, increased taxes on superannuation do not add to national savings, yet this is worth another $1.5 billion in this budget. So the underlying budget balance does not give an accurate picture of the additions to savings flowing from the budget or of the impact on government debt. Therefore, to use this as the budget outcome to the exclusion of the actual budget outcome is to dishonestly present the budget outcome.

         In relation to broken promises, it is remarkable that in a budget which loudly proclaims the virtue of budget honesty there are myriad broken election promises. By the time the Treasurer finished his budget speech, he was knee deep in broken promises—in fact, $17 billion worth. It requires a particularly thick hide to simultaneously break promises on a wholesale scale and claim the virtue of unprecedented budget honesty. But this Treasurer
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          has shown he has a hide of truly rhinoceros proportions. This utterly cynical approach to campaign promises has been made even more squalid by the post-election attempt to distinguish promises on the basis of their being core or non-core.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, in respect of one broken promise, the government does not justify it as being non-core. It just baldly denies it has been broken. I refer to the now Treasurer's oft repeated specific election promise on taxation, which was not to increase any tax or to introduce any new tax. This clear promise has been utterly and undeniably broken by the general increase in the Medicare levy, the increase in the Medicare levy for higher income earners, the increase in the sales tax on government-owned private-plated cars, the increase in tax on superannuation for higher income earners, the increase in tax on imported goods through a reduction in the tariff concession system and the policy by&amp;hyphen;law, and the increase in company tax for firms engaging in research and development through a reduction in the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These measures are worth $853 million this year and almost $5 billion over four years, yet this Treasurer keeps maintaining he has not broken his promise. Thus, on the ABC radio program

          PM

         on 29 August, the Treasurer, in claiming he had eschewed revenue measures in the budget, said that `it was like the dog that didn't bark'—and the dog that did not bark was the tax dog. This is just blatant denial of the undeniable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clearly, along with a lot of other canine utterances on budget night, we all heard the very loud bark of the tax dog. The supposed justification we have been given for this welter of broken promises is the difference of $9 billion in the current forecast for the underlying budget deficit for 1996-97 on a no policy change basis from that which was assessed at the time of the 1995 budget. But here again there is more budget dishonesty.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No attempt has been made by the government to explain why there is this difference. All we are told is that increased outlays from decisions by the former government account for $0.6 billion of this difference and the rest
         <break page="3878" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          is due to parameter and other variations. Surely, since so much is being made of this difference, the government had a responsibility to say why this had occurred. But what is clear is that a substantial factor in this difference is the lower rate of inflation that occurred in 1995-96, and is now forecast for 1996-97, compared with the forecast for inflation in the 1995 budget.
         </break>

         But why should lower inflation require a tightening of budgetary policy? Lower inflation is a good economic outcome. It is not evidence of some policy failure; it is what we want to achieve. Also, lower inflation is of itself a positive for national savings. High inflation clearly has been a factor in Australia's poor private savings performance in the past. It is not some adverse development to have low inflation that requires corrective action.

         Likewise, reduced forecasts for employment growth, especially for this year, have meant that employment is now expected to be about 120,000 less in 1996-97 than was forecast in the 1995 budget. This means that outlays on unemployment benefits will be much higher than previously projected. But what sense does it make to react to lower employment by substantially tightening fiscal policy thereby further reducing employment growth, or by slashing expenditure on labour market programs, or by cutting unemployment benefit entitlements or other programs of great assistance to the unemployed?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Instead of blaming and attacking the victims, what we need to redress higher unemployment is higher economic growth. That would create more jobs and reduce the budget deficit by increasing revenue and reducing expenditure on unemployment benefits.

         But this budget does the reverse. It reduces economic growth. The budget papers admit that, even allowing for questionable offsetting confidence effects, the effect of the budget is a small net contractionary impact on activity in 1996-97. So on its face this budget reduces economic growth and therefore increases unemployment above what it would otherwise be. The number of unemployment beneficiary recipients is expected to grow from 802,000 last year to 829,000 this year. Employment

         Indeed, what is absolutely clear from this budget is that this government has, at the first available opportunity, run up the white flag on unemployment.

They expect to create only 440,000 additional jobs in the next three years, compared with 666,000 additional jobs in the previous three years, which means they expect to create 226,000 fewer jobs in three years than were created in the previous three years under Labor's policies.

         It is much the same with economic growth. Their forecast for economic growth over the next three years is for markedly slower growth than Labor achieved in the three years to 1995-96.

For the three years 1996-97 to 1998-99 this budget forecasts economic growth which is never above 3&amp;half; per cent in a year and which amounts to only 10.6 per cent over the three years—that is, 2.3 per cent less than in the previous three years.

Only a small percentage of the $4 billion or so would be saved if paid as a normal tax cut whereas, if paid as a matching contribution to super, all of it would be saved.

          So what an irony. Here we have the government breaking scores of promises, attacking people in need, destroying or impairing essential programs and ripping the heart out of Australia's already small public sector all in the supposed cause of increased national savings, while simultaneously sabotaging the greatest boost to private and national savings ever put in place in the history of this country.

          A responsible approach to this budget would have required fully costed promises at the last election, which Labor made but the coalition did not; a continuance of the process of fiscal consolidation, which Labor put in place despite the opposition's attempts to stop us; maintaining a pace of fiscal consolidation that did not impede economic or employment growth; taking a much tougher approach on tax avoidance, especially in relation to very wealthy people and people avoiding tax by contract employment arrangements and use of interposed entities; not slashing worthwhile programs or attacking people in need; and fully supporting the super arrangements announced last year. That would really have given us an honest, economically responsible and fair budget.

         With the pre-budget clamouring by union leaders, who appear to believe they have the mandate to set policy for all Australians, along with the cries of foul and poverty from the opposition, my electorate office was geared for a flood of calls from alarmed constituents. But we did not start to get the calls of alarm until after the opposition had rifled through the budget documents searching desperately for something—anything—to hold up as a version of a disaster. Then I spoke with a tearful full&amp;hyphen;age pensioner who had been told that she would be charged an entry fee contribution to enter a nursing home. This disgraceful lie did not come from a member of the coalition.

         Sadly for this country, instead of an opposition which scrutinises government policy to come up with constructive criticism, all we have had is scaremongering and misrepresentation of the facts. This has been most evident in the nursing home reform, which, coupled with the minister's aged care structural reform package, has been well received in my electorate—and for good reason.

          As I had visited several nursing homes leading up to the budget, it came as no news to me that 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds. Nor was I surprised to learn that 75 per cent of our nursing homes do not meet our most basic Australian building standards. But what was of greatest concern was the number of hostel beds being used for nursing home patients. These patients were having to do with unsatis factory facilities—bathrooms not big enough to take wheelchairs, stairs instead of ramps and other similar inequities. The hostel proprietors in my electorate have worked hard caring for all their residents but are suffering from the results of the patch-up job of the last 13 years. While money has been thrown at the problem, not enough time or expertise has been spent resolving the cause.

I am pleased to report that they are more than happy with this budget initiative and are anxious to get the new programs under way. Hostel beds which have been vacant can finally be converted to desperately needed nursing home beds. The introduction of an entry contribution for those who can afford to pay will help towards creating a more economically viable nursing home system to support those who cannot pay.

         Let us get back to that vital telephone graph. Of major interest in my community was the school to work scheme. As it is such a new and innovative program, it did need some explaining. One of my first meetings was at the Balmoral State High School. The principal, Lesley Englert, is a woman of vision and a dedicated educator. She had honed in on our increase in funding and commitment to the literacy and numeracy strategy. Her first question was how she could tap into this to advance the program she already had up and running at her school. Her concern was that we did not forget the high school students who need help.

          We took a long hard look at the statistics. At some secondary schools in my electorate, an alarming 25 per cent of grade 10 students do not pass the standard literacy and numeracy test. This means that they cannot go on to take the Board of Secondary Study course—the precursor for tertiary education. It also means that they do not have adequate reading and writing skills to move easily into the business world and are destined for the unemployment circuit. Fortunately, 95 per cent of these students stay on to do year 11 and 12, and this is when principals like Lesley Englert work at improving their liter acy and numeracy using TAFE literacy modules.

         I believe that we must expand our literacy and numeracy program to the high schools or we will continue to allow a forgotten generation to enter the work force without these basic skills, skills which are their educational birthright. The fact that Labor had made no provision to continue this program was a disgrace. We need to reassure the parents, teachers and the secondary school students themselves that, after 13 years of being ignored by the Labor government, help is on the way. As a result of our budget policy all students, primary and secondary, should be able to read, write, spell and communicate with ease and assurance. Besides our literacy and numeracy strategy, school principals I have spoken with are enthusiastic about the school to work strategy. Already, several have suggested we organise meetings with local business people and other relevant organisations to get the best advantage possible for students.

         Another response I had about the budget came from parents I met at Villanova College, a private school in my electorate. Breaking the mind&amp;hyphen;set that the unemployment benefit is a salary paid to school leavers was a point on which they were most vocal. After 13 years of welfare democracy, we now see a second generation of school leavers who expect to live on government welfare rather than income earned. There is a ground swell of belief in my electorate that this can be turned around only if we assist small business to recover and general employment. That brings us to this vital section of the community. We have put in place a 100&amp;hyphen;day action plan. We have abandoned Labor's proposal to force subcontractors into the PAYE net. We have created an economic benefit from the capital gains tax and we have reduced the provisional tax uplift factor.

          My electorate contains a wide range of small business. Many of these are in the retail trade and many in the service industry. A survey I completed prior to the budget showed that just over 50 per cent of all small business in the Griffith electorate are two&amp;hyphen; to five&amp;hyphen;person operations. On further investiga tion I found these were mainly a husband and wife team, who could not take a holiday together unless they closed up the shop. On even closer study I found that most of this large group in our community could not afford to take on a third employee and in every case—and I must repeat in every case—we were told this was partly because of the unfair dismissal law.

         It stands to reason that a small business of just two people must be doing reasonably well to be able to employ a third person. But it is also glaringly obvious that if this person proves to be dishonest, dishonourable or a disadvantage to that small business they cannot keep that person for the up to nine months it currently takes to go through the dismissal procedure. While there are many other elements of the new workplace bill to be considered, this one I believe has the undivided support of the business community.

         I can only presume that those in the Senate who are blocking this legislation have not spent time with the small business operators in their community.

They had been caught red-handed in a scam which had resulted in the theft of more than $200,000 worth of goods from her business. Her profit for the first six months of this year has already been spent on defending the unfair dismissal case. This employer did not set out to treat her staff unfairly. She followed all the rules and guidelines set down by the unions and the Industrial Relations Commission.

It became obvious within days of the Treasurer's budget speech that we had to get the truth out into the community to offset the innuendo and, in many cases, the straight&amp;hyphen;out lies being peddled by those who are not genuine in their effort and their concern for the future of Australians.

         As a result we have had excellent feedback from schools, hostels, nursing homes and community organisations such as the Queensland Carers Association. This large welfare organisation came to me prior to the budget saying they believed they had received less than a fair deal under Labor. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) involved the Carers Association of Australia in its budget planning and, as a result, the Queensland Carers Association now has three programs undergoing trials.

The regional seats held by the Liberal and National Party members have become the forgotten electorates of this nation. When John Howard moved his office to Sydney the ominous signs were there that this government would govern primarily for metropolitan Australia, and this budget confirms that Australians living outside Sydney and other capital cities have become second&amp;hyphen;class citizens under this government, represented by absentee landlords, coalition landlords, who, like their leader, John Howard, believe that Australia stops at the outskirts of Sydney and other state capital cities.

There have been few other statements in the House since the March election which rival Minister Sharp's statement of betrayal.

         —I am delighted tonight to rise to address Appropriation Bill (No. 1), the budget. The budget brought down by the new Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the first Howard government is a fair budget. It is a fair budget and, as the Treasurer says, it addresses deficit and debt. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) is leaving in a great hurry. I sat here and listened to his contribution to this debate with, I must admit, some amazement and alacrity. The overblown hyperbole and the rhetoric was absolutely staggering. This was from a bloke who sat on this side of the House for 13 years while his political party was in government. He watched Treasurer after Treasurer come into this place and tell us how tomorrow would be full of nirvana. The world's problems were solved because the Treasurer had brought down another fantastic budget.

        What happened? Here we are, 13 years later, saddled with incredible international debt, with a current account that continues to flow on and on in deficit, year after year. Debt builds upon debt. The member for Corio seems to think that we will achieve national significance, that we will achieve a better lifestyle for all Australians, if we continue to spend our children's pay cheques some time after the year 2000—perhaps even after the year 2010. It is long past the time that we should have got the household budget in order.

         some hope to Australia. Despite the overblown rhetoric of the member for Corio, I have to say that the Australian public has warmed to this budget. They are happy with the budget because, finally, someone is taking the lead to address our overspending problem.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We hear a lot in this place about the current account. I am not sure that everybody in Australia knows what the current account deficit is. I doubt seriously that, if I talked to my two daughters and my son, they could tell me in technical terms what the current account deficit is. Here is just a little bit of layman's economics. There are two factors of the current account that affect us and that are relevant to the debate here tonight.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first is savings. If, year after year, the government spends more than it gains in income, it cannot balance its budget. Do you know what happens then? Say you have got a Visa card, a Diner's Club card, an American Express card or a Bankcard. If you spend this month the total sum of your income next month, you will have difficulty eating, will you not? It is difficult to draw a cheque to find the money to meet the bills next month. So what do you do? You incur debt. That means that you have to pay interest. That is what is happening to us.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Part of the current account deficit problem is a savings problem. The Australian government is drawing on savings—private sector savings—it is eating up those savings, by irresponsibly running into debt. So half of our current account problem is due to the fact that we have to pay interest year after year on our borrowings, with expenditure being greater than the amount we have coming in.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The other half of the current account problem has to do with international trade. It was true for a very long time that Australia was a very wealthy country. For a long time we exported more than we imported. Those years were years where the international community was willing to pay relatively high prices for our commodities compared with the prices paid for manufactured goods or services. Unfortunately, Australia and other countries who are producers of primary commodities—whether they be minerals from the ground or agricultural commodities makes no differ ence—earn less today than they did 10 or 20 years ago relative to other items in the international traded economy.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In recent times, we have been able to increase our exports of manufactured goods. That has been very positive. But we still have this huge net trade deficit in the manufacturing sector, including industries which manufacture chemicals and plastics and petroleum products—process industries. You can only keep running those for so long, because you keep building up debt on debt on debt, and you have to pay the interest on the bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The solution to our problems is twofold. Firstly, we should not draw on Australia's savings; we should spend only the money which the government receives. That is what this budget sets out to do. Secondly, we should encourage industry to develop so that we sell more of our services, more of our manufactured goods and more of our process industry goods overseas. The budget also addresses this issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first part of the savings issue is simple for most of us to understand. When the Treasurer brought down the budget, he was trying to put us in balance three years from now. The second part is the balance of trade. On this side of the House we are attempting to provide solutions to the trade imbalance problem through several mechanisms, the first of which is reform of our antiquated, archaic industrial relations laws, which has been part of the agenda on this side of the House since, really, 1984.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I listen to the rhetoric of Bill Kelty and Jennie George of the ACTU, it reminds me of the overblown 1950s rhetoric of class division, warfare, deprivation, hardship and all those things that this government through this modest industrial relations `reform' or modernisation proposal is hoping to tackle. We need to bring Australia not just into the 20th century but into the 21st century, and that is what the workplace reform bill attempts.

        We are trying to negotiate with the Australian Democrats in the Senate. It is hopeless trying to negotiate with the Australian Labor Party in the Senate; they have foreshadowed over 200 amendments—and the shadow minister for trade, the member for Canberra

        The Labor Party kept changing the industrial relations environment, it kept changing the regulations and it kept changing the 1988 bill. But now, all of a sudden, it cannot be changed any more. Paul Keating, in 1993 after he won the unwinnable election, the one he should not have won, went down to Melbourne on 21 April and gave a speech to the Institute of Company Directors. He said, amongst other things, `We have to modernise this system. We need to reduce this antiquated awards system from hundreds of thousands of provisions down to a few core, basic provisions, as a safety net, if you will, and let all the rest of the matters go to bargaining between companies and individuals or companies and their collective bargaining agents. We need to make it easier for people to work together to create solutions that are satisfactory to them, that do not treat all industry commonly.'

Because there were no incentives to drive it and because a few people at the top decided they knew better than everybody else. That is like going back to the beginning of my argument about this budget. Do you members of the Australian Labor Party who sit in this minute, insignificant, irrelevant opposition in this House of Representatives really think you know better than I do how to spend my money? I do not think so. And I do not think, deep at heart, you do either, but you have to keep running the line because you do not know what else to talk about.

        You know you were deficient in not addressing the budget deficit problem a long time ago, after the recession we did not have to have—Paul Keating's recession we did not need. As we started coming out of that, the then Treasurer was very slow to move interest rates down to let the economy open up again. He forgot about the fact that perhaps he
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         should start withdrawing some of the spending. The economy started to lift as productivity improved and the gross domestic product grew as we produced more, as we became more active and provided more jobs. But what did the government do? It spent more money quickly, as much and as fast as possible.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Talk about irresponsible: look at the lead&amp;hyphen;up to this most recent election. The then Minister for Employment, Education and Training was so paranoid about trying to artificially reduce the level of unemployment in Australia that he went out and spent a whole year's blessed budget in less than nine months on Working Nation. And the Working Nation programs, I can tell you, were bloated and overblown to begin with.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Working Nation propositions simply said that we have a serious unemployment problem which we need to address, that we need to do something to bring down the numbers of long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed. Admirable sentiments. No disagreement from me ever. The long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed are some of the most disadvantaged people that we could have in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But international studies have shown that spending heaps of taxpayers' money, heaps of public money on programs, programs, programs to advantage the people who are disadvantaged, does not work. Read the OECD studies. Read all of the international studies. It has never worked anywhere in the world. The only thing that has ever worked is if you go and pay employers to hire people. That works to some extent; but all the other stuff does not.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the Working Nation budget was overblown to begin with. DEET was absolutely flush with money. Everywhere you went there was money for programs, initiatives or things you could tender on. It was so awash with money all over the place that it was an absolute embarrassment. And you expect us, knowing this from opposition, to sit here and continue to waste Australians' money in such a ridiculous fashion. I tell you what, there is no way known that I could be party to continuing such an absolute fraud on the Australian people.

       <break page="3889" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we intend to change the industrial relations environment. We intend to continue to let it evolve, to let it go down the path that the former Prime Minister indeed set as a pathway for Australia and one with which we never disagreed. So the things that you argue about in the Senate and the things about which we are now trying to convince the Independents and the Democrats are naturally progressive items in the reform of our workplace relations in Australia. They are simply aimed at letting employers and employees themselves decide things that affect their companies away from the central planning regime that never worked.

         Another one of the catchcries of economists that we hear constantly in this place and which you read about in the press in Australia—I have never seen this in the press anywhere else in the world—is the concept of micro-economic reform. Do you know what that is, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio? Of course you do. We all know what micro-economic reform means because we have had it stamped onto our foreheads. It is something like a branding iron which says, `Micro&amp;hyphen;economic—I'm for that.' Everybody is for it. How many people really know what it means?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a pretty simple concept. It simply means that we need to improve the efficiency of our utilities such as the electricity, natural gas and water supplies. We need to improve the efficiency of our transport industry—road transport, rail transport and air transport. We need to improve the efficiency of our waterfront and our coastal shipping operations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why do we need to improve these things? We are an island nation. We are down in the Pacific and we are dependent on the rest of the world. We are not really all alone down here. There are 18 million of us in this huge country. We are a wealthy nation, no fear. We are one of the most powerful nations on earth notwithstanding our very small population. Why? Because Australians have been willing to work hard—it is true that we are hard workers—because we are intelligent, because we believe in education, because we believe in fairness and equity and because we are one of the world's greatest democracies.

We say, `We want some of your money.' The Commissioner of Taxation demands that you give it to him. Those in the middle ground, the PAYE employees, frequently do not have a lot of opportunity to evade the net of the Commissioner of Taxation. They pay their taxes, he takes their money and then we in this place turn around and give it back to them. How stupid are we? I ask you: how dumb is that?

        I want to speak in this debate about some particular aspects of this budget. Of course I will not have time to cover all the matters included in the amendment because it is very comprehensive. My central approach is: this is a budget that will stall the economy, will divide society and will limit our sense of nationhood. Taken with the litany of broken promises in this budget, it constitutes a budget of deceit, despair and division.

        Let me go through those points in sequence. With regard to stalling the economy, I indicate that that point has been made effectively by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in their contributions in this debate. In one sense it is not even a matter of contention. The

        Let us assume for the moment that the government's proposals are right with what they have established and claimed is a prescription for slowing the economy, for slowing growth, and in particular employment growth, in an economy with 8&amp;half; per cent unemployment. When you look at it, the only possible assessment of the macro-economic consequences of this budget is that, first and on the surface, it withdraws the stimulus by pulling money out of the economy which, by every element of any form of macro-economic analysis, will slow the rate of growth. The budget papers reflect that, and the Treasury analysis reflected in the budget papers reflects and accepts that.

        But indirectly the situation is worse—and this is why I am concerned that the growth might be even less than that forecast in the budget papers. The ways in which government has a capacity, apart from its macro-economic management role, to have a positive effect on economic growth immediately, and more particularly in the medium term, is through the education and training of its

And this is a budget with bad news on all those fronts.

        The message on education is crystal clear: having the opportunity to access the best tertiary education that Australia can offer—that access which Australians had come to accept as being available for their children, wherever they were born, whatever their parents' status—will no longer be the case; we are moving towards a two-tier education system. But that has been pretty well clearly established by a number of speakers. We have had the problem compounded by the absurd decisions made with regard to research and development in this budget with the slashing of private sector research and development in this country—the very opposite of the objective we should be seeking. We find no positive aspects with regard to Australian infrastructure and a substantial cut in road funding—quite contrary in all those three instances to election promises.

        But for a moment I wish to focus on the fourth area that I mentioned with regard to the role of government in stimulating growth—particularly in Australia, when one of the keys to sustained growth is the way in which we cope with our current account deficit—and that is this budget's cuts to assistance for exporters. I spent the last two years seeking to develop policy and represent Australian business overseas in improving our export performance.

        In January of this year, I had the honour of presenting a report which showed that, under existing policies, the improved export performance that Australia had achieved, particularly in manufactures and services, had created a situation where we could sustain a rate of growth one per cent higher than previously possible without triggering the current account constraint—and this traditionally had been one of the two constraints on Australia's capacity to sustain growth. The other was inflation, which is substantially under control

In public it has been focused most upon the so-called DIFF scheme where I had the opportunity to negotiate, on behalf of the Australian government and Australian companies, access and opportunities for Australian companies to win projects internationally and create jobs in Australia—to see those projects dashed.

        What we have is the government in the face of unemployment, as a gesture of despair, essentially taking its hands off the wheel and saying, `We cannot solve this problem, it will continue at the existing level even on our best estimate.' A statement of despair, too, on the current account deficit—the budget papers say it will still be four per cent of GDP at the end of this financial year. I suspect, unless the economy slows more than we think, the adverse effect on exports is such that it might be worse than that. However, if the economy, as I fear, grows more slowly, that will have an impact on imports and it will probably mean that four per cent of GDP will not turn out to be a bad estimate. Four per cent of GDP at this time in the economic cycle is not

That is 200 years out of date and is not a policy strategy that is acceptable to any contemporary government trying to compete successfully internationally.

I am talking about arts funding, the funding of the ABC, the production fund for new programs for television, and the support for the great Australian film industry.

Who is working has changed, where they are working has changed, what sort of work they are doing has changed, what qualifications and training they bring to their workplace have changed, for whom they are working has changed and the hours those in employment are performing have changed.

         It raises a very profound question about the distribution of work in our society.

Those in work are working longer, while many people are not in work and a significant number of people in part-time work would seek more. Not all people in part-time work prefer full-time employment—that is a bit of a myth—but a lot of people do. Fair distribution of work will be one of the great issues all members of this House will have to face up to into the next century. It is one of the equity issues which we all have to address. I do not pretend that I have all the answers to it; I just know it is a very important issue.

         —It certainly is an honour to speak this evening on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which is a budget bill for the first conservative coalition budget for 13 or 14 years and certainly a historical document. It was interesting to listen to the previous speaker, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), talk about the collective good of Australia as a nation. When you talk to people in the community about the direction the former government were taking the collective nation of Australia as far as the national debt was concerned, you find that is what really did concern a lot of people and ultimately cost the Labor government the last election. They had had 13 years to deal with the chronic unemployment problem, they had had 13 years to deal with debt, they had had 13 years to deal with the deficit and bad balance of payments figures and they failed.

We had to have the recession! Many small businesses were sent packing, many farmers were sent off their farms and families were sent out of their homes because of the high interest rate regime that was run by the former administration. They are the sorts of things we want to turn around by reducing debt, eliminating the budget deficit, increasing national savings and putting this nation on a lot stronger economic footing where we will experience and enjoy a much more stable interest rate regime for the benefit of small business, for the benefit of farmers, for the benefit of families and, most importantly, for the benefit of the children of the future.

Prior to the election the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the then opposition leader, challenged the then Prime Minister, the then Treasurer and the then Minister for Finance. He said, `Give us the true and accurate state of Australia's economy.' Treasury and Finance could have easily done it.

It has happened in other countries around the world, it has been spoken about in states in Australia and it is going to happen in the Commonwealth. Prior to forthcoming elections, there will be a statement of account as to where the Commonwealth's economy is up to.

That is something that we promised to deliver to the people of Australia in our election campaign in March—not only so all the so-called experts in this place and all the economists out there in the private sector can understand it but also so all the people in mainstream Australia, the

That is why they voted a coalition government into power on 2 March. They knew that we would have the backbone to address the economic failings that had been perpetrated by Labor for 13 years on this country, that we would address those structural problems that the previous administration was not prepared to or going to address. In a lot of cases, the previous administration knew where the problems were, they knew what they had to do, but either they did not have the backbone to do it or they were not allowed to do it by their industrial wing.

Obviously, with the senator's support in mind, the minister, who really does know better, agreed to his requests and the results are for all to see.

          The decision is an embarrassment to Australia. It reverses Australia's previously solid commitments to population aid just to gain the support of one senator. The World Health Organisation, renowned for its programs, faces the withdrawal of $725,000. I have previously been critical of Senator Harradine's forays into this area. I am sick of fundamentalist perverse morality being imposed upon essential programs in the population area.

I note in today's press that the foreign minister will be lobbying for Australia to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. I wish him well, but how does he expect that the cuts that have been imposed on very important programs which support poverty reduction will be received?

        There are 20 diseases present in the salmon population of North America that are not present in either our salmon or trout stocks. The real dangers that this presents to regions in my electorate have, I believe, been ignored in the import risk analysis reported to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in May of this year. Referring to just one of the 20 diseases known to be present in North American salmon—namely, bacterial kidney disease, BKD—the import risk analysis stated on page 32:

        While much attention has been focused on the BKD disease there is another disease that is causing even more concern, and I refer to whirling disease. This disease attacks the soft skeleton of young fish before their bones harden, usually resulting in a deformed spine which causes the diseased fish to constantly swim in a whirling fashion—hence the name of the disease. It also affects the nervous system of the fish.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When the diseased fish die, the organism which causes the disease, myxosoma cerebralus, sends out spores through the water to take up residence in tubifex worms that live in the mud. When the organism matures, it leaves the worm in search of a new host—a young fish. This organism is capable of existing in river sediment for long periods of time.

         —I rise this evening to encourage those opposite to read the fine print of the budget that they are so adulatory of. In the fine print of the budget, you will find that the Liberal Party in this place gives with one hand and whacks families with the other. Let us look at some of the fine print. Education costs are up; HECS is increased; Austudy is cut; university, schools and TAFE funding is cut; and assistance for students with disabilities is slashed altogether. Such was the reception of that portion of the budget in Western Australia that the

        Education is not enough for this mob; there are also extra health cost cuts and health funding cuts. There is an $800 million cut to hospital funding. That will mean longer hospital waiting lists in the states. The AMA said of the federal budget:

        If it is not enough to whack the elderly with health costs, you whack them up-front with aged care costs. Older family members who need nursing homes will have to pay up-front entry fees of around $26,000. Then you will get them day by day with new daily fees of up to $34 a day. And if it is not enough to do that, you will make them pay hourly rates—user pays—for things like meals on wheels. On our calculations it will be up to $4 an hour. This is a sensationally compassionate lot opposite. If it is not enough to get families on health, to get them on aged care costs, you whack them with prescription costs. We find that listed prescription drugs will go up from $17.40 to $20. Pensioners who are currently paying $2.70 will find that the price will go up to $3.20. The Pharmacy Guild's report on the budget states that `pensioners may face financial difficulty.' Of course they will.

        If it is not enough to whack the people going to schools, TAFE or universities, if it is not enough to whack families whose children are sick and need prescriptions, if it is not enough to whack elderly people who may need to go to hospital or nursing homes, then you get young children, with child-care costs. With the reduction of community based child-care operating fees, families can expect to pay anywhere from $14 to $30 extra per week per child. Child-care funding is cut by about $500 million, shifting the cost burden to families.

        In my own state of Western Australia, this budget will cut over $100 million from Western Australia. How will the state government find that money? In one of three ways: they will cut services, they will cut jobs, or they will impose extra taxes and charges. What has Richard Court had to say about this issue? The silence has been deafening. At least his old man had a bit of ticker. He would always stand up for Western Australia rather than simply mantra chant `Western Australia'. It is about time we saw the Premier of Western Australia stand up for Western Australia and stand up for families who come from Western Australia.

        Following the budget announcement of incentives to help Australia's small businesses, I sent a survey out to all the small and medium sized businesses in my electorate of Canning. The response to date has been phenomenal. In the survey I asked small businesses:

        Mr Acting Speaker, the response from these small business owners was always the same. They have said to me, `Fix Labor's unfair dismissal laws.' `Reduce the level of taxation on small business.' `Reduce the amount of paperwork we have to complete.' `Reform the industrial relations system.' And, `Let's have a look at the level of commercial interest rates.' The response I have had from these small business owners shows that the coalition government is on the right track. Our budget and other policy announcements address all of these issues.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has already met its commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to six per cent. This means that small business is no longer assessed for the provisional tax on income in excess of what it has earned. This is a major benefit to small business and how it operates. This alone will deliver $180 million back to provisional taxpayers in 1996&amp;hyphen;97.

        This government's industrial relations reforms currently before the parliament will rectify Labor's job&amp;hyphen;destroying unfair dismissal laws. The sooner the people in the upper house recognise the necessity to pass this legislation the sooner small businesses can get on with the business of employing people and creating real jobs. This coalition government has done more for Australia's small businesses in the mere six months it has been in office than the Australian Labor Party did in its 13 years in government. Being a small business operator myself, I know precisely what I am talking about.

We know that it is small business that employs the majority of Australians. We know that it is small business that takes on the majority of young people either under an apprenticeship scheme or some other form of training program. This government is committed to encouraging the small business sector and to ensuring that it gets on and creates a livelihood for all Australians.

        At its thirty seventh session, by its Resolution 37/30 of 23 November 1982, the United Nations General Assembly requested the United Nations Secretary&amp;hyphen;General (UNSG) to initiate consultations with all parties directly concerned with the question of East Timor with a view to exploring avenues for achieving a comprehensive settlement of the problem and to report to the Assembly at its thirty&amp;hyphen;eighth session. Although the question of East Timor is included annually in the General Assembly's provisional agenda, the matter is now customarily rolled over. The last resolution to be passed on East Timor in the General Assembly was Resolution 37/30.

       (1) It is the case that taxation concessions do have the potential to sometimes be "rorted" or provide unintended tax benefits to claimants. Because of this, the administration of tax concessions should be subjected to regular evaluation and review. In accord with the Government's election commitment, a review of the R&amp;D tax concession has now been completed and changes have been announced by the Government.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The primary outcome of that review is the Government's action to close off future access to the R&amp;D tax concession by syndicates.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) Prior to this decision, no administrative barriers were erected which deferred or delayed consideration and approval of applications. The IR&amp;D Board, through its Tax Concession Committee, has been diligent in its duty to carefully consider the value of the proposed R&amp;D and the proposed financial arrangements of syndicates. It is this proper adherence to duty and accountability by the IR&amp;D Board and its Tax Concession Committee that has delayed consideration of some syndicate proposals, rather than any form of artificial barrier.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) Unintended tax benefits were obtained by investors in syndicates through a series of legally complex transactions and highly inflated core technology valuations. The use of overseas tax havens, pre capital gains technology and tax exempt organisations became common place. The cost to the Commonwealth revenue of these syndicates was calculated by the BIE to be in the range of $0.83 and $1.42 per dollar of new R&amp;D. While the range was dependant upon the commercial focus of the R&amp;D conducted and the value of
       <break page="3915" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       No. A three&amp;hyphen;day conference (including workshop) on the Corporations Law Simplification Program was arranged in Sydney and Melbourne for July 1996, and Brisbane for August 1996, by IIR Pty Ltd. Members of the Simplification Task Force were, or will be amongst the speakers at the conference, and the Treasury has been associated with the organisation of the conference.

       The Task Force's participation in this conference in no way affects the Task Force's own program for conducting public seminars around Australia in connection with exposure drafts of its legislation. I would expect, as has been the case previously, that these seminars will continue to be held in Perth. I understand that the Task Force's next series of seminars will be conducted following the release of the Third Corporate Law Simplification Bill, expected later this year.

       (a) The Australia and New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA), which came into force in 1983, is the primary instrument governing the conduct of trade between Australia and New Zealand in goods and services. The purpose of ANZCERTA is to develop closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand through the mutually beneficial expansion of free trade under conditions of fair competition, via a gradual and progressive elimination of barriers to trade, including through the harmonisation of business laws.

       When New Zealand enacted the Commerce Act 1986 (the CA) in 1986 the competition provisions of that statute were largely based on the competition provisions in the Australian Trade Practices Act 1974 (the TPA). Subsequently, each country has undertaken periodic reviews leading to minor modifications in their competition laws. Notwithstanding the various modifications to the statutes, substantial harmonisation remains and is intended to continue. Some changes in the statutes have been complementary; for example, on 1 July 1990, under the auspices of ANZCERTA, the availability of anti-dumping actions on goods originated in each other's markets was removed and the misuse of market power provisions were expanded to take in trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman markets.

       Although New Zealand and Australian competition laws are similar, Australia's recent implementation of reforms in response to the Hilmer Report (released in August 1993) has greatly enhanced Australia's national competition policy; for example, Australian law now includes provision for third party access to significant infrastructure facilities, such as electricity grids. Furthermore, our national competition policy contains processes for future reform, including the review of anti-competitive legislation to ensure that such legislation produces net public benefits and the implementation of competitive neutrality principles for government businesses. There is no formal mechanism to harmonise these areas of competition policy between Australia and New Zealand. However, the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement which provides for mutual recognition of various Australian and New Zealand regulations and standards relating to the sale of goods and the registration of occupations is consistent with the competition policy objective of removing regulatory restrictions on competition.

Therefore, it is uncertain precisely what the effects might be, though cooked chicken meat imports are anticipated to comprise some 2&amp;hyphen;5% of domestic chicken meat consumption. To try and resolve this and to ensure that industry has an input into assessing the impact of cooked chicken meat imports, I have set up a Working Group, comprised of representatives from the industry and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which will be reporting to me shortly.

       (1) I am aware of the article in the

       of 8 June 1996 entitled `Crime in America'. The article refers to an international crime survey carried out in 1992 by the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands which it is claimed indicates that a person is more likely to be burgled in Australia than in America, although later in the article the comparison is made between Sydney and Los Angeles.
      </para>

       While the comparisons referred to in the article are open to question, I share the concern of my state and territory colleagues who are responsible for community policing that the level of burglaries in Australia is too high.

       (2) I am not aware of statistics which show decisively the percentage of burglaries committed by persons seeking to support their drug habits. There is statistical data indicating that most dependent heroin users fund their drug use from property crime. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that a significant proportion of such crimes may be attributable to users of heroin in particular.

       (3) The government has set net savings targets for all government departments and agencies. The National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police are among those government agencies required to meet such targets. Both agencies will ensure available resources are allocated to minimise the impact of cuts on their core investigative functions.

       The issue of voter identification at polling booths was examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its enquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election. In its November 1994 Report to the Parliament entitled `The 1993 Federal Election' the Committee concluded that all objective evidence indicated that fraud was not a significant occurrence and did not influence any result at the 1993 federal election. The Committee did not support a requirement for proof of identity at polling booths.

This is achieved by eliminating the need to assess each tender for commitment to quality, financial viability and industry development, as all panellists have been pre&amp;hyphen;qualified for those aspects. Government also reduces its legal and contract administration costs by obviating the need for individual agencies to negotiate their own set of terms and conditions, as DAS has already done so on their behalf.

       (b) Small business benefits from using the IT Services Panel by reducing the amount of paperwork to do business with Government. The benefits of pre&amp;hyphen;qualification that the agencies derive are, in turn, enjoyed by small business, as they are not required to re&amp;hyphen;establish their credentials for every tender.

       Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) also benefit because the IT Services Panel removes barriers for these companies to participate in significant government contracts.
