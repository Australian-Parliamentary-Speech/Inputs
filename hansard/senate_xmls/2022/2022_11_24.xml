                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:02</span>):  I rise today to make a short contribution on the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022. Matters of conscience are always those in this chamber where we do hear very heartfelt contributions. Certainly, as I have considered whether or not to speak on this bill, I have read the contributions from colleagues right around the chambers. There is obviously a depth of feeling about this issue that reveals why it is a matter of conscience, and I think it's important that we do put our positions on the record in matters of conscience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, this very much comes down to a question of the structure of our Constitution, the roles and responsibilities of various levels of government and the way in which this parliament should deal with such matters, particularly in relation to the territories. It is important when considering matters—particularly matters of life and death—that we do consider the structure of the Constitution and the responsibilities that that gives to states on the one hand and territories on the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Territories do fall into a different category in our constitutional arrangements. That is for a very particular reason, and it is something that we in this place cannot, and should not, ignore. When we are considering legislation that involves life or death, states obviously have the capacity to make those decisions under our Constitution, and no-one in this place has tried to alter the arrangements, say, in my home state of Western Australia or in other states around Australia, on issues such as euthanasia. However, with the territories, we are in a different category. Territories are smaller jurisdictions; they send a different number of members to this place, for example. The arrangements are different and are reflected differently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory considered the matter of statehood at a point in the past and rejected it. There may come a point in the future when statehood is desired by the Northern Territory or perhaps even the Australian Capital Territory, in which case the pathway would be open to a different set of powers and responsibilities. But in that case—and with all due respect to my friends in Queensland—if statehood were embraced, we would want to see a much more robust, democratic framework. I personally am a believer in two houses of parliament: a lower house and an upper house, like the Senate or the upper houses in most of the other states, which provide the checks and balances. In territory jurisdictions, we do not see the same level of democracy operating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not to take anything away from the self-governing rights of the Northern Territory or the ACT. However, what we have here is a piece of legislation already on the books at the Commonwealth level. The history of the bill has been addressed a number of times, and I'm not going to traverse that area again, but we now, in all good conscience, have to make a decision on whether we will change those arrangements that are in place. In all conscience, and looking at the situation around the world and in Australia where these laws—whether you want to call them euthanasia laws or voluntary assisted dying laws—have been put in place, we cannot guarantee that mistakes are not made. As a parliament and as a chamber, we have to consider that fact in moving to change the current arrangements. That is why I will not be supporting this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:06</span>):  The Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022 presents a difficult and a complex mix of issues, principles and considerations. I've weighed and deeply considered these issues and the competing principles and concerns over the last few months. I do have sympathy for the argument that the citizens of our territories should have the same rights as the citizens of our states in regard to their parliaments being able to make laws in relation to the same issues that state parliaments are able to. I do have sympathy with that. However, there is no escaping the fact that, under our Constitution, the territories are not, in fact, directly equivalent to the states. Self-government is granted to the territories by acts of the federal parliament. That being the case, we in this parliament bear a level of responsibility for the governance of those territories. This is a responsibility that, for the vast majority of matters, we effectively delegate to the elected parliaments of the territories, but it is our responsibility nonetheless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The responsibility we are asked to discharge in our consideration of this bill—the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022—is a heavy one. The inevitable impact of this bill before us, should it pass the parliament, is that another parliament will enact laws authorising the practice of euthanasia. I recognise that there are many divergent views on the practice of euthanasia and many legitimate concerns regarding its practice. One of those concerns, which is always at the forefront of my mind in the consideration of this issue, is the possibility of the misuse of such a scheme, whether it be by negligence, incompetence, ignorance or, even worse, deliberate ill intent. We here in this place are in a unique and invidious position. We are being asked to pass a law when we know that the effect will be the ending of human lives. Yet, unlike representatives of state parliaments when making the same decision, we here have no ability whatsoever to put in place, or have any oversight of, safeguards to protect citizens from the potential misuse of those laws. We would be, in effect, making a decision that will result in the ending of human lives but washing our hands of any responsibility for the consequences, and I do not find myself able to support any such action in good conscience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, without a doubt, one of the more complex and troubling decisions that I have had to make in my time in the Senate to date, and I do not take it lightly. I've considered the principles behind this bill and weighed the consequences closely. After having done so, I'm not able to vote in the affirmative, so I will be voting against this bill. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:10</span>):  I rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022. Like Senator Chandler and Senator Brockman, I respect and appreciate the heavy burden that is on each of us in making this decision of conscience. This bill does present complex issues because, in being asked to support this bill, we are being asked to differentiate between the way that the states and the territories—the Northern Territory and the ACT—are constituted. This, for me, is a bill that I cannot support. I cannot support this bill because it's deeply offensive to me that one of the principal objectives of this bill is to give the territories the right to pass laws which would end human life. I understand and appreciate that everyone has very deeply felt convictions in relation to this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, this is very personal. I lost my mum and my dad, both of whom spent a considerable period of time in palliative care at a young age. I have seen firsthand what families go through as they deal with loved ones reaching their end of life. For me, this bill, because of its inevitable consequence, is a statement that we in Australia are prepared to kill our most vulnerable, sometimes under circumstances when it becomes too difficult or perhaps too expensive or too inconvenient to allow them to live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Senator Chandler made a very sound point in this debate. We are being asked to pass a law—to change the current arrangements—to, essentially, give the territories the right to pass euthanasia laws, under circumstances where all of us in this place can't even be certain as to the safeguards that would be put in place if such laws were passed. I have consistently argued against euthanasia. For me, this is just inherently wrong. It represents state sanctioned killing, and it is a very poor reflection on a society which cannot look after their most vulnerable, particularly those who have a terminal illness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of years ago I advocated very strongly for a change in the law which currently allows vile, evil organisations like Exit International to send suicide kits through the mail. I find it abhorrent that Australia Post and other parcel delivery companies may be unwittingly facilitating the end of someone's life by reason of allowing these kits to be mailed throughout Australia and facilitating mail going in and out of this country. I've been a consistent worrier about the notion that any state should permit the deliberate ending of a life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a particular concern raised about Indigenous Australians. There are deep concerns in Indigenous communities, particularly, of course, in the Northern Territory, that should these laws be passed these laws would be used to facilitate the end of the lives of Indigenous Australians. I think this applies across the board to all vulnerable Australians, and, while there may be some who are adamant that they want to end their own life, I also believe that the prospects of misuse of any law, including the laws that have been passed by the states, remain high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Victoria passed its voluntary assisted dying laws I described that day as a very black day for Victoria. I hope that we are able to change the law in Victoria. I hope that we as a society are able to drive more investment in palliative care, to respect the dignity of life and to reflect on the fact that even the most vulnerable deserve the dignity of life until the very end of their life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons I fought so hard for Anam Cara hospice, which was proudly supported by our government to the tune of more than $7 million, is that I wanted to make sure that in the Geelong region there would be a place of dignity where people who had a terminal illness would get the greatest possible care in their darkest days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm only going to make a few brief remarks on this bill. Again, I reiterate my deep understanding of the complexity of this bill. I respect the fact that there are many who believe that the Northern Territory and the ACT should have complete autonomy when it comes to passing their own laws. But, at the end of the day, the Commonwealth, by reason of our constitutional arrangements, bears a great deal of responsibility. For that reason, knowing that one of the principal objectives of this bill is to facilitate laws which would lead to voluntary assisted dying or euthanasia being permitted in both the ACT and the Northern Territory, I cannot in all good conscience, from the bottom of my heart, support this bill.</span>

If we proceed to conclude the debate on this bill today, there will be no opportunity for those amendments to be considered—and I'm hopeful we are able to. I'm not seeking to delay the completion of this bill beyond the end of this sitting period.

I don't have my head fully around the technical nature of a couple of the things that would be contemplated in these amendments. I'm not seeking to detain this. I'm not seeking to prevent this from progressing to its conclusion and enabling laws to be passed by this parliament. That is not my intention at all.</span>

Would we be able, at some point in this sitting fortnight, to contemplate those amendments when they are completed?</span>

This is something that I've been fighting for for over a decade, including when I was Chief Minister of the ACT. The Senate just expressed its will with a vote of 41 to 25 in favour of the territories having rights restored that were taken away from them in 1997. I want to mark this moment and I want to thank everybody for the way that we've conducted this but also for their support for the rights of the territories.</span>

The Senate does move quickly at times, and we have to be nimble and ready for it. The preference would be to get it done, to get the final vote today. I think the second reading vote indicates the overwhelming support of the Senate to deal with this bill and to reach its conclusion after a long period of time. But the committee process is there for senators to utilise.</span>

In the context of my second reading contribution to this debate I made reference to the fact that the special rapporteur with respect to the convention, the UN special rapporteur, has raised concern with respect to the Canadian legislation and, in particular, the fact that medically assisted dying can be used in situations in a Canadian context. I'll quote the provision so you will understand the concern I am raising. First, where a person has 'a grievous and irremediable medical condition', and that is defined as including a person having a 'serious and incurable illness, disease or disability'. The concern which the United Nations special rapporteur has raised is that there are material concerns with respect to the Canadian regime actually complying with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I seek advice from the minister with respect to what steps the Australian government has in place to make sure that, when the territory does adopt legislation, Australia does comply with its treaty obligations with respect to the rights of people with disabilities. </span>

It's a question not related to this bill. This bill is about restoring the rights of territories to be able to debate bills that will deal with the issues that you have raised as they have been dealt with by the states, who have passed legislation to this effect. But I think, in terms of questions about this bill, it's a straightforward repeal bill of the constraint that was placed on the territories that didn't allow them to debate or pass bills. In terms of the controls on the territories, their governments are democratically elected, and the people will judge the territories on how they manage laws, should they proceed with laws that this bill facilitates. </span>

The fact of the matter is there are those who have concerns with respect to the fact that this bill doesn't contain any safeguards whatsoever. It simply, as you put it, restores the rights of the territories to implement legislation. There are those of us who have a concern that that does represent a blank cheque, albeit it's got to go through the Northern Territory legislative process. Again, I seek your view with respect to: what processes does the government have in place generally to ensure that legislation in this space actually complies with Australia's obligations regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? I would expect that the government has some sort of mechanism in place in terms of ensuring that legislation, be it by states or territories, in fact complies with our international obligations, and that is something which is fairly and squarely within the domain of this parliament under the foreign affairs power. </span>

It was passed when I was a member of that parliament. As I said, that's not a matter related to this bill. The Commonwealth works with states and territories around a whole range of matters, but this bill is a simple repeal bill. Should the territory go down any path that they choose—and I imagine they will; they have foreshadowed they will—then that is a matter for the territory parliament and the people that elect them.</span>

They're not drafted at the moment. One Nation has no objection to that whatsoever in light of this bill and the implications it's going to have on the Northern Territory and the people who, for the sheer fact they live in the Territory, don't have the same rights as people who live in the states. They are being dictated to by the federal government. I understand that. It's not their fault; they happen to live in a territory. It's the same for the ACT. I know that it was a conscience vote. I voted for the bill, and my colleague Senator Roberts voted against it. It is a personal decision we made after listening to constituents and people, not just in our own state but across the country, say how important this bill is.</span>

I know it was a resounding 41 to 25, but surely, on such an important matter, is it really going to put an impost on this parliament and the people here representing all Australians? We need to make sure that we get it right. Is it really going to cause a lot of problems for this parliament if we keep it open in committee so that we can see what the amendments are and then make a final decision on that, based on what we think is right? I agree. I have no problem with keeping it in committee. Let's see what amendments are drafted. Let's make sure we get it right on an important matter like this.</span>

This is a crucial bill that has been 20-odd years in the making. We were very pleased to see the vote just now allowing territories to make decisions about their own issues. That is a crucial point of democracy.</span>

It's not like we didn't know this bill was listed and it was coming on. We feel that it's highly procedurally unusual to now be asked for the stage to be talked out whilst amendments get drafted. If you're not well enough organised to deal with something that was scheduled on the program, I don't think you should really be getting any favours. We are ready to vote and pass this bill. It has been 20 years in the making. We will now sit down and not make further contributions, with the idea of getting it done.</span>

This is not in any way to detract from the result of the vote that just occurred. It was, as Senator Hanson said, a comprehensive decision made by this Senate on behalf of the communities that senators represent. I'm not seeking to take away from that. I voted one way and others voted another, and I respect that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sorry, but please don't characterise this—I heard someone say the homework's not done. We're not seeking to just talk it out. The reality is I have just asked whether there was a willingness on the part of the proponent of the bill to allow us time to consider this. I know it's inconvenient and I'm sorry that I am now asking for that, but I have got to get this done on behalf of others that have sought this—volunteer and community groups that have reached out in relation to these issues—and I don't think that's an unreasonable thing. I want to make sure that the Leader of the Greens understands that this is not some exercise to detract from a decision that is going to be made by this parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the numbers mean that this will be legislated and that the territories' rights will be restored. I understand it's frustrating, but there are important considerations. I accept what Senator Gallagher has said; this bill is a straightforward repeal of legislation that's already in existence. But there are flow-on implications for that in relation to so many other areas. In her contribution she referenced the territory's own human rights protections, which I gather are enshrined in legislation. There will be other flow-on implications for those sorts of protections in the community in each of the territories once a repeal is made, so just having the capacity to consider amendments around that would, I think, be helpful.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not seeking to frustrate debate; I'm not seeking to take up time to change people's minds. Minds have been made up, and it has been 20 years in the making. As Senator Waters said, these are important issues, and I just want to make sure that we do have the time to be able to get these amendments completed and put before the committee.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  I too rise to raise a question in relation to providing this chamber with the opportunity to bring forward these amendments. We were all expecting this bill to come on for a vote next Friday. We all obviously scrambled, with very little notice, into the chamber this morning when this came on unexpectedly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Senator Duniam, I absolutely respect the will of this Senate. I am not seeking to alter or amend or delay in any way what is the obvious will of the Senate, but I do pay particular tribute to Senator Hanson, who, whilst voting yes and supporting the repeal of the enacting legislation, recognises that there are proper and legitimate bases for bringing forward amendments. Just imagine what would transpire if this bill were passed today and sound and proper amendments that perhaps hadn't been properly considered were not brought before the chamber. I think that would be an absolute travesty. So, again, this is a really genuine plea to Senator Gallagher and to the government: there may well be things whereby all senators—or some senators—irrespective of how they vote today, might actually see some good cause to support or at least consider these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know as well that the Senate Procedure Office is absolutely flat out at the moment. I sent something to the Senate Procedure Office yesterday. They are literally working around the clock. I think I received something back from the office last night. Also, to support the Senate Procedure Office, which is really under the pump, I think this would be the right thing to do; I think it would be the respectful thing to do. Assuming that the will of the Senate is to support this bill, which evidently is the case now—frankly, I don't see that changing—it would validate the decision of the Senate if all senators were to be given a proper opportunity to consider any amendments.</span>

We are in the hands of the chamber. I can see what's going on here: you've got to get to 10 past 10. We are not in a position to stop the committee stage, nor would we try to stop the committee stage. I think what would be interesting, and perhaps the best use of the next 20 minutes—if this is going to kick over—is if the amendments that are being drafted were foreshadowed in regard to what they are. Perhaps someone could stand up and elaborate on what the amendments to this bill are, because it is a straightforward repeal bill, so I'm struggling to understand what amendments actually would relate to this bill. It's a yes or no: should the bill be repealed? It would be unusual, unless you were going to stray into trying to legislate some other kinds of protections or you were creating another bill, because this bill just gets rid of a bill; that's the point of it. I'm happy to hear what the amendments might be, but I also acknowledge and I would like to put on the record the fact that we have two ACT senators voting for the first time in favour of territory rights. I think that's a very significant moment for the territory, and I acknowledge the work and commitment of Senator David Pocock in that regard.</span>

There's no strategy. There's nothing other than a genuine proposal to ask the question, with the greatest of sincerity. I don't have any amendments to bring forward but, if any senator has amendments to bring forward, then it's right and proper that they be considered. So I want to really strongly put on the record that there's nothing going on here. There's no plan. In fact, I will say that Senator David Pocock and I had a discussion earlier on, and he asked me whether I was happy for the vote to occur today and I said yes—and Senator David Pocock can vouch for me on that—but now that I know that there are senators in this place who want to bring forward amendments, in absolute sincerity, Senator Gallagher, I just want to put on the record that I think the right and proper thing to do is to allow those amendments to be brought forward.</span>

I understand that not everyone is comfortable with this, but this is about territory rights. This is about recognising that the territories are mature enough to debate and legislate on issues as sensitive as voluntary assisted dying. I urge the committee to deal with this matter. There's a huge amount of other legislation before us. This is incredibly important, but, in the scheme of things, it's quite a simple yes or no.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                    </a>  I take the interjection from Senator Green. I understand very clearly what Senator Gallagher has said: the bill is a straight-out repeal of existing legislation. But, as I said before—and I don't think it's an unreasonable point to make—there are consequences to any bill that is passed. This enables, as Senator David Pocock has said, the territories to legislate in respect of this issue. Even though it's not the subject of the bill, it is the issue in contemplation in the territories. I'm not seeking to prevent that from becoming law, despite having voted a certain way based on the principles I outlined in my speech. But to Senator Green's interjection, yes, I know what the bill is about, but there are consequences to everything we pass. In this one the first amendment relates to the schemes in all states and territories as it would be post the passage of this legislation and the scope in particular of access to voluntary assisted dying to people under the age of 18, so there is an amendment proposed around what scope there would be for provision of VAD in all states and territories relating to VAD being administered to children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a proposed amendment relating to the TGA review of the medications utilised in the administration of VAD and the approval process and exemptions that are granted under the regulations that exist in relation to this particular medication. That is a relatively straightforward amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a third amendment relating to the import of the medications that are utilised in the administration of VAD in all states and territories. So they're just in relation to what will inevitably be consequences to the passage of this legislation. They aren't about overturning the effect of the bill. They are in relation to the scope and some of the other technical issues that have been raised. These are issues that have been raised. They are not about trying to deviate from what has been or will be achieved by this parliament. I think, as I have just outlined to the committee, they're not spurious nothings; they are significant issues that I wanted to foreshadow now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it was a very fair request by Senator Gallagher, who sought this extra information around what they might be, and I have put that on record. I hope that gives some clarity about what is being proposed. They're not extraneous. They're not unrelated. They do relate to the consequences of the legislation and how its passage might, in effect, be administered on the ground in all states and territories that will have the capacity to legislate on this issue in the future.</span>

However—and I say this with all genuineness—I was fully expecting to speak on this bill next Thursday. I was fully expecting to speak on this bill. When I got up to speak on this bill this morning, I had no notes prepared. I had done very little thinking about it, to be perfectly honest. I had thought about the general issue obviously, but not in terms of this particular bill. The government put time aside in the program next Thursday—in fact, an open-ended debate next Thursday. It is important those listening to this debate understand this: that next Thursday is an open-ended sitting to deal with this bill. Clearly the government, in putting its program together, and all of those in the chamber were expecting this bill to be dealt with next Thursday and not this morning. The accusation has been made that people weren't adequately prepared, but the fact is that, up until last night, I was expecting this bill to be considered and debated—and any amendments to be proposed—next Thursday. I think that was the genuine case for many in this place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  I certainly do support what Senator Duniam is seeking to do, to allow some time for the procedure office to come back to us with the requested amendments so that we can properly consider them in a fulsome way. In Western Australia euthanasia laws were passed. The voluntary assisted dying laws went through the parliament. That parliament went through quite a marathon exercise to be able to get to the position that they did and pass the laws they have. I voted at the second reading against this, but one of the things that were put in place as a result of the debate in the consideration in detail of the legislation that went through in Western Australia were necessary protections to ensure that you don't have the very worst examples that we see around the world where euthanasia is used—for example, I think the Netherlands allow for people to have euthanasia for psychological conditions, not just physiological health issues. I don't think anyone in Australia would be contemplating that, but we can't know. We're making a decision here about legislation with an outcome that we don't fully know what the make-up of it would be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the process that the Western Australian parliament went through, they very clearly laid out what the limitations of their bill would be and the protections that would be in place. Some of the amendments that Senator Duniam has foreshadowed would go some of the way—and I appreciate that this is just a repeal bill—towards ensuring that some protections could be in place to make sure that we can't find ourselves in a situation where we are going down the path of other jurisdictions. In fact, some jurisdictions around the world allow for children to engage with euthanasia. I don't think that's something that Australians want to see contemplated, but we can't know. We're the ones who will ultimately make the decision here about a law with an ultimate outcome that will be in the territories when we can't be sure what they will be legislating and what protections they will put in place. So some of the amendments that Senator Duniam foreshadowed go towards ensuring that there are at least some protections. I certainly ask that the chamber allow time to consider those. I don't think it would take very long to go through those very simple proposals and maybe put in place some protections in this bill to ensure that we can't have those unintended consequences.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I'm a senator for the Northern Territory. It is very important to understand that we have the Northern Territory as well as the ACT. The Northern Territory is a very unique place in comparison to places like the ACT. While I can respect the way in which this parliament is likely to vote on this particular issue, there has been very little in the way of safeguards with regard to some of our most vulnerable members of this country who reside in the Northern Territory, where I'm from.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just a matter of repealing a bill to allow for territories to make decisions. Being a representative of the Northern Territory, I also recognise some of the very dire decisions that the current Territory government have made with regard to the lives of some of the most vulnerable. I think my colleague the member for Lingiari, in the House of Representatives, has also expressed some of her deep concerns with regard to some of the decisions that the current Territory government have made.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Northern Territory, death is something that occurs on a regular basis. It has certainly featured heavily in my life, from when I was a child. So I see it as my responsibility as a senator for the Northern Territory to do everything that I can to save lives. I think it's very important not to disregard my colleagues' request in terms of taking into consideration these amendments going forward. It's not a flippant, last-minute decision to try to delay the decision on this particular bill, the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022. It is actually about considering what those safeguards might look like, particularly for vulnerable Australians, who are often unheard and often disregarded because they're often out of sight and out of mind, certainly for this place here in Canberra and for other parts of the nation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear platitudes of acknowledgement and respect for vulnerable Aboriginal Australians all the time. We hear it constantly. But, having spent only a short time in this chamber, I feel we never really, deeply consider those very vulnerable people in those communities. That is why I am here.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope you can understand this, Senator David Pocock: the circumstances are very different from your territory to my territory. I hope that my colleagues in this chamber can understand what I am trying to convey, not just with this particular issue but with other issues that are going to have consequences for some of our most vulnerable people in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot stop the outcome of the vote on this bill. What I can do is support this chamber considering the amendments that have been foreshadowed by my colleague in order that we might have some level of safeguard going forward. That's because I do recognise that, in the Northern Territory, we have a government that is not listening—that has allowed for the destruction of vulnerable people. I field calls every single day about alcohol-fuelled violence, because they respect the rights of drinkers and perpetrators who act out violently, as opposed to the rights of vulnerable victims in those communities, who are fleeing the communities—children are being taken out of school right now.</span>

I hope officials who've been beavering away overnight will actually respond. For the $18 million in the budget that this authority will have a financial impact with, what projects have been cut to offset the cost of the authority? I note $8 million of departmental funding. Can I have more detail about where in the department that has come from? That's quite a lot of money. For the $10 million out of the previous agency's funding, I would like to understand which area of the agency that came from. Was it project money, was it stationery or staples? Could the minister give me more clarity around the $18 million?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  The coalition takes Australia's international obligations to protect the marine environment from pollution from ships very seriously. The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 aligns Australia's domestic legislation with its international obligations that will support effective and consistent global regulations to protect the marine environment regarding pollution from ships. The International Maritime Organization progressively improves marine environment pollution standards for ships, and this bill aligns Australia with recent changes to international regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill aims to do three things. Firstly, this bill introduces controls for discharges of residues of noxious liquid substances, like certain grades of vegetable oil or paraffin-like substances that can form surface slicks. Ships will be required to meet new cargo tank cleaning, pre-wash and discharge procedures for persistent surface slicks. The new regulation applies to northern European waters and came into effect on 1 January 2021. Specifically, it applies to north-west European waters, the Baltic Sea, western European waters and the Norwegian Sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this bill bans the use of heavy fuel oils by shipping in Arctic waters from 1 July 2024. A similar ban is already in place in the Antarctic. The ban aims to reduce environmental impacts on sensitive Arctic environments caused by higher emissions of harmful air pollutants from ships burning heavy fuel oil. The heavy fuel oil ban also reduces the risk of oil spills. We've seen the devastating impact on marine ecosystems of oil spills in recent decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, from 1 January 2023 the bill extends controls on ships' harmful and antifouling systems to include the biocide chemical cybutryne. It's a long time since I've done year 11 chemistry, but to everyone watching upstairs—children—science! You'll be able to read speeches in the Senate appropriately too, one day! This chemical is chronically toxic for marine organisms. According to the APVMA, which is our own regulator of pesticides and chemicals, the use of cybutryne as an antifouling agent has never been registered or approved for use in ships in Australia. To be clear, this toxic chemical is unable to be used within our jurisdiction in Australia. This is our federal government responding to an international regulatory change which takes effect in the Northern Hemisphere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings Australian regulations into line with the international standards-setting body, the International Maritime Organization, which seeks to improve marine environment pollution standards via the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships—a very sensible and clear name—and the 2001 International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships. While Australian ships are subject to Australian legislation wherever they are in the world, this legislation is not expected to have any significant impacts on our Australian maritime industry. The Australian shipping industry has been consulted on the legislation and is supportive of the alignment with regulations of the international body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our own Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has also considered the amendments to MARPOL relating to the cargo residues and tank-washing of persistent floating products, the prohibition of the use and carriage of HFOs in Arctic water, and the HAFS convention relating to the control of cybutryne. Our treaty committee supported the amendments and agreed that binding action could be taken. We in the opposition—and we hold the deputy chairmanship of the treaties committee—are supportive of their advice to the Senate around this piece of legislation. The opposition will be supporting the government's bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CADELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  Australia is a shipping nation. We are surrounded by water, but we own few ships. This doesn't take into account what we're doing locally in our shipping, but what happens up north in the Arctic and the North Sea, around a lot of important things. Coming from the Hunter and previously being employed at the port, I know how much this is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The port of Newcastle brings in 4,800 shipping movements a year. Any one of those can go wrong, as we saw in 2007 with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pasha Bulker</span> parked up on Nobbys Beach. And what we could get in Australia is the leftover ships. Where we're working with bulk, we get things from moving up north—where we have the Triple Es of Maersk, where we have the Triple Es of 24,000 container ships, where we have the big ships. Australia doesn't have the content for that. So what we are doing here, in working out stuff up north, will eventually filter through to Australia. That's why it's important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's talk of this government reinstating a strategic fleet in Australia. I think I was at the press conference where that was launched, in the port of Newcastle, in the lead-up to the last election. What does this do? It protects the environment in case of a shipping accident and it puts a shipping structure in place to make sure we're not using bad chemicals on the bottom of our ships for antifouling. Why is that important? I'll give you an example in our harbour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The port of Newcastle has a mean depth of channel of 15.2 metres. That's big, indeed. But a ship at high tide, leaving that, will draw 15.1 metres. So we're talking massive ships, with a draw of 10 centimetres difference between the bottom of the ship and the bottom of the channel. If something were to scrape something that was there, we could grab that. We could put that in our channel. That could be bad. If we had another ship like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pasha Bulker</span>, we could see bunker oil that's probably the dirtiest, filthiest fuel oil around—I think still used by the Russian navy. Some say they tracked the <span style="font-style:italic;">Moskva</span> by its exhaust plumes. These things will all be outlawed under this process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of better systems to protect our marine environment, the use of better systems to protect our harbour environment up in the northern states, and us ratifying this treaty are so important to protect the biodiversity against what can come in on our ships. This is all below the waterline but what is above the waterline is just as important, and we are seeking it for all those treaties. We saw recently, also in the Hunter, varroa mite come in on a ship of some kind. The euthanising of many hives across the Hunter is still going on. They have most of the registered hives now. Anything we can do to clean up shipping to protect our environment and to protect our animals is a good thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 and everything going through doesn't apply to shipping in Australia, as it stands, but it will one day. That is why it is a good thing to support and why I am proud to be speaking in support of it. While we're talking about the environment and sea levels, workers shouldn't be subject to these chemicals for antifouling that can cause such bad things. We've seen what happens with PFAS on Australian land and around the world. This is a slight derivation of those chemicals, and we shouldn't have people, down slushy holes, working on that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a step in our international maritime obligations that will benefit Australia in the long term, if not now. It is something that will protect our environment. If we lose a bunker oil ship in the Arctic, it will do terrible things to that region. Bunker oil doesn't get cleaned. We've seen penguins and seabirds getting cleaned every day. It is the most horrible thing. I can't imagine an engine running on that stuff. So that is a very good thing to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow minister said, we'll be supporting the bill and I look forward to other regulations in this place that support our maritime industry. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I rise to make some remarks about the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2022. I don't profess to have the knowledge of Senator Cadell, who has spent a lot of time in the Hunter and Newcastle region, which is a great shipping part of New South Wales, but I certainly understand the importance of its commercial contribution to our state and the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our great attractions as a successful jurisdiction is that we are a country that maintains high standards. We are a serious country when it comes to the rule of law and we try to make our international obligations come to life through the enactment of domestic legislation and regulations. And that is what this particular measure is doing. It's basically putting into domestic law some of the commitments our country has made through international fora.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly in my home state of New South Wales, the shipping industry is a very significant employer, and so we do want to make sure that we are keeping pace with our international obligations across the board. Unless we do that, we are risking our capacity to attract foreign investment, in particular. I believe it is true in all the environmental matters of policy that moving as fast as we can is an important principle, because foreign investors will be looking for the cleanest and the greenest opportunities in which to invest. Whether that is in relation to our standards for domestic environmental purposes or whether that is the pace at which we enact various pieces of corporate law designed to give investors a complete picture of the environmental footprint, I think that is an important objective for this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the disclosure of emissions, scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, they are the subject of a significant consultation through international accounting bodies and the like. Obviously, I pay homage to members of my former profession, the accountants, who are some of the most exciting people that you'll ever have the opportunity to meet. They are working on these standards, and the standards should be taken very seriously by our policymakers, because I believe that the countries that move fastest on emissions disclosure are more likely to capture new investment as the global pool of capital looks for honesty in a particular company's emissions profile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't be doing these things in a reckless way, but we should be looking to do them at a pace which is ambitious. Regrettably, in the past we have not been an early mover on enacting our international environmental obligations. I accept that this is not directly relevant to this bill, but I think it is an important point to make in relation to keeping pace with international obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to seeing this bill being enacted. I believe that it will be supported by the opposition. We look forward to voting for the bill when we have the opportunity.</span>

The Australian government is committed to best practice maritime environmental protection, and the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 will bring Australia's maritime legislation in line with the latest globally agreed amendments to international maritime conventions that Australia is party to. The bill will further strengthen our marine environment protections by introducing the provisions to control the discharge of noxious liquid substances, known as persistent floaters, in certain European waters that came into force on 1 January 2021. It will extend the current ban on the use of heavy fuel oil by ships in the Antarctic to encompass Arctic waters from 1 July 2024 and ban the use of ship antifouling systems containing the toxic chemical biocide cybutryne from 1 January 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By legislating these environmental controls, Australia will uphold our longstanding international reputation for promoting safe and clean shipping operations, and we will be ensuring that international standards to reduce ship pollution and protect the marine environment are being implemented consistently across the globe. The Albanese government remains committed to ensuring Australia's maritime regulatory framework remains up to date and fit for purpose to support a healthy ocean, protect coastal communities and promote sustainable trade. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  On behalf of the coalition, I am pleased to rise to state the coalition's position relating to the Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Amendment Bill 2022. I'm pleased to say at the outset that the coalition will be supporting this bill. The Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Amendment Bill amends the Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Act 2016 to support the Commonwealth's effective recovery of the costs associated with regulating Australia's medical cannabis industry, including the costs of administration and monitoring and assessment of compliance, and to provide greater flexibility for regulations to prescribe the charges imposed on licence holders under the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Narcotic Drugs Act was amended in 2021 when the coalition was in government to simplify the medicinal cannabis licensing framework by implementing a single licence structure to replace the original three-licence structure that existed under the act. This bill revises the existing licence fees and charges to better align them with the new licence framework that was introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An independent review of the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 was commissioned by the coalition and undertaken by Professor John McMillan AO in the year 2019. It's known as the McMillan review. That review resulted in 26 recommendations to amend and improve the medicinal cannabis licensing and permits framework in Australia. The coalition in government agreed in principle to adopt all 26 recommendations of the McMillan review. This included recommendations to introduce a single licence model for medicinal cannabis regulation, replacing the previous three-licence model to simplify the related permits regime. Amendments under the coalition government to the narcotic drugs legislation regime commenced on 24 December, Christmas Eve, of the year 2021 to implement recommendations from the McMillan review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the introduction of the simplified licence structure, changes to the fees and charges framework are now necessary to align it with this new structure. As I have already stated, the coalition supports this bill. These changes were flagged by the McMillan review, which stated that the simplified licence structure meant the scale of fees and charges would need to be tailored to the range of activities encompassed by a particular application and licence. The activities relating to the administration of medicinal cannabis regulatory schemes are funded through cost-recovery arrangements which are consistent with the Australian government's charging framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to have a consistent policy when it comes to safeguards around medicines and the role of regulation. We do know that in the past there have been votes in this place where safeguards were proposed to be removed. They are worrying signs, and it is something we need to guard against. The PBS is vital to our country and deferrals of listings are something that we should seek to avoid. A healthy functioning economy paves the way, as we know, to list more medicines on the PBS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already seen the end of free rapid antigen tests for concession card holders and the delayed backflip on the cutting of pandemic leave disaster payments. The impact of the removal of services, such as telehealth consultations, and issues relating to cost-of-living pressures are some things that we need to be vigilant of. The opposition will remain vigilant on these issues and ensure that these services continue to be provided and made available for Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHOEBRIDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  I rise to speak on the Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Amendment Bill 2022 on behalf of the Greens, and I indicate from the outset that we don't oppose it. The bill makes relatively minor changes, largely creating a regulation-making power to allow for matters that will be the subject of multiple separate charges for licensing. The intent of the bill is to provide greater flexibility for licensing charges for medicinal cannabis, and, ultimately, the hope is to enable a simpler method for working out the amount of charges prescribed in the industry. This applies to medicinal cannabis and the licensing and permit schemes that exist under the Narcotic Drugs Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge the comprehensive evidence that medicinal cannabis can be absolutely life saving. In my state of New South Wales, I've spoken to family after family who have had their loved ones' lives turned around by the effect of medicinal cannabis. In some cases, they've broken down in tears and described to me how their child had been having convulsive seizures that no traditional medicine could treat, but then medicinal cannabis had actually ended those seizures and turned their child's life around. The hope and the extraordinary benefits that can be achieved in cases like that are genuinely inspiring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we reviewed this bill, we wanted to make sure that it did no harm to that industry and allowed for medicinal cannabis to continue to be available. We all know that the cost of medicinal cannabis in this country is far too high, and, in fact, in many cases, families that would benefit from prescription cannabis are actually accessing it from the illegal market because of the extremely high costs and frequent delay in paperwork associated with obtaining cannabis in the legal market. They're doing it because it's the only way they can afford the medicine to help their loved ones—their kids and their families. That should not be the case. We received a promise from the government that this change in the regulation-making power will not see any net increase in the licensing charges for medicinal cannabis. We will, of course, be keeping an eye on those changes to ensure that that doesn't happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: medicinal cannabis can have extraordinarily positive impacts. As we know, it's most commonly prescribed for pain and has an extraordinarily positive impact for many people who are consuming it. I have experience speaking with a number of people—some very close friends—who have had otherwise untreatable pain. That untreatable pain can happen through injury or it can happen through illnesses, such as cancer. They have told me that their only way of addressing that incredible and otherwise untreatable pain has been to access medicinal cannabis. It has provided essential relief at a time when all other medications have failed. We cannot make it harder to get medicinal cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons why I'm aware of the excessive cost of medicinal cannabis is that it is repeatedly communicated to my office through the Sniff Off Facebook page that we run. Sniff Off's primary purpose is to identify where police searches are happening using drug dogs in our public streets—which, of course, is an affront to civil liberties. But it creates a community where people feel free to talk about the impacts of our failing war on drugs. One of the issues that's repeatedly raised is just the sheer, bloody cost of medicinal cannabis, which is making people go and obtain the same product from the black market. We have to make sure that these licensing arrangements don't make it even harder to get medicinal cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Victorian government, the cost of getting access to medicinal cannabis in that state can vary between $50 and $1,000 per patient per week. That depends upon the nature of the condition being treated and the particular product required, as well as the dose. It's hard to imagine how any ordinary family could afford $1,000 a week or even a couple of hundred dollars a week. Why should they be forced to pay anything like that for medication that can be essential to their wellbeing? It may be the only way of treating their pain, the only way of treating their kid's seizures. It's just plain wrong. The Greens are on record as saying that medicinal cannabis, for that reason, should be put on the PBS. If a doctor prescribes it, if it can be life saving or if it's the only available treatment, of course it should be covered by the PBS. We shouldn't see families having to pay that kind of cost for access to medicinal cannabis. The cost of the medicinal cannabis comes on top of going to your local GP—sometimes repeatedly and this is often not bulk-billed—to get the prescriptions for medicinal cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know that cannabis can provide extraordinary benefits. We also know that our current approach to cannabis—of making it an illegal drug—is creating all of these distortions in the market. The answer to those problems doesn't lie in this bill; the answer to those problems lies in actually legalising cannabis for recreational and medicinal purposes in this country. That's the answer. We need to do that sooner rather than later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that this place will have a chance to vote on that next year, when we bring forward a proposal to finally legalise cannabis in this country. I foreshadow, on behalf of the Greens, that we have circulated a second reading amendment which would add the following notation on behalf of the Senate:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(i) in 2020 the Community Affairs References Committee, as part of its inquiry into the current barriers to patient access to medicinal cannabis in Australia, concluded that 'the significant costs associated with accessing medicinal cannabis legally are causing a large number of Australians to purchase or grow illicit cannabis for self-medication', and …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pause to respect the work of that committee. After hearing the evidence, that committee acknowledged and accepted the evidence that we hear repeatedly about the high costs of medicinal cannabis. The second reading amendment also states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(ii) the committee recommended that the Government encourage a review of state and territory criminal legislation in relation to amnesties for the possession and/or cultivation of cannabis for genuine personal medicinal use; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to be clear, it doesn't take it as far as the Greens think we should go, which is to fully legalise cannabis. Let's have that debate next year, let's do it thoroughly and let's do it properly with all the evidence in front of us. But this second reading amendment says that, if you need to access medicinal cannabis for your health and you've got a prescription for it, but you can't afford it and you're therefore forced to get cannabis on the black market, you should not face criminal prosecution for that. You should not face criminal prosecution for getting the drug your doctor says you need in the only way you can afford it. That's why we press that second reading amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I otherwise indicate that we're not opposing the bill, primarily for the reason that the government has given us that assurance that there will be no net increase. I'd like to hear that confirmed on the record by the government in their response—that there will be no net increase in those licensing fees for medicinal cannabis.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I rise to make some brief remarks about the Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Amendment Bill 2022. As a member of this chamber, I have not sought to engage too widely on these matters because I have largely seen them as matters that have been the preserve of the states. I note Senator Shoebridge has a proposal here which is based on advice from the Senate, and I look forward to engaging in that process next year. But it certainly has not been something that I have sought to focus on in the limited time I have had in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say is that I believe the intention of the former health minister, Greg Hunt, was to make it easier for people to get access to medicinal cannabis, to lower the regulatory burden and to reduce costs and complexity so that access is there for people. I note that these are sensitive issues, but I think there is a strong body of medical evidence that there are cases when the only relief available to people for extreme pain is going to be medicinal cannabis. I think we have a problem if people cannot get access to that particular drug when they need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The object of this bill is to build on the changes that were commissioned by the former coalition government to ensure that licence fees and charges are better aligned with the new licensing framework. We accepted all the recommendations of the McMillan review on these matters. This is another down payment on that front. The guiding principle here is that we want people to get access to medicinal cannabis. That is the key point. We don't want people to be pushed into the black market. We want people to be able to access it through an above-the-counter type of approach as much as possible. That will be the test for this bill. We will be supporting it, and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. No doubt we will have further opportunities to debate these matters. I again note my understanding, which could be flawed—we do make mistakes from time to time—that most of these matters in relation to the regulation of these particular arrangements are largely the preserve of the states. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make some brief remarks this morning.</span>

The bill amends the Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Act to clarify that the narcotic drugs licence charges regulation may prescribe matters that will be the subject of multiple separate charges which may be incurred by a licence holder during a particular charging period and to enable a simpler method for working out the amount of charge prescribed. The amendments in the bill are intended to provide sufficient flexibility for the regulations to appropriately prescribe charges supporting the effective recovery of the costs associated with administering the Narcotic Drugs Act. I thank members for their contributions to the debate on this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I welcome the opportunity to re-introduce this bill today, and continue our efforts to get big money out of politics. I acknowledge the important work done on this issue by former Senator Lee Rhiannon and Senator Richard Di Natale, academics and civil society organisations that has assisted in the development of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If passed, this bill would stop dirty industries with a track record of seeking to influence decision-makers through donations—the fossil fuel, banking, defence, pharmaceutical, liquor, tobacco and gambling industries—from making political donations. The bill would also limit the amount that can be donated by individuals and other entities to $3,000 per election term, minimising the opportunity for big money to buy outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has never been a more important time for donation reform. Our democracy is in trouble. Public trust in parliament and politicians is at an all-time low, and the community feels less and less confident that their representatives represent them, rather than doing the bidding of their corporate donors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And it's no wonder. Two hundred and thirty million dollars have flowed in corporate donations to the Labor, Liberal and National parties in the past decade from the big banks, from industries like mining, defence and big pharma, from property developers, and from alcohol, tobacco and gambling companies. These are just some of the industries that have paid the Liberal, National and Labor parties to put their private profits ahead of the needs of our community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These industries are not donating millions of dollars because they believe in the institution of strong democracy. They are donating because it gets results. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens have maintained the www.democracyforsale.org website for over a decade, tracking publicly disclosed political donations and putting a spotlight on influence-peddling. In 2018, the Senate Select Committee on the Political Influence of Donations laid out examples of the nexus between donations made by industry bodies and public policy outcomes or project approvals. The cosy relationships and the proximity of donations and policy outcomes that boost industry profits suggest undue influence. And the community continues to pay the price through climate inaction, propping up destructive gambling practices, and governments that refuse to make corporations pay their fair share of tax so that everyday people can get the education, health care, dental care, and income support that they need. Until we break the hold of dirty donations over the major parties, big corporations will keep winning, and the community loses out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising the corrosive influence that donations from the development sector had had on planning policy, infrastructure, and urban development, Queensland and New South Wales have both legislated to restrict political donations from property developers. The High Court has upheld these restrictions and this bill seeks to extend those to the federal arena. But it also recognises the influence of other key industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2012, the fossil fuel and resources industries have donated over $9 million to both of the major parties. The Australia Institute estimates that in 2021-22 alone Australian governments handed out $11.6 billion in subsidies to fossil fuel giants in grants, loans, cheap fuel and accelerated depreciation that the rest of us don't get. That was $1.3 billion more than in the previous year, despite a COVID crisis that saw so many Australians struggling to make ends meet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rather than turn off the tap, in the most recent budget Labor gifted $1.9 billion of new money for gas in the Northern Territory on top of continuing the nearly $40 million in Morrison government fuel tax credits enjoyed by the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's a pretty good return on investment for fossil fuel donors, and a terrible deal for the rest of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Generous donations bought them a Liberal government completely paralysed by the words 'climate change' at a time when the Australian community faces a future of more extreme bushfires, crippling droughts and floods. Donations continue to cloud the judgment of the Albanese Labor government as new coal and gas projects keep getting approvals and public money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The gas industry donates millions of dollars, so it was no great surprise when the former Prime Minister appointed his gas industry mates to the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission without even declaring their conflicts of interest. It was also no surprise that the Commission ultimately called for a "gas-led recovery" that directly benefits the gas industry, despite strong support for a renewables-led recovery from scientists, economists and policy analysts. Again, the community lost the opportunity for a sustainable recovery because governments are beholden to fossil fuel donors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The cosy relationships and financial support have led to a situation where, despite overwhelming scientific and economic evidence that we will not reach even the weak 43 per cent emissions reduction targets unless we end our attachment to fossil fuels, the Albanese government refuses to rule out any of the 114 coal and gas projects currently under consideration. In fact, they continue to hand out public money to support destructive new projects in the Beetaloo Basin, Scarborough, and more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We saw bullying tactics by the Minerals Council kill the Rudd government's mining super profits tax, and right now we're seeing the Minerals Councils use the same tactics against the Queensland Labor government's current plan to get resources companies to pay their fair share. These threats only work because the major parties rely on donations. The possibility generous donations will be withdrawn is the leverage the industry uses to keep governments in check. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The banking and financial sector is also a regular contributor and beneficiary. The sector has donated about $76 million since 2012 to both sides of politics, and that support secured them immunity for some time despite the evidence of customers being ripped off all over the country. Both of the major parties had to be dragged to the banking royal commission, something the Greens campaigned for since 2014, following scandal after scandal and public backlash over their inaction. How much faster would the commission have happened if the Liberal, National and Labor parties weren't on the payroll of the banks? And would we have seen stronger action in response to the scathing royal commission report?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The gambling industry is another significant donor to state and federal political parties, and their influence can be seen in the deeply entrenched support for poker machines throughout Australia, including exemptions for clubs from COVID restrictions even when so many other venues suffered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Property developers also continue to throw their donations weight around while fighting against planning restrictions, tax reforms, and stronger environmental laws. In Queensland, a destructive proposal for a canal estate within the Ramsar-listed Toondah wetlands should never have gotten past the first hurdle. The department recommended that the project be rejected as "clearly unacceptable". Yet the property developer, Walker Corporation, was a generous political donor and the then minister allowed the deeply flawed proposal to proceed to assessment phase. He even explored the possibility of changing the Ramsar boundaries to accommodate the proposal. I live in hope that the new environment minister will finally reject this destructive proposal, but the local community should never have had to fight so hard for so long against a clearly unacceptable development. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are only the donations that we know about, none of which have been illegal. It doesn't include money paid to attend business forums or cash for access meetings, it ignores exorbitant subscription or membership fees, and it doesn't include money funnelled through representative and fundraising bodies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But regardless of the source or the amount, the obvious expectation from industry is that donations will return results. They're buying outcomes. This feeds the public perception that decisions in this place are made improperly, with self-interest and the interests of donors and mates consistently overriding the public interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In banning political donations from those industries that have a history of seeking to influence policy decisions, the bill implements a key recommendation of the Senate Select Committee into the Political Influence of Donations. It makes it an offence for a prohibited donor to make a donation or solicit another person to make a donation on its behalf. It is also an offence to accept a donation from a prohibited donor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another committee recommendation that this bill seeks to implement is to limit other political donations to $3,000 in an election term. As the High Court recognised in McCloy v NSW, uncontrolled use of wealth to influence decision-making compromises equal participation in democracy. By aggregating and capping political donations made by any person or entity, the bill seeks to level the playing field and avoid those with more money gaining greater access to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will limit donations made for political purposes but is not intended to limit donations made to third parties to support their non-campaign activities. The important work done by civil society organisations must be allowed to continue. We will continue to call for the introduction of electoral expenditure caps to balance the participation of civil society organisations in the political process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, the coalition's Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy was part of our plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The coalition provided a detailed strategy for a technology led approach to reduce transport emissions based on the principles of partnering with the private sector to support uptake and to stimulate co-investment in future fuels; focusing on reducing barriers to the rollout of future fuel technologies, not taxes; and expanding consumer choice by enabling informed choices and by minimising the costs of integration into the grid. And, again, in government, the coalition committed $2.1 billion to help increase the uptake of low- and zero-emission vehicle technologies.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With increasing pressure on inflation, ensuring there's a demonstratable benefit to government expenditure is even more important now than it was before. But this is not what this bill does. As the coalition senators pointed out in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report, most Australians will be unable to benefit from this tax policy change, which is extremely narrow in its application. It will mean that people working in small businesses are less likely to access the proposed tax policy change due to the lower level of use of salary packaging in small and medium businesses. For these reasons, the opposition will not support the government's bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise today to speak about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. Electric vehicles are an absolutely critical part of decarbonising our economy and our society, and in moving Australia to 100 per cent renewable energy and zero-carbon future. That's what we need to do as urgently as possible, because we are in a climate crisis. We know we're in a climate crisis: we have the floods around us at the moment and we had the Black Summer fires three years ago. Around the world, two-thirds of Pakistan is underwater. This is an emergency. We've just had the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the climate 2022</span> report released this week, and it showed what is in front of us unless we tackle our carbon pollution urgently. Australia is in the box seat to be able to do that. We have the technology, the resources and the renewable energy resources; we can shift our energy needs to 100 per cent renewables quickly—probably more quickly than any other country in the world—and yet we have been such laggards over the last eight years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a new government that is taking some small steps forward. The Greens know that we need to go much faster and much further in tackling the climate crisis than this government is, but we will support every small step forward along the way. That's what this bill is: it's one of those small steps forward. Electric vehicles are an incredibly important part of decarbonising our transport system. We're really pleased to say that we have pushed the government further and faster on electric vehicles in our negotiations on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One in every five tonnes of our carbon pollution in Australia comes from transport—20 per cent. We need to get out of dirty, polluting, fossil fuel vehicles and into 100 per cent renewable vehicles as quickly as possible. We also need, of course, to invest in public transport. Most of the trams and trains around the country already run on electricity, at least within suburban areas. If they're being fuelled by renewable energy then we have a zero-carbon public transport system. We also need to be investing in walking and cycling, which are critical parts of our transport mix. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, if you look at what our vision for transport is, the rule of thumb I like to use is about a one-third, one-third, one-third mix of our transport. So you continue to have one-third of private vehicle use to account for all of those trips where you really do need that private vehicle to get you from A to B. If all of those private vehicle trips and road trips—and freight trips as well—are fuelled by renewable energy, then you have zero carbon in that part of the sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you have about one-third on public transport, whether that's within cities or connecting people between cities, like we were talking about yesterday with high-speed rail. Then about one-third of those trips should be walking and cycling, which are the ultimate zero-carbon trips, where you just get out there. For cycling, it could be on bikes that are human powered, which I am a great advocate of, commuter cycling, to get around everywhere, or on electric bikes, which mean that the benefits of cycling are available to a wider range of people for a greater number and length of trips. That one-third, one-third, one-third mix means we can focus on rapidly shifting away from dirty polluting vehicles to clean electric vehicles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will take some small steps. It will be tackling the fact that, at the moment, if you're a fleet owner, it is very expensive to be converting your fleet to electric vehicles. This will make it easier and give tax discounts, to make it more affordable for fleets to be electric vehicles. We are really pleased in what we have been able to do with this bill, in negotiations with the government, of saying that we want to be shifting those fleets to electric vehicles. Originally, this bill included plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which are fake electric vehicles, because we know those plug-in hybrids aren't electric vehicles. They are not renewable. About half of the use of those plug-in hybrid vehicles is still running on dirty fossil fuels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have negotiated with the government—and there will be an amendment that both the Greens and Senator David Pocock put forward in our negotiations with the government—is that those plug-in hybrids will be phased out. There will be a sunset clause so that they will only be included under these tax discounts for three years. We think that's a reasonable compromise, because we know there is a shortage of electric vehicles in this country at the moment. We've been such laggards that the electric vehicle manufacturers haven't wanted to bring their electric vehicles to Australia. So because there's an issue of increasing the availability of electric vehicles, we'll allow plug-in hybrids for the next three years, but phase them out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the next three years there should be no need for anybody to have plug-in hybrids and people should be encouraged, supported, if they're needing to buy a vehicle for it to be an electric vehicle. We know that countries in Europe have phase-out dates of 2030, for all new cars to be electric vehicles. So phasing out subsidies and support for plug-in hybrids in three years time is a pretty reasonable and modest thing to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other key thing that we have negotiated with the government, with this bill, is a commitment that all of the Commonwealth fleet procurement will be 100 per cent electric, which is amazing and pretty significant. If you have fleet requirements where currently there isn't the recharging infrastructure available, there will be exceptional circumstances, where those vehicles, within the Commonwealth fleet, could be plug-in hybrids. But the default is that Commonwealth procurement and the Commonwealth fleet will become electric as quickly as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is that good for Commonwealth vehicles but it means we can shift all of those kilometres to 100 per cent renewable as soon as those electric vehicles are in the fleet. It also means that, because they will be in the fleet, there will be a greater availability of second-hand electric vehicles in the market, which is important. We know that, as cars move out of fleets, they've still got a lot of life left in them and it's more affordable for people to purchase a second-hand vehicle, so this is going to make a really critical difference and make electric vehicles more affordable for everybody across the country. That'll be the case when you've got a good stream of second-hand electric vehicles, rather than the case at the moment when most of the second-hand electric vehicles that people are purchasing are being imported. Having that steady stream of electric vehicles from the Commonwealth fleet is going to be incredibly significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the other thing about excluding the plug-in hybrids from the Commonwealth fleet is that that will save the Commonwealth a lot of money because continuing to subsidise the use of plug-in hybrids means that you are continuing to subsidise having to fuel them with petrol and diesel. It's going to save the Department of Finance a lot of money—in fact, the estimate is that the amendments that are to be moved by me and Senator David Pocock will save the government up to $935 million over a decade. That's almost a billion dollars compared with what the government first proposed. That means we won't be permanently baking in yet another fossil fuel subsidy on top of the fossil fuel subsidies that are continuing—$40 million and counting on the pile of handouts to the coal, gas and oil sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to those subsidies, in talking about transport, moving on the diesel fuel rebate would be such an easy thing to do. At the moment we are subsidising the use of diesel fuel, which is just crazy. At the same time as we're saying we need to do something about the climate crisis, we are still giving massive handouts to subsidise the use of polluting diesel fuel. Imagine if, instead of spending almost a billion dollars on subsidising diesel fuel, we had more incentives to encourage the heavy-vehicle freight industry to shift their fleet to 100 per cent renewable vehicles, to electric and hydrogen vehicles. We have plenty of heavy movers, trucks and trains that are currently running on diesel in Australia, but there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world—and, in fact, beginning in Australia—of electric heavy movers and hydrogen run trains, so it is possible. It just needs the political will and the incentives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than incentivising the pollution, incentivising the things that are absolutely turbocharging the climate crisis, we should be incentivising the solutions and supporting the rapid transition to 100 per cent clean energy. You might want to spend some of the $935 million on charging infrastructure in the regions, for example, so that it is really easy for people to charge their electric vehicles no matter where they are. We know that, with charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, it's going to be straightforward, it's going to be viable, it's going to be economic for the private sector to put charging infrastructure in the cities. But out there in the regions there will need to be more government support for charging infrastructure. There is a need for more investment in charging infrastructure, particularly government investment in charging infrastructure, in the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start of my contribution, this is a small step forward that the Greens are happy to support. But it's not a revolutionary one. It's an improvement on the status quo, and it's going to benefit, in addition to Commonwealth and government fleets, a very narrow class of employees by creating incentives for companies to buy electric vehicles. Through our negotiations, it creates those incentives for the Commonwealth fleet too. These measures will increase the supply of affordable second-hand EVs in the market. But for your average person who hasn't got a vehicle through their employer, is not doing salary sacrifice—they work for a small business or there is no connection between who they work for and the vehicle they drive—we need a whole range of other things to make electric vehicles more affordable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big piece of the puzzle, which is yet to come and we urge the government to take urgent action on, is implementing vehicle emissions standards so that we, frankly, are not able to sell polluting vehicles in this country. Those vehicles are going to continue to fuel the climate crisis, and we need to have vehicle emissions standards and CO2 standards—and we need to ramp them up over time—so that within a pretty short space of time all vehicles have to be 100 per cent non-polluting, zero carbon. This is what urgently needs to happen, and actually introducing those vehicle emissions standards is critical and urgent. It's a policy that the Greens have been championing over the years, and we are going to continue to bring it into the parliament. That is what is going to drive the supply of electric vehicles here in Australia, and without it we know that manufacturers are sending their electric vehicles elsewhere because they're not seeing anything to support the rapid uptake of electric vehicles here. It's a difficult market, so, in a time of constrained supply, they just say, 'We'll send them elsewhere,' where they know the market is stronger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got a message for the government: we will support this bill, but we want to see a really thorough electric vehicle strategy that takes the serious action that's needed; that doesn't include fake electric vehicles, the plug-in hybrids, as part of it; and that really takes seriously the role of transport and transforming our transport and vehicle fleet to 100 per cent clean energy. That's what's needed. That's what the Greens are going to continue to push for. We know that's where we need to head as quickly as possible to tackle the role that our transport system is playing in the climate crisis and the role that it can play in effectively tackling the climate crisis.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. Does anyone remember, during the 2019 election, federal Labor's attempt to end the weekend? Well, they've only been in office for a little while and here they are at it. I'm going to explain to you why, because no-one so far has given any explanation as to how we're going to solve this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia is known for its wonderful outdoor lifestyle. Whether it's during school holidays or over the long weekend, many Western Australians, including me, hitch up a caravan or a camper trailer and head out to the great outdoors. There's no better way to see and experience Western Australia than on a road trip with a caravan in tow, whether that be into the state's beautiful south-west or up the coast to somewhere like Exmouth, both trips that I've undertaken in the last year or so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the RAC published an article entitled 'Can an electric car tow a caravan or boat?' Naturally, I took an interest in this. Could this article point to the future of family weekend travel? The article outlined the virtues and merits of electric vehicles and the advantages and disadvantages of towing with an EV. However, two lines stood out to me, and they go to the core of the discussion that we're having here today. One quote from the article said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In principle, an EV is well suited to towing, albeit with limitations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it says of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… they may be better suited to occasional towing rather than long distance adventures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one thing for inner-city members in this place to preach that everyone should be driving EVs. That makes a lot of sense if all you're doing is taking a short drive, if you're driving a passenger vehicle to somewhere like Byron Bay for the long weekend to visit the beach house. If that's all the driving you do, then, yes, it would seem as if everyone else should be doing that too. But it disregards the everyday practicalities of working families whose only annual luxury might be lugging a camper trailer up the highway for a couple of days away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An EV might be capable of towing a boat to the Cockburn boat ramp 15 kilometres away, but what about towing that boat from Perth down to Busselton, more than 200 kilometres away? EV technology—more specifically, the capacity of EV batteries and the speed of charging—is simply impractical for anything other than city driving. It's another example of ideology blinding peoples' sensibility and reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was much publicity in California around its ban on the sale of petrol vehicles by the year 2035. Its own clean vehicle incentive program offers rebates of as much as US$7,000 towards the cost of zero-emission vehicles, although cars costing more than US$45,000 do not qualify. Ironically, a mere week after the announcement, the California Independent System Operator put out a statewide alert to conserve energy, including a request to avoid charging electric vehicles in order to prevent strain on the state's power grid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia we have a government wanting to put more stress on an energy grid which is not currently equipped to deal with it. I can only imagine the surge in energy consumption if every Australian were forced to drive an EV and they arrived home between 5 and 6 pm and all plugged in at the same time, at a time of day when solar power generation is waning—which, incidentally, is why the government needs to be careful when considering subsidies and incentives for home charging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The average consumer does not actually need a fast charger. I know this. I actually own an EV, people, so I'm not against EVs. But the average consumer does not actually need a fast charger. A 10-amp charger will recharge an average EV from 50 to 80 per cent overnight with no problem. Just because you can fast charge doesn't mean that you should. It makes no sense for everyone to plug in and charge quickly, which would put more demand on the grid, when the vehicle can be plugged in and charged overnight. So we must be careful when we're thinking about the infrastructure that we will be putting in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of us who are camping enthusiasts—and, as I've said, I'm one—the gross combined mass of a vehicle is one of most important specifications to look for in a tow vehicle. This measurement refers to the maximum weight that a vehicle can tow safely. Staying within your vehicle's towing capacity is particularly important when you're using an electric vehicle, as the more energy an EV expends the sooner it must be recharged. It's the basic law of physics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Knowing your vehicle's towing capacity and range is even more critical when driving in remote areas or heading on a trip to the Western Australian north-west, where towns are few and far between and using charging stations becomes more challenging. What was once a 10-minute exercise to fuel up and grab a coffee at a roadhouse could turn into an exercise of hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some on the other side may say, 'Well, only 10 per cent of Australians might hook up a caravan or a heavy load on the weekend.' My response to that is: if Labor wants to penalise those in that 10 per cent and add further pressures to their everyday cost of living for simply having the temerity to own a camper trailer, then it needs to be upfront with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I read with interest the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' submission to the inquiry into this bill. The study that the FCAI commissioned found that, if a 100 per cent battery electric mandate were to be put in place by 2030, an entry level car would go up by $12,500, and Australian drivers after a mid-sized SUV would need to increase their budget by $10,000.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to some science and facts. You don't need to like these facts, but they are constrained by the laws of physics. There is no development of the laws of physics. They are what they are. We can try to master them, but we can't defy them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what disturbs me in the EV and broader climate change debate is that there is a real, significant lack of scientific literacy and realistic projections. Current generation lithium iron phosphate batteries have a gravimetric energy density of approximately 150 watt-hours per kilogram. Now, diesel and petrol have a gravimetric energy density of 12,700 watt-hours per kilogram—nearly 85 times the weight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, granted, EVs use their stored energy more efficiently than do internal combustion engine vehicles. Think of the wasted heat that radiates from an internal combustion engine car. An EV converts about 90 per cent of the energy stored in the battery into motion, whereas an ICE vehicle converts only about 20 per cent of its energy into motion and the rest is wasted as heat and through other mechanical losses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the issue here is the weight and mass of the battery. In order to get the payload capability in an EV equivalent to an ICE vehicle, you need a battery that weighs about 60 times the weight of the fuel that would otherwise be stored in the vehicle's fuel tank. Why is this important? A small-to-medium battery EV practically makes perfect sense for people who are just commuting around the city. A model 3 Tesla has a 60 kilowatt-hour battery. This battery weighs 460 kilograms. EVs bigger than this really start to become impractical and, arguably, economically irrational.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take, for example, the F-150 Lightning dual cab, which you can currently buy only in the USA. This big American truck is super impressive. I'd love to drive one; I reckon it would be really exciting. The big problem is that the battery weighs 817 kilograms. Even with this enormous battery, the standard-range F-150 Lightning is only equivalent to that from 18 litres of fuel. This means that the range is severely limited, especially if you load it up—let alone hook up a trailer, boat or caravan to it. Anyone who has ever towed anything marginally heavy will know that as soon as you hook it up your range is more than halved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Case studies in the US have demonstrated that the real-world range capability of an F-150 Lightning when loaded up is about 100 kilometres. Imagine driving from Perth to Exmouth: 13 times on the trip you would have to pull over for three hours, and that is assuming that you've got a fast charger at the roadhouse. It's simply not going to be possible. To get the range capability of a diesel powered vehicle, you would need a battery nearly four times the size of the one that is currently in the F-150 Lightning. This is completely unworkable. It would be ridiculously expensive, would weigh too much and wouldn't even fit within the form factor of the vehicle itself. Imagine the extra wear and tear on the road, the safety implications if you had an accident and the extra wear and tear on the tyres and brakes—not to mention the insane amount of raw material required to make these batteries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, small-to-medium electric vehicles make sense. They don't have to carry a big payload and, for the most part, if they're used in and around town, their batteries can be topped up overnight. But four-wheel drive SUV and ute EVs don't make a lot of sense, unless of course you don't intend to go big distances using their payload capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some may say that battery and charging technology will improve. I've been looking into this and I'm disappointed to have to tell them that there is nothing, even on the periphery of battery science development, that promises to increase the energy density by a factor that makes them a practical replacement for a larger vehicle. This is why, for now, a hybrid actually makes sense. Let's face it: most owners of dual cabs and four-wheel drives are not loading them up or towing over big distances for 365 days of the year. So having a small battery which will cover the short commutes and be recharged daily, backed up by a small internal combustion engine for those occasional longer and loaded-up drives, makes sense over the short-to-medium term. Why is this an issue? The latest figures from the Australia Chamber of Automotive Industries show that the biggest-selling vehicles are dual cabs and four-wheel drives. These are the vehicles that Australians want, and someone actually needs to be upfront with them if Australians are to be expected to change their buying habits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the amendment proposed by others to sunset the inclusion of plug-in hybrids in this FBT-exemption bill. While the coalition don't support the bill—because we don't believe in just providing subsidies to the wealthy to enable them to buy electric vehicles while poorer people or those on lower incomes, particularly in the outer suburbs and regional areas, won't be able to afford it—I have to say that this amendment is actually sending the wrong message. If the purposes of this bill are to increase the uptake of EVs and get high-emissions vehicles off the road, then ensuring that hybrids are off the road, that they're not going to be part of this, is sending the wrong message. It doesn't actually deal with the reality, particularly the uniquely Australian reality. The most popular vehicle in Europe—I can't remember the name of the car—is basically the size of a Corolla; it's a small vehicle. Here in Australia, the most popular vehicle is a HiLux and the second most popular is a Ranger. Then we have the RAV4 and, further down the list, the D-MAX. Four of the top 10 best-selling vehicles, by a long way, are four-wheel drives and dual-cab utes. So those opposite are sending the wrong message to people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A subsidy—make no mistake about it; that's what this is—for electric cars, the owners of which will then fail to contribute to road maintenance by avoiding taxes, is emblematic of this modern Labor Party. This is a policy that will achieve no environmental benefit. It will give a tax break to the wealthy, hurt everyday Australians and be widely impractical; in short, it checks all the boxes of the ALP policy handbook. There's no doubt that Australians will adopt EVs.</span>

She no longer has to visit a petrol station—she plugs it in every night, and it's absolutely fantastic. I've been driving it, and it's an excellent vehicle. It drives better than any other vehicle I've driven. It's great. But the reality is that many Australians like to recreate and to get out and about in the regions towing their caravans and their boats that these vehicles might have the capacity to tow. The F-150 can tow four tons—or possibly even 4½ tons—but if you can tow it for only 100 kilometres, it doesn't suit the Australian lifestyle or landscape.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to think more seriously about this. We can't just have policies driven by inner-city MPs, inner-city elites who don't think about it. I had someone recently say to me, 'Maybe they just need to change what type of vehicle they need to buy.' Be upfront with the Australian people that that's what you're expecting them to do! Don't just create these policies that will impose on them without being upfront. Minister Bowen, the member for McMahon, went over to America and took a photo in front of an F-150 Lightning at a Ford dealership, saying, 'They said we were going to ruin the weekend, but this car can tow big loads.' But guess what? It can tow only 100 kilometres.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. I'll start with a framing of where we're at. We're facing a climate crisis. We turn on the news and see the results of that every day. It's not going to get better. Clearly, Australia has to lift its game when it comes to the transition away from fossil fuels to a clean energy future. Australians are also faced with a cost-of-living crisis where households across the country are having to make really tough decisions, when it comes to their weekly budgets, on what they spend money on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Electrification is a huge opportunity not only for Australia but also, at a household level, for households to save money. If you look at rooftop solar in Australia, we now have some of the cheapest—if not the cheapest—rooftop solar in the world. Australian households are benefiting from that. They continue to install solar and reap the benefits of lower power bills. That policy started under the Howard government, and has had bipartisan support in developing the certification systems, bringing down the price of installation, and putting into practice the work and amazing innovation of some of our best scientists in Australia to improve the efficiency of solar PV cells.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, Australians want electric vehicles. The demand far outstrips supply. It's no surprise that Australians want electric vehicles. According to the Australian Automobile Association, households spend more than $100 on average per week on fuel. That's more than $5,000 a year every year. The recent restoration of the full fuel excise charge will ensure that prices remain high for petrol and diesel. That money that Australians spend on fuel doesn't stay in Australia. Most of the tens of billions of dollars spent on fuel flows back to oil-producing countries. It's bad not only for the economy but also for our energy security. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has reported that our fuel stockpile has been as low as 20 days in recent years, well below the 90-day requirement set by the International Energy Agency. It's no wonder that Chris Barrie, former Chief of the Defence Force, said that climate change is the greatest threat to our national security. And yet we continue to power our cars with dirty, imported fuel from insecure supply chains, rather than from clean Australian wind and sunshine—sunshine that can be captured on your roof at home and put into your electric vehicle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rest of the developed world have seen the writing on the wall and have been shifting to electric vehicles at pace. In Europe, EV sales make up 17 per cent of the market now. In countries like Norway it's as high as 86 per cent. Even in the fuel-hungry United States, electric-vehicle sales now make up more than six per cent of the market. Here in Australia, electric vehicles make up two per cent of the market, at least for the figures we have for last year. Slow adoption of EVs is costing Australians money. It's costing Australians money every time they go to the fuel pump, and it is causing damage to our climate. We have to look at the transition to EVs in the context of climate change. This is something that we have to rapidly speed up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bulk of the 18.6 per cent of Australia's total emissions due to transport come from light vehicles. Our cars are highly polluting. The average Australian car is 45 per cent more emissions-intensive than the European equivalent. If we're to reach net zero by 2050, we clearly have to do better and we have to move fast. Research by the Grattan Institute shows that, to get to net zero, EVs need to make up 100 per cent of light vehicle sales by 2035 at the latest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are ready to make the change. Earlier this month, an NRMA survey showed that 57 per cent of respondents would consider purchasing an EV. But, as we all know, one significant issue is that there is a shortfall in supply. In the ACT, the wait on a Hyundai Kona is now 12 months. Manufacturers like Hyundai don't want to send great numbers of affordable electric vehicles to Australia, because it's currently not an attractive market. Why is that? It's because we continue to see scaremongering and still have poor policy settings that make us a dumping ground for a whole range of inefficient clunkers that we see on the road. Leadership and action is needed to move us from the back of the queue up to the front of the queue when it comes to electric vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By far the biggest issue that we need to deal with to change that is to have fuel efficiency standards. Australia is one of only two OECD countries that do not have fuel efficiency standards. The other country is Russia. In 2014, the Climate Change Authority under the Abbott government recommended introducing fuel efficiency standards, and modelling shows that the standard would have had a net benefit to the economy of $13.9 billion had that recommendation been implemented by policymakers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to act now. We have an opportunity to act and to start realising this benefit. It's great to see Minister Bowen and the government commit to fuel efficiency standards to drive the change that we need. We need independent, robust and ambitious fuel efficiency standards. We need them to ensure that these standards have integrity. They need to be mandatory to ensure standards apply fairly across different manufacturers, and they must be based on real-world driving patterns. Recent research of SUVs in Sydney shows that actual emissions are up to 65 per cent higher than claimed by manufacturers. Indeed, we've seen in the news over recent history vehicle manufacturers being caught out for fudging the numbers. The same standard should be implemented for all passenger vehicles without exception. Finally, it should be based on and monitored by independent and publicly accessible data. I'll continue to work to encourage the government to move swiftly to bring on these fuel efficiency standards that have integrity, alongside a world-class fuel efficiency standard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to move quickly to improve EV charging infrastructure across the country. In our cities many people are renting or are in apartment buildings without charging infrastructure. In regional and remote Australia, range anxiety acts as a barrier to the uptake of electric vehicles.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I'm speaking in continuance from the debate last night, and I'd like to conclude my remarks on the Atomic Energy Amendment (Mine Rehabilitation and Closure) Bill 2022. The coalition supports the development of other industries in the Kakadu area, including Jabiru, to supplement the loss of investment caused by the close-out of Ranger and to ensure opportunities for sustainable, tangible economic growth. Development in our regions is paramount for our nation's future, as is creating opportunities for Indigenous communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, the coalition supports the continued rehabilitation of the Ranger site and supports the progress of this bill to ensure that Energy Resources of Australia is able to continue its rehabilitation operations and monitoring. To secure future rehabilitation of the Ranger site, it is imperative that this bill passes to allow relevant stakeholders to commence negotiations on the next stages of the overall process. As referenced by CEO Brad Welsh, ERA therefore urges the parliament to consider this bill as a matter of urgency and well in advance of 23 November 2022 so that the bill can preferably be passed by parliament this calendar year. This will allow ERA and the traditional owners to move forward with their agreement negotiations with the Commonwealth and enable ERA to plan, with certainty, the world-class rehabilitation of the RPA. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I rise to support the Atomic Energy Amendment (Mine Rehabilitation and Closure) Bill 2022 as it demonstrates that the coalition are certainly responsible and dedicated to balancing economic and environmental management. I commend this bill to the Senate, knowing that the coalition began the process of engaging with Energy Resources of Australia over the rehabilitation of the Ranger mine under the previous government. I personally, in a former professional capacity, worked closely with the Mirarr people, the traditional owners, in terms of their connection with the Ranger mine. The Atomic Energy Amendment (Mine Rehabilitation and Closure) Bill 2022 supports all mine rehabilitation being completed to high standards. The current framework allows for ERA to undertake remediation work until January 2026.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 1999 an agreement was reached between the Commonwealth government and ERA that, upon the completion of mining activities at the Ranger mine site in the Northern Territory, ERA would take charge of the rehabilitation of the Ranger mine site. Mining at Ranger ceased in January 2021, and remediation is already underway—and rightly so. More than 20 years ago it was believed that ERA would need only five years to complete the rehabilitation work on the site. This bill extends the legislative framework surrounding the rehabilitation, ensuring that ERA can complete this very important work to close out the site, continue monitoring and return the land, of course, to the Mirarr people, the traditional owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill's primary purpose is to enable the long-term remediation and monitoring of the site. Australia has some of the most stringent environmental and rehabilitative standards and processes in the world, despite what many environmentalists would argue, and supports ERA fulfilling their obligation to properly remediate the Ranger mine site. The Ranger Uranium Mine has served the country well over its years of operation, creating economic benefits for the country and local community and providing jobs and employment services to the local population and within the Northern Territory itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Traditional owners, the Northern Land Council and other Northern Territory bodies are supportive of this bill and have expressed their support for ERA fulfilling their obligations set out under the Atomic Energy Act to rehabilitate the Ranger mine site. The coalition began the process of engaging with ERA over the rehabilitation of Ranger mine under the previous government and supports this bill proceeding in order to guarantee Ranger can be fully rehabilitated by ERA over the coming years. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I rise to speak on the Atomic Energy Amendment (Mine Rehabilitation and Closure) Bill 2022. Ranger mine sits east of Darwin, smack bang in the middle of Kakadu National Park, a World Heritage listed site for its exceptional natural and cultural values. Kakadu has been home to First Nations people for over 50,000 years, and it is full of beautiful rock art, sacred sites, tidal flats and flood plains and provides a home for a wide range of rare species of animals and plants. It is a precious place, unlike any other in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, in 1980 mining operations by Energy Resources of Australia—or ERA, as it's commonly referred to—began at Ranger after the uranium deposit was discovered in 1969. Ranger mine ceased operations in January 2021, and in just over 40 years the mine had produced more than 130,000 tonnes of naturally radioactive triuranium octoxide—which is known as yellowcake—to be exported. This mine was established against the wishes of the traditional owners. In such a culturally and ecologically significant area, ERA were allowed to come in, bring their big machines and dig up dangerous and radioactive materials. In doing so they changed the landscape and the cultural heritage of the place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's done is done, but it's important to highlight that what we are considering today is the result of colonialism and corporate interest being considered more important than First Nations culture. ERA did not obtain consent from the traditional owners in any sense of the word, let alone in the context of free, prior and informed consent, which is paramount in respecting the sovereignty of traditional owners and their cultural heritage. This place must pass the Australian Greens bill to legislate our obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which includes the principle of free, prior and informed consent. It's, frankly, embarrassing that this government and previous governments have made zero effort to legislate these commitments. But I think we all know why, and if this government is serious about giving First Nations people a voice, as it claims to be, it has to walk the walk and it has to support our bill. The principles of my colleague's bill are intrinsically linked to what we are considering here in this chamber today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that uranium is radioactive. We have all seen the impacts that exposure to radiation can have. We've seen the devastating impacts of the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan in World War II and the disasters of Chernobyl and Fukushima. And we've anxiously heard the recent threats from Russia. Whilst Australia has strict regulations around the use of Australian uranium to ensure it's not used in nuclear weapons and legislation at both federal and state and territory levels prohibits the use of nuclear energy at varying degrees, the fact that we are still mining and exporting uranium sends a very different message. In fact, it's hypocritical—we do not want it in our country, but we are happy to supply it to other countries. Clearly our concerns can be ignored if there's a nice pay cheque attached to the end of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might tell yourself that's all fine because we learned from the catastrophes and we have appropriate safeguards in place to protect workers and people in the surrounding areas, right? In 2004, the supervising scientists at Ranger found the ERA had breached their environmental requirements in an incident where water was contaminated with uranium, leading to 28 workers falling ill. In 2013, a 1,400-cubic-metre tank of uranium oxide slurry and acid actually collapsed. In June this year, low-level radioactive waste was found in an excavator at Winnellie, some 275 kilometres away from the mine, after being transported through Kakadu National Park. This was considered a significant breach of the environmental plan due to the risk to both people and the environment. This was just at Ranger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two other uranium mines in Australia—Olympic Dam and Four Mile. Both are in South Australia. I don't even want to get started on the nuclear waste dump in Kimba, which has seen significant opposition from locals and the traditional owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, traditional owners are fighting uranium mining all over this country. In Western Australia, the Upurli Upurli people are facing the threat of mining of uranium at Mulga Rock, which would be WA's first uranium mine. The company involved in this mining proposal, Deep Yellow, had connections with Rio Tinto at the time of the Juukan caves explosion and Paladin, who have a very concerning past. They include spills from uranium mines into nearby lakes, workers dying and getting sick, and workers striking over pay and work conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday morning we heard the British Prime Minister announce that Australian nuclear test veterans and scientists involved in the British nuclear testing at Maralinga, Emu Field and the Montebello Islands will receive a newly introduced service medal to mark 70 years since the first nuclear test across the Commonwealth. These tests devastated First Nations communities in the area, most of whom were displaced by these tests. This is the legacy of nuclear and uranium mining: destruction, death and displacement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People working in uranium mines have a higher rate of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, such as tuberculosis and emphysema, due to the dust that they may inhale as well as the radioactive inert gas radon, which is released when the ore is mined and crushed. Through the mining of uranium, not only are we damaging the environment and eroding cultural heritage at the same time but we are putting the health of workers and inhabitants in the area at risk. In particular at Mulga Rock there are concerns that I have heard from the traditional owners that the dust will fall into the plants that kangaroos and other animals eat and which are eaten, in fact, by the traditional owners in that area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this weren't bad enough, some of the shareholders from ERA were pushing for the company to reopen more uranium mines, particularly the one at Ranger. This, again, is against the wishes of traditional owners, who were opposed to the Ranger mine way back then, 40 years ago, and they are opposed to any further mines now. One of the shareholders was quoted as saying, 'It is in the best interests of all shareholders to give the Mirarr and the Northern Territory Land Council about 10 per cent of ERA and give them a seat on the board.' What is truly in the best interests of the Mirarr is ERA respecting their opposition to the destruction of their land and simply going off into the sunset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cultural heritage is not something that you can put a price tag on. The sheer arrogance of whitefellas telling First Nations people what is best for us will never cease to amaze me. I've been very pleased to see these proposals shut down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the Greens want Ranger to be rehabilitated. We acknowledge that the unique legislative framework that Ranger sits under has some of the best rehabilitation standards in the country. They are arguably better than the EPBC Act, although that does more to show how inadequate our current environmental act is than show how good those standards are. We acknowledge that the unique legislative framework currently allows ERA access to the site until 2026 and that these changes are necessary to allow them more access to the land to complete rehabilitation beyond that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee—and I want to acknowledge the work of the Acting Deputy President today, Senator Walsh, in her role as the chair—and a hearing was held in October, which I participated in, where we heard from various stakeholders, most notably ERA and the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, who represent the traditional owners. I, along with others, was pleased to hear about the level of involvement of traditional owners in the rehabilitation, including consultation for this bill and committee memberships relating to the rehabilitation but also extending to the procurement of contracts and ensuring the rehabilitation will support the post-closure land use requirements, allowing traditional owners to reconnect to their country—a connection that has been disrupted because of this mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is paramount that traditional owners are deeply involved in every process of the rehabilitation of our own land, because we know the land. We know where things should be—trees, waterholes, grasses. We hold this knowledge, and it is passed down from our ancestors. It is our land, after all. This land will need to be managed for a long time, due to the potential radiation risks. This management will likely continue long after the companies have left, but these communities are the ones who will remain. It is these families who have lived there throughout the lifespan of the mine and will continue to be there long after. These are the people who need to be deeply entrenched in the rehabilitation process and should also be benefiting from it economically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been issues raised about the cost of the rehabilitation, which is more than double what was originally estimated. Rehabilitation costs are currently sitting between $1.6 billion and $2.2 billion. This price tag could make Ranger the biggest rehabilitation exercise in the history of Australian mining. Ranger not being rehabilitated is in fact not an option. We cannot afford to have this mine abandoned or for ERA to pass this debt onto the government after profiting from this mine for 40 years. The rehabilitation of a mine is equally important as, if not more than, mining itself, and it must be treated as such. It should be the first part of an approval process of all mining licences in this country. Rio Tinto owns 86 per cent of ERA. Rio Tinto's annual profit in 2020-21 was $53.538 billion, so a price tag of $2.2 billion for rehabilitation is just a drop in the ocean for them. They've stated that they are committed to funding the rehabilitation of Ranger should ERA fail to do so, although we heard at the inquiry into this bill that there's no binding agreement between ERA and Rio Tinto that will require Rio to step in should that need arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support this bill, which will ultimately give the Mirarr their land back, but we hold some serious concerns about the funding of this rehabilitation. I look forward to working with the government to ensure that companies are held responsible to clean up the mess they create.</span>

These amendments put in place a number of measures important for securing the rehabilitation and eventual closure of the Ranger Uranium Mine in the Northern Territory. This is a goal shared by government, the mine's operator and the traditional owners. Amendments will ensure Energy Resources of Australia, ERA, Ranger's longstanding operator, remains authorised to conduct approved rehabilitation and monitoring activities at Ranger for as long as it is needed and for ERA to demonstrate it has achieved the high standards of environmental rehabilitation that have long applied to the site. I'm glad that the bill enjoys bipartisan support and was recommended by the Economics Legislation Committee to pass. I know all those in the chamber recognise Ranger rehabilitation as a priority and look forward to Ranger becoming a world-class example of mine rehabilitation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South </span><span class="HPS-Electorate">Wales</span>—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  Our veterans are important. Their service was important, and parliamentarians in both houses in this place and on both sides recognise the contribution they have made. That is why the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022 is important and that is why the opposition will be supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides an increase to the totally and permanently incapacitated payment that is given to our veterans by $38.46, which will increase it to $1,595.66 per fortnight. That provides an annual increase of around $1,000, which is not much in the scheme of things and not much when you consider the service our veterans have provided. The bill achieves this by amending the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to increase the rate of pension payable to TPI veterans. It will make the payment comparable to the national minimum wage and make it only just greater than the after-tax payment of the minimum wage that an earner would receive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the TPI is a payment that is provided to veterans for life, unless their circumstances are deemed to have changed. It is not taxable and it is not included in a means test for other income support payments. It was formally called the disability compensation payment at the special rate and is offered when a veteran's injuries from war or service are assessed under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 as preventing them from having a normal work life. And it's the least we can afford these people, who put their hand up to serve in the defence of our nation and our way of life. It is paid to those who have been injured through that service, and, as I said, it's the least we can do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider this extra $1,000 a year, given the current cost-of-living increases and the pressures that people are facing, the rises in grocery bills, rents, mortgages and, as we have all seen, power prices—and the absolute disbandment of the new government to deliver on their $275 decrease to those power bills. As soon as they got into government, they ran away from that as fast as Usain Bolt runs. They disbanded that promise and walked away from it. This $1,000 increase to the TPI payments will barely touch the sides. Hopefully it will help our veterans meet rising daily living costs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">TPI veterans also receive the veteran gold card, which provides cover for all their clinically required treatment of medical conditions, and this increase to the TPI payments will not impact on that at all. While we know that the wheels of government can turn slowly, I thank the government for bringing this bill into this place in time so that the legislation can be enacted to start the payments from 1 January 2023. It is an important process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are around 27,000 TPI recipients across Australia. While we've this bill today, we know there is so much more we can and need to do to assist our whole veteran community. Over the years there have been many inquiries and reports. Most recently we've had the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, and they recently delivered an interim report which went through all of those past inquiries. They noted the considerable number of reports and the multiple recommendations that have been made across several governments—from both sides. The commissioners identified over 50 reports, with more than 750 recommendations. While they acknowledge that many of the reports and inquiries were about discrete topics, they were dismayed to learn the limited ways that governments from all sides have responded to the recommendations of these inquiries. So we know we have to do better, and, when the veterans royal commission currently underway reports, I hope that all sides look at those recommendations very seriously to consider how best to implement the recommendations to ensure we do better by our veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when our veterans transition out of the Defence Force they often feel isolated. They often feel that they've lost their purpose. There are bodies and agencies out there for support—the Returned &amp; Services League and Soldier On, amongst others—and I met with another organisation the other day, which is quite a young organisation in the scheme of things: Disaster Relief Australia, founded in 2016. It's very topical at this point in time as we're seeing such devastating flood crises across the eastern seaboard, particularly in New South Wales. Disaster Relief Australia works with veterans who volunteer their time to be deployed, to use the military term, into a disaster-hit area, where they use the skills that they learnt through the Defence Force and help coordinate relief and response, working with communities, bringing everyone together and managing logistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disaster Relief Australia have found that, for many of the veterans they work with, this is giving them back that sense of purpose. It is having a really good outcome amongst the veteran population that they work with, not because they're going out and saying to veterans, 'How can we help you?' but because they're going to veterans and saying, 'How can you help others?' That is what our Defence Force personnel are so good at doing. They sign up not to get something for themselves but to do something for others. That is why it is such an important thing. And we need to look at other ways we can support our veterans to give them back that sense of purpose and to give them back that sense of community that we provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that veterans who've been medically discharged, who've been found to be totally and permanently incapacitated, often struggle the most because they entered the Defence Force fit, healthy and robust—you've got to pass a medical to enter the Defence Force—and they came out the other side with a TPI label. For many of them, that's devastating. Many of them depend on these payments to put food on the table and to meet the costs of their daily living expenses. We do need to ensure that those payments keep up with the cost of living. We need to ensure that our TPI veterans are not left behind and that they know that we in this parliament and in this chamber value their service. On average one Australian veteran commits suicide every two weeks, and that is a statistic that should not be happening in a country that claims to value the contribution and sacrifice made by defence members and veterans and the sacrifice their families have made. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this bill will deliver an annual $1,000 extra to our TPI recipients, but that is only a tiny gesture in recognition of the value of those veterans. It is a small step in showing that they are valued and that they will not be forgotten. The opposition supported this bill through the House of Representatives and we support it in this chamber. I thank the government for ensuring this bill will be passed in time to start these payments from January 2023 to give our TPI veterans recognition and some financial security and certainty moving forward.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Greens to indicate that we'll be supporting the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022. But we do so with significant reservations. This bill will introduce amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act to implement what the government said they would do with disability compensation payments. The government made an election commitment for a modest increase in TPIs, and I'd have to say that this is largely fulfilling the modest nature of that commitment. This bill will increase the rate of the disability compensation payment at the special rate, often referred to as the TPI or totally and permanently incapacitated payment, payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Because those payments are legislatively linked, the amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act provisions will also increase the temporary special rate under that act and the special rate disability pension payable under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is that increase going to be? Well, the increase that the government has committed to is a total payment of $1,000 over the year, which equates to $38.46 a fortnight, or, to really understand how modest this payment is, it equates to a bit less than $2.75 a day—not even a cup of coffee. That's the commitment that the government has brought to this chamber. We know that there are approximately 27,000 veterans who are struggling on the TPI payment. When you look at the entire TPI payment, plus all the very modest additional payments for energy supplements and the like, veterans who have been totally and permanently incapacitated because of injuries received during their service for the country are being asked to survive on less than $1,600 a fortnight, so less than $800 a week. With this payment, it will just touch $800 a week. For most veterans, given the cost of living in Australia, that is effectively a lifetime of poverty. That's what veterans get under the TPI: effectively a lifetime of poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee looked into this in 2021, they got submission after submission from veterans saying: 'Hang on! We served for the country. We put ourselves out to serve for the country, sometimes for decades, and we've been thrown on the scrap heap, with a TPI payment that barely keeps a roof above our heads, let alone keeps the power on or gives us access to the internet.' Although the quantum wasn't agreed, in 2021 the recommendation was that the government consider increasing the TPI payment. There wasn't agreement among the committee about how much that should be, but I'm pretty sure that, if we went back and looked at the submissions and read the evidence, and if we spoke to veterans, we could all agree in this chamber that $2.75 a day is not enough; that committing veterans to a lifetime of poverty is the wrong policy call from this government. I know that there are competing priorities for government expenditure, but this total package is probably $20 million or less this year—maybe a little bit more next year. We're talking tiny amounts of money in the government's budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see how veterans are valued in the priorities of this government and the priorities of the previous government. I want to make this clear: we're six months into this government, and at least we're getting an increase in the TPI. It's not much of an increase, it's embarrassingly small, but at least it's happening. So I'm going to give the minister and his office credit for achieving that. If you have a look at what happens to veterans on TPI, you'll see they are pretty much the only recipients of benefits that have gone backwards over the last seven years. They have fallen below the cost of living over the last seven years. They went backwards under the coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Often you see the coalition wanting to wrap themselves in khaki and say how much they care about the military and how much they love the defence forces. Let's have a look at what they delivered. They delivered to veterans falling real TPI benefits—less at the end of the coalition's term than they were at the beginning of the coalition's term. So let's have a look at all of those pictures of Dutton and others wrapped in khaki, standing beside the ADF—</span>

                    </a>  Let's have a look at the former coalition leadership team wrapped in khaki, sitting on tanks, hanging around with Defence Force personnel and saying how much they care about the military, and then let's look at what they provided for veterans: falling payments and endemic poverty.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At least we've got some movement from this government, and I'm going to give the minister and his office credit for that. But you couldn't have a better definition of 'modest' than $2.75 a day. That is like the Oxford dictionary definition of 'bugger all'. That's what this bill delivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry said, 'Increase the payment.' The problem, of course, is that the inquiry was in 2021. We've had more than a year of veterans struggling to get by on a payment that pretty much the entire committee recognised was inadequate in 2021, and now the increase is only $2.75 a day. And that's being generous—that's rounding it up, by the way. That's the increase they get from the government. I can understand why veterans are saying: 'What about us? When is our turn really going to come?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the federal government, under the coalition's watch, spend $4 billion not getting French submarines. In the military space, the ADF space, the former coalition government spent $4,000 million to not get French submarines, and then 27,000 veterans on TPI got nothing—not one red cent. I think that really shows the priorities of the former coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What veterans get under the new Albanese Labor government is nothing like $4 billion; it may be $20 million a year for the next four years. They get $2.75 a day. They know, because they've seen it, that the same Commonwealth government has dropped $4 billion not getting French submarines, and they say: 'Hang on. What are the priorities? Do we matter?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think that veterans should matter and we think that they should get a payment that is substantially more. I want to credit the veterans who have contacted my office and pointed out how they deserve better. In particular, communications with my office from the TPI Federation of Australia have shown us clearly how there has been that real decline in veterans' payments—over decades in fact. I will just quote from the correspondence that our office got: 'Recent increases of 30 per cent for petrol, 30 per cent for food, 38 per cent for insurance—house and car—will be greatly addressed by the two per cent this bill offers to TPIs. There are many TPIs who must now decide whether to buy their medication or food. If they choose their medication, they need to approach community food pantries to obtain their meagre food supplies.' That's what we're saying to veterans: choose food or medication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not going to fix that choice. I know that veterans wanted us to move amendments to double it—and we were close to moving amendments to double it, but we were advised by the government that, if we did that, it would basically kill the bill and veterans would get nothing. Veterans should get at least double, but the reason we're going to support this bill is so that they end this year knowing they're going to get a tiny, modest increase starting on 1 January. We want that to happen and we're not going to delay that. But let's commit collectively to coming back next year and start by doubling it, and then to having a really serious look at the level of payment that veterans deserve and need in order not to have that lifetime of poverty. They served the country, and it's about time that we returned that service with respect.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Shoebridge said, there are roughly 27,000 Australians on the TPI, and they have given their all. They have given their health as well as giving their service. They have always deserved better and they will always deserve better. The reasons for not moving that amendment are understandable. We saw a previous vote in this place—on seniors being able to double their allowance for work without penalty—go to the other place and come back and, to pass it, it had to be walked back on. So it's a good thing that this gets through now; it gives them something. But it is not enough. We saw under the last government a National Party minister effectively having to grandstand for $94 million to try to help veterans' processing. One thing this government has done is resource this quite well, to try to reduce the backlog. Senator Shoebridge and I were talking with DVA—with Liz Cosson AM, the secretary of that department—about the process. We were talking about backlogs and all those sorts of things, and about reducing to zero the overdue dates—there are massive, massive claims by veterans going back. We have to do more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why have these people not gotten what they deserve? It's because they're the quiet people. They served this country with pride, they're used to a chain of command and they don't want to be upset at what's going on so they effectively suffer in silence. It's a good thing this money is here. I note that the Tune report, which was referred to by Senator Shoebridge, put four options forward. Option 1 was no change to the TPI level and classification—it's great that wasn't taken up; that's gone. Option 2 was a one-off increase in the TPI payment, while maintaining non-economic-loss status. And there were other, bigger options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm small fry on our side—I'm not in government—but I heartily endorse Senator Shoebridge's contribution. When we come back, let's look at what we can give these people to go on. As Senator Davey said in her speech, every two weeks a veteran commits suicide. This is a cohort of people who worked together as a team, and they still have a great sense of loyalty to each other. They trusted their lives in other people's hands. Through their entire career, we picked them up and moved them on postings, and they did this without concern. They lost family, they lost their contacts and they lost friends—and they lost everything if they lost their health and qualified for a TPI pension. If we aren't giving them the basics to survive then we need to look at ourselves as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens when a person gets to the end? I have a constituent who has been contacting me over some time, and their situation is not a fault of the minister or the previous minister—it's because of the process. They are now at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on a claim that was initially approved and then taken back. When you talk to the people at DVA you see that they care, that they get it and that they want to do the right thing. This person has medical bills and they have had to hire someone at $100,000 a year to perform their role in their business. They are paying not only to get their health fixed but also for someone to do the job they could do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at this $2.75, which is what I think you calculated. Why is it important to the Nats so much? Because the military is overrepresented by people who come from the regions, just like it was in the call-up for the wars. People from the regions are overrepresented in the military. They are willing and happy to do their work. The analysis of the Tune report showed that TPI veterans within the broader TPI veteran cohort may have less financial security because of their individual circumstances, and that other changes to the TPI payment would be beneficial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look after these people who have finished their career, have bad health and, honestly, have no future career prospects. They have sacrificed so much and are left with very little. We need to give them hope, if nothing else. This $2.75, or $1,000, is something. I thank the government. We will be supporting this going forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In everything we do let's always think of these people. We celebrate so many people in this country, but not this cohort of people who get on, do the right thing, stay quiet and don't protest. We don't get clicktivism or noise from them. They're not out the front of Parliament House, but they are there and they are deserving of this. I wholly support this bill.</span>

As others in this chamber have mentioned today, this bill sees the government implement the election commitment to increase the TPI payment and responds to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report that recommended an increase in this payment. The TPI is paid to severely disabled veterans who are unable to work and support themselves because of permanent injuries that resulted, as other senators in this place have mentioned, from their selfless service for this country. It is financial support that we provide to severely incapacitated veterans. It's the minimum that we in this place should do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a modest increase. As my colleagues Senator Shoebridge and Senator Cadell referred to, it works out to be $2.75 a day. Veterans will get that increase in their pension. They have been struggling for a long time and are feeling cost-of-living pressures here in Australia, like everybody else right now. We will give them that modest increase of $2.75. I, on behalf of the Australian Greens—as Senator Shoebridge already said—congratulate the government, but it's not enough and we should be doing more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate office in Western Australia is contacted all of the time by Western Australian veterans, including some First Nations veterans as well. They call my office and they send me emails. They tell me in their emails and phone calls about their struggles with rising energy costs, expensive medical bills, lack of accessibility to mental health services and just having enough money, as Senator Shoebridge already said, so that they don't have to make a choice between medication and food. This is their story—feeding their families, paying their rent, getting from A to B, and putting petrol in the tank.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, during my time in WA Police, I heard stories from ex ADF personnel who had joined the local police force—and I worked beside them—about the compounding trauma that they experienced during their time serving this country and the compounding trauma that stays with them still. I also watch and observe the Soldiers &amp; Sirens Facebook page and others where I still see stories. I see the lack of accessibility to the front-line support that we provide to our veterans.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country our veterans have been reaching out to politicians for years and talking about the suffering that has happened to them and their mates, about how nothing ever changes and no-one ever listens and about how this culture of turning a blind eye results in poorer mental health outcomes. As Senator Davey mentioned, it results, unfortunately, in suicides.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides that modest additional financial support in TPI for veterans and their families who already receive this payment and for other eligible veterans in the future. The increase to this payment means it will be comparable with the national minimum wage and more than the after-tax national minimum wage a wage earner would receive. Do the Greens support this? Yes, we do. Do the Greens think it's enough? No, we don't. I'd like to see the representatives in this place who have no military experience live off a modest pension such as this and make some of those choices that our veterans are making today. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sacrifices these veterans have made for us during their Defence Force service are worth more than the minimum wage in this country. These veterans and their families live with their sacrifices every single day. We can do more in this place. We can start by sharing the dark stories of war—sad and horrifying realities that veterans have faced in battles on foreign shores—the truth-telling about the torment of these experiences that veterans live with every single day. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My people are also part of this story. They served in wars for this country and were denied some of the fundamental human rights and basic decency and respect, in relation to their identity. They served in the Boer War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War all before they were recognised as citizens in this country. Let's not forget that their lives were also lost in the frontier wars that raged across this country. That's not the definition of 'veteran', unfortunately, so we barely acknowledge that. I have spoken directly to Assistant Minister Keogh, in the other place, and I want to congratulate him for some of his recent commitments, in relation to his work on this bill, in making sure that the wrongs of the past are righted. But we have a long way to go. We have a lot of work to do. </span>

We are not going to forget that you deserve the recognition and the support that we as politicians have the power to provide through change. We must show our current service men and women that we can do better when it comes to veterans' issues, and we must give them the platform for their voices to be heard.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade and Tourism, Special Minister of State and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  The Australian community has a clear expectation that defence personnel and veterans and their families are well looked after. This is an important task and responsibility of government, and a solemn commitment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summing up the debate on this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2022, I thank the opposition and all of the others in this place for their support of it. This legislation demonstrates the Albanese Labor government's commitment to delivering a better future for our veterans and their families. It addresses the adequacy of support for totally and permanently incapacitated veterans—often referred to as TPI veterans—and their families and it provides them greater financial support to ultimately deliver a better future for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In April the federal Labor team announced that the Labor government, if elected, would act on the recommendation of the Senate inquiry to increase the TPI payment by $1,000 a year. This bill today implements Labor's commitment by increasing the special rate of disability compensation payments for veterans. We're very glad that today we are receiving the support of senators to ensure that the TPI veterans are better off. This $1,000 a year increase to the special rate of disability pension, an increase of $38.46 per fortnight, is to ensure veterans and their families are better supported financially, helping them keep up with cost-of-living pressures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It forms part of the recent federal budget, which is delivering on the Albanese Labor government's commitment to deliver responsible cost-of-living relief. The increase to the TPI payment means it will be comparable to the national minimum wage and, crucially, greater than the after-tax national minimum wage a wage earner would receive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This initiative recognises the importance of supporting veterans who have been severely impacted by their experiences in the Australian Defence Force. The bill will achieve this by amending the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to increase the rate of pension payable to TPI veterans. This government is committed to implementing practical support measures to better support defence personnel, veterans and their families. We are committed to ensuring that they get the support that they not only need but, more particularly, deserve. I commend the bill to the Senate. </span>

I state at the outset that the coalition strongly supports the government's commitment to expand the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. The amendments to the bill are an additional incentive for recruitment in expanding the ADF and meeting existing recruitment targets. As we know and would expect, initiatives like this can directly contribute to retaining skills and talent within the ADF, which is, as everyone would agree, critical in the current geopolitical climate. The coalition supports measures that will reduce the cost of living for currently serving and former ADF members. One other benefit is the fact that measures like this can improve the health and wellbeing of ADF members, both past and present. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the details of the bill and what it will do, the bill will amend the eligibility criteria for the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme, which will improve access to homeownership for Australian Defence Force members earlier in their defence careers and allow veterans to access the scheme any time after completion. In particular, it will reduce the qualifying service period for initial access to the DHOAS and minimum service periods for each subsidy tier so that eligible members and veterans are entitled to receive higher levels of subsidy payments sooner. It will also remove the existing five-year post-separation time frame to access the scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also make other minor amendments to the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Act 2008: firstly, to create a power for the Secretary of Defence to declare that a subsidy-ceasing event did not occur if they are satisfied that all outstanding amounts due under a subsidised loan were not paid due to a genuine error, a mistake or an accident; and, secondly, to insert a recoverable payments mechanisms to address the risk of breaches of section 83 of the Constitution arising from payments purportedly made under the act in good faith in the bona fide administration of the act but not supported by the act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the scheme, its background and history, the scheme was established in 2008 and provides eligible ADF members and veterans with a monthly subsidy payment on the interest portion of their mortgage payments for those who choose to purchase a home of their own to live in. The assistance is provided in response to the additional difficulties that ADF members, veterans and their families have in purchasing a home as a result of military service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">DHOAS sits within the portfolio responsibilities of the Department of Defence but is actually administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs on behalf of the Department of Defence. The Department of Veterans' Affairs was consulted extensively on the development of this bill, based on information provided by the government. It's a retention initiative aimed at encouraging members to continue serving in the ADF. The scheme provides, as I stated, an incentive for members to stay in the ADF. The longer you serve, the more entitlement you accrue and the longer you can receive assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be able to access DHOAS, you need to have served in the ADF within the last five years, completed a qualifying period of service and accrued a service credit. For permanent members, the qualifying period is four consecutive years of service. For reservists, however, it is eight consecutive years of effective reserve service of at least 20 paid days per financial year. For all members, if there is a break in service, there needs to be a commencement once again. Continuous full-time service can fast-track reservists' qualifying periods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The assistance provided by the scheme is not tied to a home loan with a specific value. Eligible banks are the Australian Military Bank, Defence Bank and the NAB. Changes to the act that administers the scheme came into effect from 22 June 2020. The amendments extended the time frame for ADF members leaving the ADF to access their final scheme subsidy certificate from two to five years. Those changes also ensure that members who leave the ADF and rejoin within five years will retain all service credit accrued prior to their break in service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already stated that the coalition strongly supports the government's commitment to expand this scheme, the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. The coalition believe that, if young Australians are prepared to defend Australia, we should help them buy and establish a home. The amendments in this bill are an additional incentive for recruitment in expanding the ADF and meeting existing recruitment targets. Initiatives like this can directly contribute to retaining skills and talent within the ADF. Defence annual reports mention the conduct of surveys that identify DHOAS as a key factor in ADF retention, which is why these changes in this legislation from the government are so vitally important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, of course—as you would expect of all parliamentarians in this place—supports measures that will reduce the cost of living for current serving and former ADF members. Measures like this, as I have already said, have an impact on the health and wellbeing of past and present ADF members. The ADF is currently facing significant challenges to recruit and retain its numbers and is, therefore, struggling to grow its workforce. So this bill, it's hoped, will improve the ADF's ability to recruit and retain. Housing and homeownership are critical factors that influence the health and welfare of ADF members and veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in terms of some areas that were of concern to the coalition, there was at least perceived to be considerable risk that amendments in this bill may not achieve the intended outcomes being proposed. There's no statistical data that supports some of the presuppositions about the changes, but we will be watching quite closely the rollout of this scheme and the impact that it has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to increased separation rates, reducing the minimum service period for eligibility may well or could impact negatively on retention, with members separating once they reach the minimum eligibility criteria. The current minimum period of service for eligibility aligns with the initial minimum period of service and members' return-of-service obligations following their fully funded courses for recruitment, training and university education. Again, that's another matter we will be watching quite closely through the estimates process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of financial risk, there's a growing exponential cost associated with funding these amendments that runs into the forward estimates given the growth rate expected from amending and reducing the eligibility criteria. We have also expressed concern around the limited number of providers. It would be great to see that broadened. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in broad terms, I think it's quite clear that this is a good piece of legislation. The coalition absolutely supports any measure that helps our Defence Force, its serving members past and present, to continue to make the contribution that they do with these added incentives and a degree of peace of mind around homeownership and the costs associated with it, particularly at a time when we are seeing mortgage interest rates increase to the extent they are. This will be welcome relief to current and past members of our ADF. On that basis, I've stated the coalition's position and I commend the bill.</span>

The bill demonstrates the commitment the Albanese Labor government made to boost homeownership for Defence members and veterans and to assist veterans transitioning from military to civilian life. As part of the government's election commitment, the bill will amend the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme and expand access to it by providing defence members with access to benefits earlier in their careers. The qualifying period will be reduced to two years for serving members and to four years for reservists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also allow veterans to apply for their final subsidy certificate at any time after they have separated from the Australian Defence Force by removing the current five-year limitation. This will ensure veterans can access the scheme at a time that suits them, without feeling pressured to do so in a set period. These amendments will mean better outcomes for defence members, veterans and their families, and will reinforce the government's commitment to retention in the Australian Defence Force, to homeownership for members and veterans, and to the wellbeing of members and veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also help our defence personnel and veterans with the cost-of-living pressures that all Australians are feeling with regard to housing, which are making it increasingly difficult to achieve the great Australian dream of homeownership. Labor created the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme, and now the Albanese Labor government is expanding it. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281697" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  As with so many policy issues that we have seen since the change of government, regional and rural Australians are once again the forgotten people in this legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. They've been thrown to the kerb. While the virtue signallers on the other side of the chamber clamber to make expensive cars cheaper so they can demonstrate their climate credentials, we have hundreds—possibly more—of families in rural areas at the present time with no car, no truck and no means of transport, and their roads are being absolutely shredded to pieces. Even when these floods go, buying any car will be a challenge for these people, who will have to face the clean-up costs and the repair bills in their struggle to get back to some semblance of normal life. How do you think those families in our flood effected areas, who are trying to save their homes and furniture, are going to feel when they hear the Albanese government is pushing hard to get legislation through, doing secret deals with the Greens to get legislation through, that gives people who can probably already afford it access to a discounted imported electric car? How do you think our local governments in those areas are going to feel when they realise the Albanese government is pushing hard to legislate to get more vehicles on our roads that contribute nothing to road maintenance, because electric vehicles don't pay the fuel excise?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a tax relief for electric vehicles which will undermine our general revenue. How are we going to repair our roads when the whole of Australia is driving around in electric vehicles, even though we don't have the infrastructure to support them yet? Once again, this is a government that has no idea what happens in the engine room of Australia, and, as its budget has demonstrated over and over again, it has no interest in supporting the regions, which are the engine room of our economy. It's just another example of disregard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the city dweller, electric cars are an easy way to get to the shops. If the car battery is running low, you can just plug it in. There are numerous recharging stations very close by. Or, as we've seen in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> and other news, you just run an extension cord out your window to the kerb. Of course, the irony is that, especially here in the ACT—and I know Senator David Pocock is very passionate about this bill as well—the ACT government boast that they are 100 per cent renewable powered when the reality is that overnight, when the lights go out, they connect back to the grid, and all those people plugging their cars in overnight are actually plugging into coal-fired power. But we won't let detail get in the way of good virtue signalling!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our regional communities, however, there aren't endless recharging stations and a trip to the local shop isn't just a kilometre away; it's often many kilometres. If I want to get a bottle of milk, I've got a 36-kilometre one-way trip from my house, and there are no charging stations nearby. There will, hopefully, one day, be such infrastructure in regional Australia, but it's not today. So this discount car-buying opportunity is of zero use to regional Australians. Not now, not yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before those opposite start to accuse me and others on this side of not supporting net zero strategies or of being climate Luddites, let me remind you of the coalition's Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy. That plan recognised that progress must take all Australians along with it. All Australians need to be on the journey to net zero, not just the inner-city dwellers. It must be embraced in step with advances in technology to underpin the changes. There must be investment in the infrastructure across the nation to keep up with those advances. Our plan was well researched and well consulted and was intended to bring long-term benefits to all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategy detailed a technology-led approach to reducing transport emissions while ensuring Australians could drive their preferred type of vehicle, be it petrol, diesel, hydrogen, hybrid—which are now being demonised—or electric powered. The principles that underpinned our policy were to partner with the private sector to support uptake and stimulate co-investment into future fuels, focusing on reducing barriers to the rollout of future fuel technologies. That also was a focus on where infrastructure investment needed to be and expanding consumer choice by enabling informed choice and minimising costs of integration into the grid.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip in the </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Not much else in this world is more chilling to hear than a cancer diagnosis. Cancer can feel like, and may well be, a death sentence. It can mean that the creature comforts of everyday life are ripped away instantly. That's despite the incredible advancements in modern medicine and treatment options ensuring that more and more people are survivors. However, the reality is that most people who receive a cancer diagnosis spend a lot of time in clinical settings, such as hospitals, surgeries and emergency departments. Remember the last time you were in one of those settings, with the white walls and the incessant beeping of medical equipment? They may be necessary for medical treatment but are not conducive to rest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The comforts of home can help relieve the stresses of treatment following a cancer diagnosis, and it's the comfort of home that Cancer Council Tasmania replicates at its Northern Cancer Support Centre, the first of its kind in Australia, which this year celebrates 10 years of operation. This is a remarkable milestone that deserves recognition, as do the many hundreds of volunteers who have been volunteering throughout that time. The centre provides around 1,500 sessions of support to its clients every year and was designed to be a homely space. It brings the comforts of home into a non-judgemental space, where clients and their families can rest and take stock of what they are enduring and what is to come next.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Cancer Support Centre offers a range of evidence based resources and also provides access to a wig library for those who are struggling emotionally with the loss of their hair during treatment. There are many reasons why the Northern Cancer Support Centre should be celebrated, but the most important reason is this: if you live in Northern Tasmania and are going through your own cancer journey, you are always welcome at this Launceston based centre. It's more than a building; it's a community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 is designed to ensure that people in female dominated professions, like health care, aged care, disability support and the early childhood education sector, get the pay rise and support that they so desperately deserve. But it's these changes that those opposite in question time yesterday deemed radical and, in the other place, referred to as 'extreme'. It's very important for us to understand what is in this bill and how it will improve gender equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite call these changes radical, including gender equality and job security as objects of the act—and I don't see anything extreme or radical about that—and also limiting the use of fixed-term contracts to give genuine fixed-term arrangements. Again, I don't see how this is incredibly radical but that is the proposition being put by those opposite. This bill introduces a statutory equal remuneration principle. That's right: equal pay to close the gender pay gap. How crazy and extreme!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes prohibiting pay secrecy clauses—something that we know has contributed to the gender pay gap for many, many years. The bill includes providing stronger access to flexible working arrangements, desperately needed by women returning to work. And the bill makes sure that we're providing stronger protections against workplace discrimination for the protected attributes of gender identity, intersex status and breastfeeding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also does this very important thing, which those opposite don't want to talk about. It implements recommendation 28 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report—a report they let sit on a table—to prohibit sexual harassment at work. Well, if this is radical and extreme, it's for those on the opposite side to explain why.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I'm delighted to have been asked to read out the speeches of several intelligent, passionate and articulate young people from Queensland as part of the Raise Our Voice in parliament campaign. Today I'm reading out a speech from Ella Sheahan. Ella says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Hi, my name is Ella Sheahan. I'm 15 years old and a year 10 student at Earnshaw State College in the Lilley electorate in Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Put yourself in the shoes, or rather the feathers, of a migratory shorebird where you've just battled gale force winds and rain flying 12,000 gruelling kilometres in search of a safe resting place and habitat only to return and find something horrific—a townhouse development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is the sad reality for many critically endangered birds, and we are watching the mass extinction unfold right in front of us, just one site being the much loved Toondah Harbour wetlands in Cleveland.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Why are we letting this happen to our ancient rainforest, bush and wetlands? Please answer the calls and crows of our wildlife and future generations. Australia's ecosystems are disappearing from the face of our Earth. Why don't we pull the parachute? There is no safety net below. In the time it has taken for me to read this speech alone, 50 football fields worth of precious forests have been flattened—destroyed; 20 hectares of uniquely biodiverse ecosystems—destroyed; 17,000 tons of carbon stores—destroyed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We need to get to the root of the problem. You have all the power. You can be the Lorax who speaks for the trees and my generation. You can stop us all from toppling over the edge. It will take time, but together we can use our intellect to resurrect and redirect our future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate a national disgrace in how our young people in Western Australia are being treated. Imagine if you were a parent of a 12-year-old boy and you saw footage of your son being sat on by three custodial officers with another five watching on. He is silently screaming because he is struggling to breathe. This is not 200 years ago; this was last month in Western Australia. This barbaric practice, called folding up, is a restraint position that is banned, I understand, by law enforcement globally because it risks suffocation and death. Unbelievably, it has been revealed through footage that the McGowan Labor government in Western Australia is allowing this practice and so many other inappropriate and, quite frankly, barbaric practices to occur on children in our detention system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is almost as shocking as the revelation of this practice is the cold and callous response of our Premier, saying the system was actually 'working well'. There is no doubt that these children are incredibly challenging to manage, but it is not only barbaric but counterproductive to treat any child in this way. It is no way to treat them, and it is certainly no way to rehabilitate them. Even former Labor Premier Carmen Lawrence has said that Mark McGowan's response was 'tone deaf' and it was 'insubstantial'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another way. There are far more humane and far more effective ways to manage these destructive behaviours through behaviour support. These practices, done well, largely eliminate the need for physical and chemical restraint practices. They are humane and they work, and we must treat our children differently in Western Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmani</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">a</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  I was pleased to meet this week with the Ambassador of Ukraine to Australia, His Excellency Vasyl Myroshnychenko, to receive an update about the situation in Ukraine. As chair and former deputy chair of the Ukraine-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group, I've had many contacts with the ambassador since his appointment. I will just say that my husband has family in Ukraine so the situation with the war in Ukraine is particularly personal to me. The recent liberation of Kherson, as reported in the media, is a major setback for Russia's illegal efforts to invade and occupy Ukraine. While Ukraine has now recaptured around 50 per cent of the territory previously held by Russia, Kherson is of particular strategic importance as a Black Sea port and the gateway to Crimea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that Australia has contributed to this effort. On 27 October, Prime Minister Albanese announced that, in addition to the support Australia has already provided, we will send 70 ADF personnel to the United Kingdom as part of the UK's efforts to train Ukraine's armed forces. Australia has also committed a further 30 Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles to Ukraine, bringing the total number of gifted Bushmasters to 90. In financial terms, this brings Australia's total assistance to $655 million, including $475 million in military assistance. Since the invasion began we have been the largest non-NATO contributor to Ukraine. Our contribution to Ukraine's self-defence is vital to upholding the global rules based order. It sends a strong signal that we will not tolerate the invasion of a democratic sovereign nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The combination of targeted sanctions against Russia and Belarus, global military assistance to Ukraine and the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people have all been key to making Russia's invasion a monumental failure.</span>

This is the food being fed to our elderly and vulnerable in aged-care facilities—to our parents and grandparents. There's no way they're getting the nutritional value they need from those meals. The royal commission into aged care said that up to 50 per cent of residents were suffering malnutrition. For our elderly population, malnutrition can lead to more falls and a higher risk of infections and disease. To put it in a nutshell: for some people, malnutrition can be a death sentence. Since the royal commission, a lot of residential facilities have upped their game; they're preparing better meals. But a lot of them aren't. There are still residents being fed on less than $10 a day. Aged-care homes were given extra money to fix this. Some of them pocketed it and kept on feeding the residents sludge. That's not good enough. It's time to have someone who is independent take a look at this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We could send a dietician in to look at what food the home is feeding to people. The dietician would make sure residents are getting all the nutrients and good stuff that they need from the meals. A dietician could also assess residents at least once a year for malnutrition—just like a check-up from the doctor. They would make sure that the residents were healthy and, if they weren't healthy, they could refer them to someone to get help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've made a lot of progress in aged care since the royal commission, but we still have a long way to go. The residents of these homes have worked hard all their lives, just to end up in a facility that doesn't even feed them properly. I hope that, if I'm in a home one day, I'm in a facility that will give me the decency and the respect to feed me a proper meal.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">What is democracy without integrity? Integrity is the core foundation of trust between the elected and the electors. A lack of integrity erodes the trust in our democratic institutions, and in the very principles our great nation was founded upon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Public trust in our government is at an all-time low and falling. 85% of Australians believe federal politics is plagued with corruption (The Australia Institute). Whether or not this is the case, this level of public distrust is a critical issue which directly threatens our democracy and which must be resolved.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We're fortunate enough that the vast majority of our public servants are sincere and hard-working politicians, who have dedicated their lives to serving this country.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Today I will be sharing a speech written by 15-year-old Angelina as part of the Raise Our Voice in parliament campaign, a campaign that gives young female and non-binary people from all backgrounds the opportunity to have their stories heard on the national stage. Angelina wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many of you in this room are connected to a young person in your life. Whether it would be a niece or nephew, son or daughter, or perhaps grandson or granddaughter, if you're lucky. Regardless, we were all once narrow visioned in this fathomless world. In other words, we were all young.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am forever grateful that our politicians have believed that our youth could grant insight on what we should achieve as our nation's future leaders. With that said, there is an ongoing issue plaguing our younger demographic, the growth in incarceration rates and criminal behaviour. Like the faith you've had for me and millions of other youngsters, I implore you to also share this with incarcerated youth. By throwing them into prisons, we push further the untrue narrative that they can never improve. Especially at the ages where the brain is still in development, we must take the initiative to correct this behaviour, before it merges with their temperament. We must not punish them and abandon what may fester into resentment. Instead, with a positive attitude, we must reinforce proper behaviour and build rapport with them. This approach will reduce the current rate of recidivism of 54 per cent within 12 months. Just as we would not disown our child for misbehaving, our nation must not leave behind any person who is a part of our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks so much, Angelina.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer to war is not more war. The answer to escalating militarism is not nuclear bombers stationed here. The stationing of B52 nuclear-capable bombers in the Northern Territory is a dangerous escalation and it must be opposed. No-one needs nuclear-capable bombers, least of all this country. It makes Australia an even bigger part of the global nuclear weapons threat to all of humanity—our very existence. They should have no place, no safe harbour in our country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  During the pandemic, many of us had an opportunity to explore our own backyards, get out bush or go up the coast. Some people may or may not know just how many of our tourism businesses are owned and operated by First Nations people. It is a relatively small part of the Australian tourism sector, but a vitally important part for our mob.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Employment for First Nations people in the tourism sector provides an opportunity for mob to stay on country and earn an income by maintaining and sharing their culture and traditions. First Nations cultural tourism can provide an important source of income, particularly in regional and remote areas where other job opportunities are limited. It has been found that the number of international tourists taking part in First Nations cultural tourism activities is increasing, which is welcomed. Often, there's a joke that Australia has no culture, but as First Nations people, we do. We have a very rich cultural heritage that spans across the whole country, with art, song, dance, stories, scientific knowledge, food, traditions and law. In most cases, First Nations communities welcome the chance to share this incredible knowledge, as it has been passed down for thousands of years. We are the oldest continuing culture in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the tourism sector recovers from COVID lockdowns and border closures, First Nations tourism ventures need to be given support as Australia markets itself as a place to travel to. The government must genuinely include and promote First Nations owned and operated tourism ventures. Further, I urge travellers to ensure that, when they go out bush, to the coast or anywhere in this country, they know whose land they are actually on, and make sure that they make an effort to learn about the community's unique culture and stories. Support First Nations local businesses and participate in First Nations cultural tourism activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the environment report</span> said that poorly managed tourism was one of the factors putting cultural heritage at risk. We need to do better and protect our precious places, sacred sites and unique landscapes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I rise to speak in relation to the government's proposed industrial relations bill, which I think represents a great threat to businesses—small and medium-sized businesses in particular—in my home state of Queensland. Yesterday there were questions asked in this place about how, in the regulatory impact statement, the government came to the view that small and medium-sized businesses would be able to get a consultant to help them through this industrial relations maze at $175 an hour. The government has produced this regulatory impact statement in terms of the impact of this bill on small businesses and medium-sized businesses. It has assumed that, for $175 an hour, you can get a consultant to help you go through this maze that you've been compelled to go through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Numerous sources were quoted, but I did something obvious. I actually rang a small business that provides these services. How astounding! I actually rang someone who provides these services. Do you know what they told me their services cost? A junior associate costs $350 an hour—twice as much as the assumption contained in the government's regulatory impact statement. $350 an hour. Multiply the cost on small and medium-sized businesses by a factor of two. If you want to get someone more senior—if you're up against a Senator Tony Sheldon in his previous life, a Senator Tim Ayres in his previous life or a Senator Raff Ciccone in his previous life—you're looking at between $400 and $500 an hour. This bill needs scrutiny. It needs more time. This Senate needs time to do its job. I call upon the government to get this legislation right.</span>

He's done a lot of work exposing the Left's infestation of the West's education systems, as well as defending free speech and championing open and honest dialogue about difficult subjects. It was wonderful to hear someone other than me—I feel like I just talk to blank walls all the time in this place—trying to get the message across about ordinary people out there.

They are hanging on by their fingernails and dropping off the edge because the main thing is that they cannot afford cheap energy. Cheap energy drives everything. Yet we have governments that have constantly put in place systems that are driving up the cost of power and causing the loss of jobs. That's the main factor. You're worrying about saving the planet at the expense of people living in poverty and not being able to have a decent life. The whole fact is that 20 million people a year die due to the air that they breathe in. These people living in poverty without electricity are actually dying because of the dung they burn in their fires. You're not dealing with that, because you couldn't care less about it. You're all worried about saving the planet.</span>

Do you know what it's all about? People need to start growing up. They need to start taking responsibility for their own actions, make decisions and not be led by those who will fill their heads with garbage and rubbish. That is happening in our education system with the indoctrination of children, which I spoke about and covered in my bill. Get out of telling people how to live their lives. People need to grow up, get a backbone and stand up for themselves.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  On Wednesday last week Deliveroo abruptly shut down its Australian operations, leaving around 15,000 riders out of work, with no warning. For the thousands of riders who had relied on Deliveroo for income there was little consolation in the company's announcement that it would compensate them with two weeks pay but not actually deliver the payment for at least a month. There's also no guarantee that riders will receive what they were already owed, as their claims are ranked low in the hierarchy of the company's administration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deliveroo's complete abandonment of its workforce is symptomatic of a deeper problem with the gig economy. Gig workers are treated as individual business entities and, as a result, are denied all the basic pay and conditions which Australian workers have fought for generations to achieve. The evasion of employment obligations underpins the business model of many gig platforms, not just Deliveroo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently I have an intern in my office from ANU, Kesh Karupiah, who has written a wonderful research report about the gig economy and the regulation that Australia desperately needs. His research report highlights the sheer scale of the problem. In 2020 Australia's gig workforce was estimated to be as large as 250,000 workers, outnumbering the workforce in industries like media and communications and mining. On top of that, the gig workforce is overrepresented with young people, migrants and disabled people. Research tells us that these are groups with particularly limited knowledge about their rights and how to defend them, making them very vulnerable to the predatory and ruthless practices of gig platforms. It is essential that gig workers receive the same minimum pay and conditions as other employees. All kinds of workers should be on an equal footing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We look forward to Labor introducing industrial relations legislation to plug this significant regulatory gap that's currently working to entrench an already vulnerable workforce.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  In March this year the former government announced that the Australian Defence Force would be grown by 18,500 uniformed personnel by 2040. This investment is an important step in increasing our country's security, particularly considering the changing situation in the Indo-Pacific region and in eastern Europe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This growth, however, cannot occur without retaining the people that we currently have. With separation rates climbing, we are approaching a retention crisis in our defence force. Defence workers are expected to carry gaps in staffing, becoming overworked and leading to burnout, frustration and disillusionment in the work being done. Even the smallest of improvements can change a workplace. The Chief of Air Force recently announced that men would now be able to grow a beard—something that I've done recently. The collective joy of Air Force personnel was palpable, as was the collective envy of the Army. The ADF Employment Offer Modernisation Program is offering extra incentives and flexibility to entice defence members to extend their service. Retention is a complex issue so it would be so important to listen to those with the boots on the ground, to iron out the frustrations that some feel, and to continue to make our defence personnel feel valued. We need to invest in the people that we have as a first step in growing our defence force to ensure the future safety of our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I acknowledge the assistance in the preparation of these remarks by Sergeant Jennifer Singleton of the Royal Australian Army. It has been my privilege to have her in my office this week as part of the ADF exchange program. Sergeant Singleton is attached to the Headquarters of the Special Operations Command, based here in Canberra. I thank Sergeant Singleton.</span>

Well, another day, and we have the opposition continuing to clutch at straws to find any reason possible to stop workers in this country from getting a pay rise. They will do anything to stop talking about workers getting a pay rise. They will do anything to stop small businesses and medium-sized businesses being able to participate in a system that exists under their current legislation to deliver pay rises for their workers, a more simple industrial relations system and higher productivity for small businesses.</span>

                  </a>  As I say, this is a continuation of what we saw yesterday from the opposition, trying to find any possible reason, whether it be websites or people—consultants. What this is actually about is one of the false claims that the opposition have been making this week, which is their claim that it will cost small businesses $14,000 to participate in multi-employer bargaining, and medium-sized employers will pay even more. Now, you'll be surprised to hear that that's actually wrong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way the laws are structured allows for small businesses to have access to the cooperative workplaces stream, so that, if a small business wants to go and engage a consultant, whoever that might be, to assist them, then that's a matter for them. But what I think you will find is that most small businesses are members of chambers of commerce and are members of industry associations, who would actually go and do the negotiations on their behalf. And then a small business would have the option of choosing to be part of that or not. Of course, if their workers would like to be part of that, then the majority of those workers have to go through a process to support that option. They also have to go to the Fair Work Commission to get approval to do so. So this idea—</span>

Is the minister going to ask his department to fix the regulatory impact statement, or does the minister stand by the calculation of the modern-day spiritual healer he references in his report?</span>

Tomorrow is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which is an important day for us to acknowledge one of the widespread human rights abuses that exist worldwide. This day also commences the 16 days of activism. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mark this day as part of a global call to action to end violence against women. Worldwide, one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence, mostly by an intimate partner. This is even higher when including sexual harassment. This statistic is mirrored by the Australian experience, where one in three women have experienced violence by an intimate partner, one woman dies every 10 days in Australia at the hands of her former or current partner, and one in two women in Australia have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime. First Nations women are 11 times more likely to be killed due to experiencing family violence than non-Indigenous women and are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of this violence. We know that this violence is compounded for women from some backgrounds who also experience other forms of discrimination, like ableism, homophobia and racism. It doesn't just have a human cost. It also costs the economy, at $26 billion a year, half of which is borne by the victims themselves. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This violence against women and children is not inevitable, and we can and must take action to end it. It's why we're working with states and territories on a collective goal—to end violence against women and children in a generation—through the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-2032 that was released on 17 October this year and agreed by the Commonwealth states and territories. Together we can take action to achieve an Australia and a world where all women and girls live free from fear and violence. </span>

That was a policy designed and advocated for by my colleague Senator McAllister in the previous term of parliament. </span>

It's a joint initiative. The national plan also highlights that everyone must play a role in ending this violence, across government, communities, workplaces, sporting organisations, business and the media. If we all pull in the same direction and pull together, change is possible.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:15</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. The tourism industry directly employed over 666,000 Australians in the June quarter of this year, many of them being small-business operators. Under Labor's extreme IR changes, could a cafe on the Mornington Peninsula employing 20 staff be compelled into multi-employer bargaining alongside a large hotel on the Mornington Peninsula due to them being in the same industry and the same geographical location?</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. The point of order goes to whether the question is in order given where the bill is. I have not intervened to date because I understand that the policy and politics of the issue is in the matter that the Senate has historically questioned and continues to question, even when legislation is before the Senate, notwithstanding the standing orders. I may have misheard Senator Henderson, but I thought she directly went to the legislation, in which case I would assert it is out of order in the current terms. But the way I would deal with it—because I understand the issue, Senator Birmingham—is that, if that is the case, I would invite her to rephrase.</span>

                  </a>  President, just before you rule on the point of order, I do note that, on Tuesday of this week, the government themselves asked a question related to this legislation. I further note that you and previous Presidents have ruled broadly in relation to these questions about anticipation of Senate business, and I would encourage you to uphold your ruling and previous rulings about that breadth of questioning that is available to senators.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take some advice, Senator Birmingham, because I thought the question was not confined to Senator Farrell's area, but I'll take advice. In relation to the point of order, I'm advised that, if the question went generally to policy issues, then it would be reasonable to ask Senator Farrell to answer it. But the question, in my view, did go to details, because it sought a comparison under an aspect of the proposed bill that related one type of business to another type of business. I can invite Senator Farrell to answer the broad policy nature of that question.</span>

If it were, it would block questions on a wide variety of subjects. Indeed, none other than former senator John Faulkner argued previously about the broad interpretation taken in relation to this. The senator's question relates to policies and reforms of the government. She's asking about those policies, reforms and changes. She has not referenced specific legislation either in her first go at the question or in her rewording of the question.</span>

We know from what the former Leader of the Government in the Senate said that low wages were a design feature of the Liberal Party's policy.

                  </a>  Senator Wong, thank you. In recent weeks, Australians were shocked and bloody angry when news broke that the soft-plastics recovery scheme run by REDcycle had collapsed, with billions of tons of plastic packaging being stored in warehouses rather than being recycled. Australians who were doing the right thing and taking plastic packaging back to supermarkets where it was purchased, rightly had expectations that big business and government would live up to their end of the bargain and see these plastics, which are so commonly found and dangerous in our oceans, recycled. Minister Plibersek expressed frustration at the news, saying, 'It shouldn't be beyond big companies like Coles and Woolworths to come up with a viable solution to soft-plastic recycling.' Senator, why is it seemingly beyond these big businesses to sort out their mess, and what is your government now planning to do to hold them to account?</span>

I know that, in our household and in many households, people who have done the right thing, put soft plastics together in a big bag and taken them down to the local supermarket in the hope of actually reducing the amount of soft plastic in the environment were very, very disappointed by the news of the financial position the industry was in but also the lack of results.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked the question: why is it beyond big business? Well, I guess you'd have to ask them. What I can say is that it's clear the regulatory settings that were in place and the incentives that were in place, whether they were government or market driven, were insufficient for that sector to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there is not just environmental but economic benefit in recycling, as opposed to it going to landfill. Knowing Ms Plibersek as I do and knowing her determination as the Minister for the Environment and Water to take action on this, I have no doubt she will look very carefully at what the best way forward is. This is an issue where I would say to the industry that Australians are clear in terms of their behaviours—what they want to do—and it would be a good thing if the market could respond to that incentive, which is that people want to do the right thing.</span>

What I understand is that we're a long way from meeting them. The note I have in front of me—and I'll confirm this—is that the target of 70 per cent of plastic packaging was set for 2025, and Australia has been stuck at 16 per cent for four years. I don't know if that's going to be worsened by the subsequent industry collapse, or challenges, that you've described. Clearly, nine years of a coalition government who didn't want to do anything on this has meant we're a long way behind.</span>

The minister has added plastics from medical waste, mattresses and tyres to the minister's priority list. Listing these products is a signal to industry to act, and, if not, then obviously government can.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that far too many Australians are struggling to buy a home, and that Australians living in regional areas have faced some of the largest drops in housing affordability, making it increasingly hard for locals to save a sufficient deposit. After almost a decade of inaction, the Albanese government is finally showing national leadership to help get more regional Australians into their first home. The Albanese government acted to deliver on our commitment to establish the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee by October, three months earlier than promised. Ten thousand places will be available each financial year through the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee to support regional first home buyers to purchase new or existing homes with a deposit of as little as five per cent.</span>

The regional guarantee is part of the Albanese government's ambitious housing reform agenda to support people into homeownership and to improve the supply and the quality of social and affordable housing.</span>

The urgent care clinics are a new model of care which we committed to in the election, and Senator Tyrrell is correct to say that there were three committed to in locations in Tasmania as part of that campaign. The commitments were in Burnie, Launceston and Hobart. I understand the Premier of Tasmania has requested that the Burnie clinic be in Devonport or the Latrobe region, which was agreed to as well. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very short answer to your question is: yes, they will be delivered. We are working with states and territories on finalising the model, and we'll go through that work, but the money was provided in the budget to deliver on the commitment we made, which was 50 urgent care clinics. Subsequent to making that commitment, New South Wales and Victoria have supplemented and provided funding, I think in the order of $100 million, for clinics in their states, and so we've added in some money on top of the original commitment to work with them to get the model right.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an exciting model. I know that here in the ACT it's a different model, but we had nurse-led walk-in centres which provided a bit of the gap between emergency departments and out-of-hours care, particularly for those not needing to head to the hospital. They've been very popular with the local community here, and we think that model can be built upon, but obviously with general practice as key participants.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will deliver it. We're working with states and territories to refine the model and of course working with general practice across the country to make sure it aligns with their priorities as well.</span>

You're right, urgent care clinics on their own are not going to solve some of the issues, because of the issues in remote and rural parts of the country. That's why it has to be part of the other commitments we've made, like the investment in the Strengthening Medicare Fund, where we've got the task force in place working with primary care, essentially rebuilding primary care, which is under so much strain. We're looking at the role delineation within primary care, so nurse practitioners and the work they do, and the announcement around meeting the HECS debts for health practitioners to work in the region is also part of it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In fact, we've profiled the money in this financial year, so the intention is to get them up and running as soon as possible. Working with the jurisdictions and with primary care, it might be that there are different starts in different jurisdictions as they get rolled out. We completely understand that this support needs to flow, but it's not something the federal government can do on its own. The money is there; it's profiled in that first year. We're going to work in partnership with those jurisdictions that want us to. And obviously those other investments, like the one to support staff that I talked about starting January this year and the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce, are in place. And the grants going to GPs—the $220 million worth of grants to help them accommodate their workload—is also funded in the budget.</span>

In March this year, the coalition announced a $1.6 billion commitment for the direct rail line from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast, which the Queensland government described as a bit of a surprise, and the money appeared plucked out of the sky. Again, if we're seriously going to be relying on the Liberal and National parties to lecture people about the appropriate spending of public money, we're going to have to be waiting a fair while.</span>

                  </a>  Here's a business case that's been provided by the Liberal Party and the National Party. I don't think it can be a prop, because it's a blank piece of paper. I'm not sure that that constitutes a prop. That's the extent of the business cases that we used to see from the Liberal and the National parties when it came to investing in projects. In contrast, the Victorian government has put forward a business case, which demonstrates this is a good project, and we have every intention of getting behind it.</span>

We know that the Victorian government has committed funding of its own. We know that this is a project that will take some time to complete. You know why it will take some time to complete? It's because the former government didn't want to invest in public transport infrastructure. So now we're getting on with the job of actually investing in this. It will take until 2035 to complete the project, and that will require future budget decisions.</span>

The Albanese government has committed to getting wages moving with its workplace relations policies, which will provide Australians with job security, gender equity and sustainable wage growth, after a decade of neglect by the Liberals and Nationals. Can the minister please outline the benefits of these policies to both Australian workers and businesses. Why is it important to get wages moving?</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying, I'm very happy that we're ending the week of question time speaking about the government's important industrial relations policies, which are all about helping people get a decent pay rise, because if there's one thing that drives this government, it's our ambition to deliver a decent pay rise for working Australians, and there are some pretty simple reasons why that is—not just because Australian workers both need and deserve a pay rise but also because good, sustainable wage growth is good for our economy. Our policies provide workers on low and middle incomes facing the pressure of inflation and interest rates with a way to also get pay rises, and the best way to do this is by encouraging more agreements to be made and stopping the race to the bottom on wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Australia's bargaining system has not worked effectively for a very long time—in fact, I would say for about 10 years. Only 15 per cent of employees are covered by an in-term agreement, and we want to make more agreements that benefit both employers and workers, rather than continue the conflict that we've seen over the last 10 years. Agreements allow trade-offs and provide a more simple and tailored set of conditions than the award, which benefits small business. To give one example of how this benefits small business, Jane has been an early childhood educator for 40 years. She's now the director of an early childhood education centre in Melbourne. She is incredibly passionate about her job, but it has been a tough industry to dedicate her life to. As the director of her centre she has faced constant struggles with staffing shortages, due to low wages and conditions in the sector. Jane and her sector, along with workers in 70 other sectors in Victoria, now benefit from being part of a multi-employer agreement, and not only have they won wages up to 18 per cent above the award; they've also won more things, like planning and professional development— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

For nearly 10 years, wages were kept low as a deliberate design feature of the previous government's management of the economy, and the scare campaigns being run now by those with vested interests are good media fodder but are completely unfounded. Let's fact-check some of the claims that have been made over the last couple of weeks by the coalition and some of their supporters. First of all they say there'll be coast-to-coast strikes, ignoring the fact that nothing in relation to the system for industrial action at all will change compared to the system that was under the former government, except for the fact that there will now be a requirement for conciliation first—an additional requirement before industrial action occurs.</span>

The Albanese Labor government's reforms and policies make bargaining more accessible for small and medium-sized businesses. It has been designed specifically to support those who are new to enterprise bargaining or are less equipped to navigate it. Small businesses often don't have the benefit of an HR department and can often be shut out of the benefits of enterprise bargaining that many medium- and larger-sized businesses enjoy. For those small businesses who do wish to bargain together, the cooperative bargaining stream is an attractive option as it's voluntary and they can opt in to the stream at any time. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look around and I see an Australia that's getting smarter and smarter and Australians that are getting tired of getting talked down to and controlled. Why is this? Union membership is heading to an all-time low. According to ABS statistics, just 14 per cent of employees were trade union members, and we're well down on the 40 per cent of employees who were trade union members back in the 1990s. Although those opposite want to take our industrial relations laws back to the Hawke-Keating years, we do not live in the Hawke-Keating years, Senator Ayres. Despite this, the Labor Party is intent on pursuing an industrial relations policy that lives in a fantasy land where everyone is beholden to a union, and that's what those opposite want. They want to take Australia backwards. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't get me wrong, we on this side of the chamber want changes to Australia's industrial relations system. To quote the Leader of the Opposition in parliament:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We all have a genuine desire to improve our industrial relations system. What we don't want is a system of control that those opposite want—a system that wants to control workers, to control where they can work, control what they can earn, control their lives inside and outside the workplace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The industrial relations legislation that the Labor government has been trying to pass is some of the most radical in decades. If this government gets what it wants—or should I say, what its union masters want—small business and the economy will suffer. Like most legislation from the Labor Party, it's small business that gets hit hardest because under Labor governments small businesses are on their own. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most dangerous parts of Labor's new industrial relations bill is the prospect of multi-employer bargaining. If it goes ahead, small business will face bargaining costs of $14,638. Don't take my word for it: this is according to the department's regulatory impact statement for the bill. Medium businesses would face costs of $75,148 and large businesses would face costs of $94,311. Unlike Labor and the union hacks who have never run a business in their life, I've actually run a business, and businesses know that they're hurting under this government. </span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's proposed changes will move Australia's industrial relations system from bargaining done at enterprise level, also known as bargaining with the businesses where you work, to bargaining done across multiple workplaces and potentially across a whole industry. This would massively expand the power of trade unions, allowing them to operate in businesses they currently have no connection to. This includes tens of thousands of small businesses right across Australia. Under Labor's legislation, multiple sectors will be able to engage in crippling, economy-wide strikes. Those opposite don't realise that enterprise-wide bargaining will mean industry-wide strikes and the breakdown of the Australian economy.</span>

                  </a>  I'm all cool. I'm having a ball. I actually ran my own business. This is what irks me when I hear ideology and ridiculous statements from people who have no idea of the background of others in this chamber. I, for one, can talk with the authority. I left school early. I ran my own business. My wife and I put our necks on the line with one month's payment and a house to hock everything we had to buy our first truck. Six trucks later and I'm proud as punch that we did that. I couldn't have done it without my wife, and I couldn't have done it without the drive that I had. To be accused of not knowing business really gets up my nose.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Van, in the first speech to this motion, came out and said that this is all about ideology. He said it has nothing to do with providing an opportunity for lower paid workers to get a decent pay packet and negotiate decent contracts. This is what really, really annoys me—I speak to this from authority—when we look at the likes of the bed wetters and the ones who are running around this country screaming out that the last thing that we should be doing is pushing to change industrial relations laws so that those who can't bargain collectively could actually have a chance to increase their pay packet and their working conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And who is this charge led by? It is the usual suspects, starting with ACCI. I'd be so sad if ACCI went missing because I'd think something had gone wrong and that they actually had some brains in that outfit. The Business Council of Australia is another, as is AMMA—if AMMA didn't start the fight, there's really something going on. Guess who started the fight? AMMA. And guess who else bought into it? None other than Mr Alan Joyce and Qantas. Senator Sheldon, you've got a massive pair of shoes to fill. I can't fill them when you're talking about how bad an employer Qantas has become under Mr Joyce's tenure, but I'll give it a good shot. Here we have a man who has his footprints etched into the blue carpet in this joint. He ran to the previous government's ministers, seeking support to give him money to give to his employees. Was it Work Choices?—I'm having a real nightmare today! It was through JobKeeper. That was nearly a billion dollars, and what did it deliver? I'll tell you what it delivered: it kept Mr Alan Joyce and Qantas going—ably backed by Mr Richard Goyder AO, with his $560,000 sitting fee and God knows whatever else as the chairman, so he could go out in the middle of the night and sack nearly 2,000 baggage handlers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I read in the paper today not only the fine comments from my colleague and mate over here to my right Senator Sheldon but that Qantas have to upgrade their profit margin now. We've only been out of COVID for seven or eight months or something, but they made a mistake: they have to up it by another $150 million. While Qantas are gouging the travellers of this nation, they're now saying that they're back in the red—anywhere between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. I ask everyone in Australia: who thinks Mr Alan Joyce has run a magnificent business since he's been in charge?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you now—and I look at my colleagues around this chamber from all sides—that we spent more time on his planes than anyone. I had no problem for many, many years as a Transport Workers Union organiser, after I sold my truck and after doing two years nonstop in Darwin, with two babies at home that I never got to see. I missed my daughter first walking and talking, and I wasn't going to miss more time with my six-year-old son. So I came off the road. The TWU gave me an opportunity because—guess what?—I actually know things about trucks, I actually can put two words together and I actually can talk to employers and employees. I want nothing more than employers and employees working together to deliver magnificent outcomes for both. Without a successful business, you don't have the opportunity to provide an appropriate wage for your employees, who I was so proud to have join me in my union so that we could collectively bargain. I have the greatest of respect for them, but I have absolutely no respect for Alan Joyce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you fly in this nation, you could be gouged, lose your baggage or be lied to whilst you're sitting on the tarmac. And then they're blaming baggage handlers, an explanation which I copped this morning, and there wasn't even any baggage being put on. This is what really irks me.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I too rise to take note of answers given during question time today by Ministers Watt and Farrell. It is very, very clear, colleagues, that the old saying is true: leopards do not change their spots. It has taken very little time—in fact, less than six months—for it to become crystal clear to the Australian public why Labor was in opposition for nearly a decade. It is so clear that they have not yet learnt. Just as they have done before in government, they are taking both our workplace relations system and our economy backwards at the same time. They simply cannot be trusted, not only on their word but on their ability to manage our nation through challenging times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we already seen in less than six months under a Labor government? We have an economy with high inflation, we have high interest rates, we've got a rising cost of living and Labor have had to admit that electricity prices under their policies will go up 56 per cent and gas up 44 per cent, together putting unsustainable cost-of-living pressures on everyday Australians. They talk a lot about solutions, but they have done absolutely nothing this year in a policy sense to change any of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now the Albanese government's reckless attempts to change industrial relations laws will hit every single sector of our economy and, in particular, every single small business in our nation, who are the absolute backbone of our economy. They are going to be hit the hardest. Shame on Labor for that. The cost of bargaining under the Albanese government's radical shake-up of the industrial relations system was revealed at just under $15,000 for a small business and $75,000 for a medium-sized business. How on earth is any small business going to find another $15,000 just to comply with what Labor are imposing on them? Most of them will no doubt not be able to afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the impact of this in my own home state of Western Australia. The <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> has reported that small businesses across WA could, if not will, be pushed to the brink if Labor's one-size-fits-all industrial relations omnibus bill is rammed through the federal parliament this and next week. That is very clear. What does our own Premier, the Premier of Western Australia, a Labor Premier, say about this? Is he backing small businesses? Is he backing Western Australian families? Is he backing employers who are already doing it tough? Nope, of course he is not backing any one of those groups in Western Australia. In fact, he says that what we're saying about all of these pressures is just scaremongering. I tell you what, if he was a small-business man who had to put his hand in his pocket, with all of the other cost-of-living and cost-of-doing-business expenses, to find another $15,000 to comply with this, he would not see it as scaremongering, because it is the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A poll taken by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia is the first in the country to reveal the true sentiment of Australian businesses to these reforms. It revealed that more than nine in 10 Western Australian businesses fear impending change to industrial relations laws, and only eight per cent said they were unconcerned by the changes. Thirty-four thousand workplaces would employ fewer staff if they were no longer able to set their own work conditions and had them replaced by the Fair Work Commission. Twelve thousand businesses would employ fewer people if limits on fixed-term contracts were put in place, as is proposed by those opposite. More than four in 10 businesses would scale down operations if forced into multi-employer bargaining or immediate bargaining for a new agreement when the existing one expires. This, more than any of the other destructive elements of their bill, is the most duplicitous, because this was not in the Labor Party policies that they took to the election. They had a workforce summit—and guess what? Surprise, surprise, this popped out of the union's mouths and the Labor Party said, 'Oh, we didn't think of that before the election, but let's implement it and let's destroy our businesses.' Shame on you, Labor.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  We come to a situation here in the Senate where we get a number of speakers from the opposition who get up and talk about industrial relations. In actual fact, they even have the hide to talk about being the representatives of small businesses. Senator Sterle set them straight. In actual fact, I have the great pleasure of saying I was the elected head of the largest small-business organisation in this country, the Transport Workers Union of Australia, with over 15,000 owner-drivers. I know that whenever I went into a workplace I wanted to make sure there was an outcome where the company was successful, the industry was successful and those workers got a fair deal, whether they were a small-business person or an employee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All those chimpanzees on the other side of this chamber are saying they're going to make sure that they do what they're told by the big gorillas—the ones that were called out by Steve Knott—because those big gorillas give them bananas; they just won't share them with the rest of the country. The fact is, small business is getting it in the neck, under these laws that were stood over by this opposition when they were in government. We have to have a law that turns around and makes sure that we can lift productivity. Productivity gets lifted when groups of workers come together and collectively bargain with their employer and—heaven forbid—across an industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been in industries and have seen industries where employers that are in the middle of the supply chain are continually stood over by the top of the supply chain—the big gorillas that they are protecting, the ones who have the hide to come in here and represent ACCI and others and have turned around and supported not small business but big business. If you really talk to small business, they'll say it's those economic employers who engage them that are the problem, because they're the ones who don't turn around and make sure their payments are made on time. They're the ones who give them 120 days. They're the ones who turn around and say, 'I can't train my staff,' because it's a race to the bottom. They say, 'I can't turn around and give them a pay increase, to keep my experienced staff in the business, because my competition will go lower and it's a race to the bottom.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to go to Alan Joyce to see that. Now that's the big gorilla. They're the people they are supporting. It's not just them or even Alan Joyce; it's companies like Amazon, these international companies that are competing with small and other businesses that are stealing their arrangements. What they're doing is undercutting, by turning around and having multiple labour hire companies, having very few people on decent wages, refusing to have bargaining arrangements. They sack people because they're pregnant. They sack them because they're in a union. They sack them when they try to organise. They're the people they're standing up for. They don't want the system changed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wait a second—they do want the system changed. Only in this last number of days, and again this morning, Angus Taylor said the system is working okay. Wages aren't going up—that's why he said it's working okay. Small businesses are getting done over by those big gorillas because they can't keep and train their staff, they can't get the wages across their markets, and sometimes that's even negotiations across government contracts. They have to have the capacity, in the private and government sectors, to bargain when they want to, when there's an appropriate way to do that. Workers have a right to say that, as business has a right to say that, and parties have a right and obligation to come around and negotiate an agreement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If an employer says, 'I want to negotiate an agreement across the site,' they have a right to do that. If an employee—more than 50 per cent plus one—says, 'I want to negotiate an agreement across the site,' they have a right to do that. Heaven forbid! That's where you have an equal voice. That's where you have equal opportunity. That's where you can turn around and start moving wages up. When wages go up, people start talking about how to make it more efficient, more effective, with better training and skills, and, heaven forbid, productivity goes up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to look at the ACHC that gave evidence to the inquiry. You only have to look at what was said by the Victorian early childhood educators and their employer association. They said that's how they got better conditions, better arrangements, not just for the workforce; these small multiple employers all got together and said, 'Let's do it together.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last big myth is when Senator Reynolds talked about this $15,000. It was in place—right now—without any law change! The fact is, you make a choice whether you want to do it or not. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANTIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I was loath to stand up and interject then, because Senator Sheldon was recounting what appeared to be a game of Donkey Kong Country there, with his analogies about gorillas and bananas. I was lost in the theatre of it all. But I'll tell you what I'm not lost on: the radical, dangerous and ill-conceived rushed bill that we're seeing coming through our parliament as we speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the most significant changes in our industrial relations system in decades. They are, ultimately, changes that will do exactly what we all know. This is not Super Nintendo. This is not a game of Donkey Kong Country. This is a very serious matter. These are the first stages in handing back the keys to this country to the militant union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we're already seeing this in South Australia, where there are already reports of the John Setka led CFMMEU taking the reins of the South Australian branch and starting to swing the axe. And why wouldn't they? They now have Labor governments at both the state and federal levels, both of whom are paving the way for what we know is going to be a terrible time for business. This is not an issue of people talking about their personal stories, which are excellent stories—Senator Sterle spoke about basically a small business story. These are stories about the imposts that are going to be put on business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard them from the Albanese government's regulatory impact statement, which has said, very clearly, that the costs associated with this bill are going to be significant: $14,638 for small businesses and $75,148 for a medium business. Those ain't small bananas; they are serious, serious imposts. And they're real; they're not made up. They are absolutely real and they're now written down. Labor have made it clear that they don't care about small businesses. Small businesses do well for workers when they're profitable, but they don't do well when they're getting hit for sums of money like that. Labor have made it clear that they're going to hand all workplaces over to the unions, whether small or large. Industry-wide bargaining is simply set now to increase the number of strikes across the economy. We've seen this before; we saw it through the Hawke-Keating era and we're going to see it again. This is going to be devastating for the Australian economy and it's going to be devastating for Australian businesses, with widespread strike action and, potentially, sympathy strikes by those unrelated to a potential dispute. We saw this in the 1970s; it has happened before and history is repeating itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in this room wants higher wages for every Australian, but there's no evidence that the reforms will ever deliver higher wages. In fact we know, based on comments from businesses and employers, the evidence is that it will be quite the opposite. This is just a fact: Labor's legislation is going to lead to more strikes and more job losses, and it's going to allow unions into small businesses, which have never really had to deal with them before. Take a business, for example, like Crane Services, which was reported on last week in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide Advertiser</span>. That's a fine publication; as you all know, I'm a great fan of it—that's me being ironic, by the way, in case anyone wants to hear about that! But that's not on point and I'll come to that later on. The article said that the boss of an Adelaide crane company said that the livelihoods of the workers were at stake as a stand-off with the militant CFMMEU neared the end of its fourth day, at that stage. This is a family owned business, just like in the story that Senator Sterle told about a family owned business. It's now going to be stood over by Mr Setka and his 'colleagues'—we'll use that terminology. There is absolutely no question about that. There will be unreasonable demands for conditions like a 25 per cent wage rise in one year. Businesses can't stomach this sort of knee-jerk reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These laws are also going to hold up wage rises because of the complexity of the system. We're now seeing more imposts put on businesses, which are now going to have to get to grips with various different systems. This is going to undermine competition and therefore Australians are going to have fewer choices and higher costs. It's going to force up prices and increase the cost of living—all, by the way, at a time when the country cannot afford it. Thanks to the conditions imposed here, we're all living through growing inflation, higher costs of living and higher energy costs. We have lots of batteries and wind farms though, which is good—lots of batteries and wind farms. They're doing a great job for the grid, by the way, while we're on the subject— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Wong) to a question without notice I asked today relating to soft plastic recycling.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to be standing in the Senate today and asking, on behalf of the Australian Greens, the hard questions of this government on an issue that matters to millions of Australians. I know that a lot of senators in this chamber have received correspondence in recent weeks about the collapse of REDcycle, a soft-plastics recycling facility. People are furious and frustrated. After all these years of doing the right thing, of collecting their soft plastics and taking them back to the supermarket—which, by the way, they have no choice about at all—they find out that those plastics are being stockpiled by a company that actually can't get them recycled. No-one's buying the recycled content from the recycler.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big packaging companies produce this plastic waste—this pollution—and companies order it to wrap just about every grocery item in plastic. Nobody wants it but they get it anyway. Do you know why this scheme has collapsed, Mr Deputy President? Do you know why we're about to find out that our 2025 packaging targets have also failed? There are a number of reasons, but the key reason is that the big companies that produce this stuff don't give a rat's arse about what happens to it. They really don't. They have no producer responsibility; they do not care. They put it all back onto the consumer: 'If you use these products, it's up to you to dispose of them.' But what's a consumer to do when there are no options?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked Senator Wong today: why is it seemingly beyond these companies to actually come up with a scheme to recycle these soft plastics properly? Actually, that was based on a quote from our Minister for the Environment and Water. Out of frustration, on the day this was announced, Minister Plibersek said, 'It shouldn't be beyond big companies like Coles and Woolworths to come up with a viable solution to soft-plastic packaging recycling.' Do you know why they don't care? Because they know the government don't care. They have, since 1998, under the Australian Packaging Covenant, repeatedly failed to meet even the most basic recycling or packaging waste reduction targets, and they have never once been penalised. That's because this scheme is voluntary. It has always been voluntary. There has been no-one in this building or even at a state government level through the COAG process who has been willing to take on the big packaging companies—companies like Coca-Cola and the big grocery companies, who are, may I say, just as a passing comment, big donors to both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian people have had enough. Senator Polley, I'll take that interjection. They have had enough of big governments failing to act on this recycling crisis. We need to ask ourselves: if we find out that the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, APCO, which is now an accredited voluntary product stewardship scheme under the new act, are not going to meet their 2025 targets—they're three years away, but we were told we would know by the end of this year—what are the government going to do? Are they going to let this pollution continue? Are they going to continue to let down Australians? I hope they do the only thing they can do to fix this crisis—step up and regulate these companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regulating these companies is something the Greens tried to force two years ago in the Senate debate when the legislation came in. We had a tied vote on mandating these targets so that these companies had no choice but to meet them and, if they didn't, there would be consequences. I remind senators—those of you who were here two years ago—that we had a tied vote and it was Senator Hanson who walked away from the deal we thought we had with her to pass mandatory regulatory targets. The government cast the deciding vote from the chair, and we lost that debate. Surprise, surprise! Two years later we've had a massive failure of soft-plastic recycling, and we're about to find out that our national targets, run by big business and led by big business through the Packaging Covenant, are also going to fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask senators to reflect on this as a final point. The Greens aren't going to stop asking questions on this. We're not going to stop putting up good ideas. We're going to continually needle you until you do something about this—and I say that to both parties. This should be across political lines, because this issue cuts across political lines. All sides of politics want to see better recycling. They want to see waste reduction. They do not want to see plastic pollution in our oceans, killing our marine life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital </span><span class="HPS-Electorate">Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:40</span>):  Tomorrow is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which also commences 16 days of activism against gender based violence. It's a time when we come together across the world to call for an end to violence against women, and I thank the Senate for the opportunity for all of us to make contributions today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year we ask the same thing: how do we end violence against women? Like most people, I am sick of asking, sick of having to say, 'Let's not hit women; let's not kill women; let's not accept the all-too-many cases of a woman's partner controlling her movements, bank accounts, work and freedom.' Like so many, I'm sick of asking each year for men to stop being violent to women—something we should never have to ask or demand. As Chief Minister, as a senator and now as the Minister for Women, I've heard from too many women about their trauma, their frustration, their fear, the loss of their friends, the loss of their loved ones, and the impact on their lives and their children's. The violence has to end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lot to be proud of in this country, but the rates of violence against women and children that persist in Australia are our national shame and an uncomfortable truth. It's a national shame that one woman is killed every 10 days in Australia by her former or current partner, that one in three women have experienced violence by an intimate partner, that one in two women have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime, that 51 per cent of women in their 20s have experienced sexual violence, and who are then 45 per cent more likely to experience high levels of financial stress. It's an uncomfortable reality: if you asked the women in this chamber to put their hands up if they have experienced violence, sexual assault or sexual harassment in their lifetime, how many of us would put our hands up. It's the same in every workplace, every home, every small business, every big business, every educational institution, every nightclub, every restaurant—everywhere. If you asked women if they have experienced violence or know someone who has, all of our hands would go up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Behind these statistics I just read out are the millions of women in Australia who live with this violence—hundreds of thousands who are living with this violence today, women who carry trauma with them every day, women each year who live with increasingly lower expectations of anything ever changing. There must be an end to women becoming statistics or names on the front page of a newspaper. There's a temporary outcry and calls for change, and then the next day it still goes on. We must have an end to women being subjected to fear and trauma—often in their own homes by men that they love and trust—and an end to men choosing to use violence and control and not being held to account or changing their behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the statements made yesterday in the other place on this important issue ahead of International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, including comments by the Minister for Social Services, Amanda Rishworth, who is leading our work to end gender based violence through the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children, and by the shadow minister for child protection and the prevention of family violence, Karen Andrews, who spoke so candidly about the devastating impact of this violence on victims-survivors and those people around them. These statements reinforce the cross-party commitment on this issue, an issue that requires action from all of us—men and women—in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working with states and territories, through the national plan, to end violence against women and children in a generation because one death is one death too many. The national plan includes a powerful statement from victims-survivors of gender based violence. It implores us to put their experiences at the core of our policymaking and to truly listen to them. It reminds us that this is a matter of life and death. In that statement it says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We should not have to die to get your attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's confronting, but it's a message that we must hear. Ending this violence will save lives, because right now women and their children are dying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to acknowledge the all-too-many women who have experienced domestic, family and sexual violence, the women who relived this experience of trauma in order to advocate for change, the women who live with the enduring emotional, physical and financial impacts of violence and the women who are not here today because their lives have been stolen by the deliberate acts of others—often those that they loved. I acknowledge the activists who have spent years and decades calling for action and the frontline workers who are on the ground supporting those victims-survivors to access help, support and justice. We know we've made a start, with the national plan and the investments to provide consent and respectful relationships education, to provide additional frontline service and community support workers, to prevent violence before it begins and intervene early to support men to change their behaviour, to respond to victims-survivors' needs and support their healing and recovery, and to implement all the recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report so that women are safe at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also looking at our investments in relation to housing. We know this is a massive issue for women wanting to escape violent situations with their children and also for older women, who we know are such a significant and growing group of people who are at risk of homelessness in this country. We've passed legislation to provide paid family and domestic violence leave. There is also the important work that's being led by Minister Rishworth and Minister Burney on a standalone First Nations action plan to sit under the national plan. There is work going on there, and from consultations to date we know that it is a national priority to finalise those action plans and get them in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are targeting a key driver of violence against women through our work to advance gender equality. We know that, whilst the statistics remain as they are and the prevalence of violence remains as it is, we will not be able to achieve a country with gender equality at its core. This work includes investments in paid parental leave, early childhood education and our work to develop that national strategy. I know there's a lot of interest in the national strategy and people want the consultation process to get underway, and we welcome all of the input and the support that will be provided there. We are hoping to finalise that national strategy in the first half of next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that gender inequality is not only a key driver of gender based violence but also a result of it, with long-term impacts on women, their economic participation and the economy, and on their children. The cost of violence against women and their children has been estimated to be $26 billion a year, with victims-survivors bearing approximately 50 per cent of that cost. We know that we need to take action, and we'll continue to act, to listen, to consult and to talk with local communities. But we can't do it alone; we must work in partnership with a whole range of stakeholders, including all levels of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year when we have this day, I always am frustrated at the fact that we have to recognise this day each year because the prevalence of violence remains at this unacceptable level. But I am also optimistic. I believe in the aspiration of the national plan. I believe in the strength and support of the sector in driving to reach that goal—a goal which imagines a society that is free from gender based violence. It is ambitious, but if we work together we can achieve it. We know the importance of achieving it, because lives will be lost if we don't achieve it, and lives depend on us getting this policy response right. I'm proud that so many people in this place share this vision, determination and commitment. I acknowledge the work of Senator Waters, who has consistently and often in this place raised this to remind people of what's happening out there in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Living free from violence is a human right. Women have the right to be safe in their homes, at work, in the community and online. So tomorrow, throughout the 16 days of activism and on all days, I encourage everyone to unite and consider the role they have to play and the actions they can take. Let's imagine a society without violence against women and children and let's commit to achieving an Australia and a world where all women and girls live free from violence and from fear.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">tor BIRMINGHAM</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I thank the government for providing this time for the chamber. As we mark another International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women—acknowledged, around the world, tomorrow—we should commence by remembering, 12 months on since the last day, those women and children across Australia and around the world who have lost their lives due to unacceptable, unforgiveable acts of violence. We should recall and remember those victims-survivors who have felt pain, anguish and loss through that period of time, whose lives have been changed forever as a result of the unacceptable actions of others. We should also recall those who are brave and who drive and work for change. We have come a long way across the globe, but we still have a very long way to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women has been observed on 25 November since at least 1981. Activists across the world selected that date to honour the Mirabal sisters, three political activists from the Dominican Republic who were brutally murdered in 1960. It has been recognised by and at the UN General Assembly since at least 1999 as the official day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia, we have continued to recognise but also, most importantly, continued to do more. I want, early in my remarks, to particularly thank and acknowledge those who have ensured that we all do more and better understand, including men like me. It's important, critical, on occasions like this for men to take responsibility and to speak out too. In contemplating this time for the chamber today, we discussed whether my good friend, Senator Hume or I would lead the debate for the coalition. I decided that I should and that it's appropriate to do so, and it's appropriate for all of us to take and accept the responsibility that comes with doing so. But, with that, I acknowledge it is people like Senator Hume, Senator Payne, Senator Ruston and others across the chamber, on the crossbench, in the other chamber and perhaps even more so in the community, who have helped to educate me, as with many other men, about the responsibilities that we must take and accept to recognise the problems of violence against women, to understand those problems, to speak out and to call them out, and to support action for prevention and for support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased last night to join the team and supporters of Our Watch for their annual event, thankfully back in person in this parliament after a couple of years of remote attendance. I was there with Senator Waters and others from around the chamber and across the parliament, as I and others have been before. The work of Our Watch and so many other organisations is crucial too, as their evidence based framework to guide the national approach to preventing violence against women says: 'Change the story. Change the story from one of perpetual death, violence and loss. Change the story to one in which future generations can have the type of hope and opportunity that we expect all to enjoy.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of us lead fortunate lives. Most of us are lucky to avoid this type of violence, but far too many are touched by it. For those who have been so fortunate it is a responsibility for us to work and to do more. There are many causes of violence, but they all begin with disrespect against those that the violence is perpetuated against—disrespect in this case against women, against partners, against family members, against people who are meant to be loved ones—and it is that disrespect that we must work fundamentally to overcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the fundamental pillars in overcoming that disrespect is to achieve greater equality. Again, Australia and much of the world have made huge steps, but we have many more steps to take. I was proud that during our time in government we were able to see the majority—around 60 per cent—of new jobs created go to women and to see women's workforce participation reach record highs. I was pleased to see the gender pay gap close somewhat, but it still remains unacceptably high. I was pleased to be part of a government that provided funding through significant women's budget statements, particularly in my time as Minister for Finance—some $5.5 billion over the last two women's budget statements—across different spheres in relation to support, for health care, for academic activity and, critically, for women's safety. In the most recent budget there's a further $1.3 billion of support.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the funding itself is inconsequential without great organisations and successful and effective evidence based programs to help back it up—the work of Our Watch, Stop It at the Start, and Respectful Relationships, and effective education platforms. We're expanding domestic violence alert training. There's support in terms of domestic violence payments, emergency accommodation, legal protections, reforms in relation to cross-examination, frameworks that ensure perpetrators are held to account, and medical programs. There are a whole raft of initiatives that are crucial and are supported across our country, but no doubt they need continued support to help achieve the type of ambition that we have, which under the national plan is to end violence in a generation. It's ambitious and it will be difficult, but it is absolutely worth pursuing. It's a goal that we across all parties should remain sincerely and deeply committed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, and I'm sure all others across the chamber, join in pledging to do what I can do and what we can to help ensure that we eliminate violence against women and children in our country, but we also act as an exemplar and a messenger to the rest of the world, recognising that in many other parts of the world the unacceptable grave statistics that we hear about our country are replicated and are even worse. We have that responsibility in our region, with other partners and in other cultures to do what we respectfully can to educate, support and affect change, be it here across our broad country and the many cultures represented here or elsewhere in many different and diverse circumstances, so that ultimately all women and girls can look to a life of safety, opportunity and equality.</span>

I also welcome the fact that we are having this debate in the Senate, as they did in the House yesterday. It's appropriate. I thank the government for that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It also marks the start of the 16 days of activism to end gendered violence globally. As with all international days, it is a reason to pause and reflect, but that cannot be the sum total of our attention on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Globally one in three women have experienced physical or sexual abuse in their lifetime. Of those women only one in 10 go to the police for help. Of those who go to the police for help, many never have their complaints taken seriously and properly investigated or their abusers charged, and even fewer than that manage to secure a prosecution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These statistics are shockingly familiar in Australia. We can't claim to be doing any better than our neighbours. We can't pretend that sexism and disrespect don't underline the culture in many workplaces, clubs and homes in our country. In Australia, one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence since they were 15. On average, one woman is killed by a current or former partner every nine days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year 40 women have been killed. When we used to have motions I used to recognise the names of the women who had been killed since the last motion. Unfortunately, we've lost the procedural ability to recognise those women, but we won't forget them. We know the figure is at 40 because a volunteer organisation tracks them, not because we have a national toll of women killed, which is something that the Greens have pushed for for years and still think would be a very meritorious idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note that First Nations women experience significantly higher rates of violence throughout their lives and reiterate our support for a standalone national plan to end violence against First Nations women and children that is designed, implemented and evaluated by First Nations women and community controlled organisations. First Nations women know what needs to be done to end violence in their communities, and they need to be empowered to take action. My colleague Senator Cox will speak about the importance of that work in her contribution. She is currently with another colleague, Senator Thorpe, at an event to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the establishment of the inquiry into missing and murdered First Nations women and the appalling fact that a lot of violence against First Nations women goes unreported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last few years in particular have laid bare the pervasive nature of gendered violence across Australia. Brave young women have come forward and forced this conversation onto the national agenda. We've all talked about it many times, but despite this, on a lot of metrics, the first national plan to reduce violence against women and their children failed. Violence against women remains shockingly high. Sexual assault amongst people under 25 has actually increased. Things need to change. I'm very pleased that the second national plan commits to ending gendered violence within a generation. It's an ambitious goal, but it's critical that we all work together to make that happen. We can't just keep coming back and making speeches about how things need to change. Things actually need to change. Many, often survivors themselves, work behind the scenes to support survivors to get justice or just peace and safety to rebuild their lives. We owe it to those women to do everything we can to end gendered violence now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stopping this violence starts with believing and listening to survivors and learning from their experience so that others don't have to suffer the same harm. The victim-survivor statement in the national plan is a powerful call to action, to listen, to hear, to act, and the new Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner, Micaela Cronin, has been tasked with ensuring that all actions are grounded in the experience of victims-survivors. It is tough and critical work. We need survivor-centred essential services that understand and respect survivor experiences and don't compound trauma when help is sought. This requires specialist services that understand the specific needs of First Nations women, young women, older women, disabled women, LGBTIQ+ women and women from culturally diverse backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stopping violence against women will take systemic action to tackle root causes, transform harmful social norms and empower women and girls. Gender inequality and gender stereotypes foster disrespect. All of the evidence confirms a correlation between rigid gender stereotypes and rates of violence, so small things like calling out casual sexism will actually help to drive the cultural change that, ultimately, will stop so many women being killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Individuals must be held to account, but we have to go beyond individual behaviours, and we have to consider the broader social, political and economic factors that drive violence against women. We must promote the equal distribution of power, resources and opportunities between men and women. We know that you can't be what you can't see and that workplaces like ours should be showing leadership in the representation of women in decision-making roles. We do okay in the Senate, but our friends in the House have a long way to go to reach gender parity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, stopping gendered violence requires properly funding the organisations that do the work on the front lines of this epidemic. In estimates a few weeks ago we learned that the government doesn't have any data on unmet need, but I hear from services on a very regular basis that every day they have to turn women away from shelters, from calls to support services and from legal services because they don't have enough funding to help everyone who reaches out for help. The sector have repeatedly said that it will take an investment of $1 billion a year to make sure that they're able to help everyone who reaches out for that help. That's the absolute minimum that women should expect from their government, but the government delivered less than half of that amount in the recent budget. What a tragic missed opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to also fund prevention programs. Respectful relationships curriculum needs to be embedded from early education onward. Targeted prevention programs, workplace training to make sure employers can identify and act on abusive behaviour—we must effectively engage men and boys in that prevention work. Some positive men's behaviour change programs were funded in the budget, and we welcome that. Men need to take responsibility, and they need to be better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need proper investment in housing, in crisis accommodation, in transitional housing and in long-term affordable housing options. No woman should have to choose between violence and homelessness, yet that is the consistent evidence that we have received from frontline organisations for years. It's particularly acute for older women. No-one should be turned away because a shelter doesn't have enough beds, but, unless women are confident they've got somewhere to go, too many will stay in dangerous situations. Delays in accessing crisis or social housing can literally cost women their lives. The recent budget allocation of $100 million for 720 homes for DV survivors is a drop in the ocean of what is required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also desperately need to lift income support and raise wages so that women have the financial security they need to get free, to seek help, to stay safe and to leave if they need to. We know that it can take 140 hours and at least $18,000, on average, to escape an abusive relationship. That's something that women on low incomes or in insecure work simply don't have. We strongly welcome the introduction of paid family and domestic violence leave just a few weeks ago. That's an important safety net, but more needs to be done. The government's escaping violence payments, which are designed to provide emergency funding to help women escape abuse, are oversubscribed. Women are having to wait 28 business days to access funds. I'm sorry, but that's not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to recognise and understand the insidious forms of violence and abuse, including coercive control and financial abuse. We know that up to 70,000 women were coerced into withdrawing their super early during COVID. Earlier this week, the Centre for Women's Economic Safety shone a light on the role that banks could play in ensuring that financial products like credit cards, mortgage payments and bank transfer descriptions can't be weaponised. We call on the banking industry to do that voluntarily and, if they won't, for government to work to regulate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to address the culture in our policing and legal systems, which have let women down time and time again. The review of the culture within the Queensland Police Service released this week is devastating but, sadly, deeply unsurprising reading. It can't be a mystery to anyone why so many women choose not to report. We need holistic, expert wraparound services and alternative pathways for reporting and addressing violence. We need to understand the experience of victims-survivors who say that the legal process was re-traumatising, and we need to listen to them about what needs to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night I attended an Our Watch event, and I want to acknowledge the work that they do as the premier experts on prevention. They're an incredible resource, and I urge everyone in this place to take a look at their resources. As for workplaces, I look forward to discussing <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> tonight. I will conclude by saying ending violence against women and children is a job for all of us. We've all got to make this happen within this generation, if not before.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  Tomorrow is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. This day is a global call to action, when we are being asked to unite in activism to end violence against women and against girls. We know that worldwide one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence, mostly by an intimate partner. These aren't just international statistics, though; these are statistics reflected in the Australian experience. It's one in three here too. We know that on average one woman every 10 days in Australia will be killed by an intimate partner. When we include sexual harassment in the picture, it is even bleaker: 53 per cent of women will have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime. These are women we know, women we love—this is us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian has the right to live a life free from violence, whether at home, at school, at work or in their community. And violence is not inevitable. We know this. That's why we're taking action as a government to end it. I acknowledge where there has been bipartisan support to do that, and I acknowledge the work of many senators in this place who have made that work part of their core mission and core business in the Senate and in public life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we are committed to addressing the underlying factors that drive gender based violence as well as rates of violence, and we've backed this up with a record $1.7 billion worth of investment. As senators here know, in October our government released the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. This is the national policy framework which will guide our efforts and actions over the next decade. Along with the states and territories, our government has committed to a shared goal of ending gendered violence within one generation. It's an ambitious goal, and for it to be achieved it will require tangible actions. The plan outlines actions to address gender discrimination, implement prevention strategies and embed effective early intervention approaches, and importantly it outlines actions that will build the frontline sector workforce to ensure women and children can access tailored and culturally safe support no matter where they live. As Senator Waters said so eloquently, we know that whilst this is an issue which affects all women in our community, it does affect certain women in our community more than others. That includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, and that is why there will also be a standalone plan focused on domestic and family violence against First Nations women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work under this plan is important, but so too are the other policies our government has been working on, including paid family and domestic violence leave, our work and significant and substantial investments in housing and our work in implementing the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. I'm proud of these policies, I'm proud to be part of a government that recognises the fundamental right of women and children to live safely and without fear and I'm proud of the bipartisan efforts to come together on this mission and this goal. This isn't an easy fix; it requires all of us, not just in government but across all parts of our communities, to work together to drive the systemic changes required to stop this type of violence at its core, to stand up and to loudly and fiercely say that we will not stand for domestic and family violence anymore, that we will not stand for violence against women and children, that we will take action, that we will invest the money required to do so and that we won't stop fighting until every single woman and child feels safe in their home, in their school, in their workplace, in their community, in this country, in the world. No lesser goal is worthy of our efforts. No lesser goal will do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I rise also to lend my contribution to this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, held on 25 November each year. Addressing violence against women remains at the forefront of women's issues right around the world and in Australia as well. I once went to an event to raise money for an organisation that assists women fleeing from domestic violence, and the MC said to the audience, 'Ladies, look into your partner's eyes.' People all dressed up in their ball gowns looked adoringly into their partner's eyes, and then the MC said, 'This is the man whose hands you are most likely to die in.' Of course, there was an uncomfortable titter around the room, but when people thought about what that actually meant it was extraordinarily confronting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than half the women killed around the world in 2017 died at the hands of an intimate partner or of a relative. That was around 50,000 women. On average, each week in Australia a woman is killed by a violent or controlling male whom she knows. It's harrowing, it's disturbing and it is totally unacceptable. The figures and statistics don't end there. One in four Australian women have had experiences of physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner, and in all likelihood we know many of these victims-survivors. Indeed there are likely to be many in here today. Intimate partner violence contributes to more deaths, more disabilities and more illnesses in Australian women aged between 15 and 44 than any other preventable risk factor. That includes smoking. It includes obesity. It includes high blood pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stories of family and domestic violence are distressing, and they stay with you. From my home state of Victoria I think of Poonam Sharma and her six-year-old daughter, Vanessa, stabbed in their home in Mill Park in January this year by her husband. I think of Kylie Griffiths, a mother of six, whose husband set fire to their home in Albanvale. I think of Shirley Kidd, a grandmother who died of fatal injuries in Bacchus Marsh. Of course, no-one can forget the horrific story of Hannah Clarke and her three children in Queensland. It doesn't bear repeating. There are, unfortunately, so many names across Australia, and we hear these stories constantly from police, from nurses, from doctors, from careworkers, from family and from friends, helpless and grieving. We hear them also from the victims-survivors whose lives will never be the same. These stories remind us that, despite the progress we've made as a society, there is still so much that can and must be done. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The dedication of this day gives us an opportunity to reflect on, to confront and to oppose violence towards women—the blight that has transcended time, culture and location. While it is a global issue, that is no excuse for inaction. It must be addressed domestically, it must be addressed locally and it must be addressed culturally as well. All forms of family and domestic violence have their genesis in lack of respect for a partner. We need to change our behaviour, change our thoughts, change our values and change our levels of tolerance for this behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very proud that, in government, the coalition committed a total of $2 billion since 2013 to address family and domestic violence through programs that focused on prevention, early intervention, response and recovery. We funded initiatives like Our Watch and 'Stop it at the Start', which was an extraordinarily successful campaign around changing attitudes. It was recognised by three in five adults, encouraging action towards more respectful relationships. We expanded DV-alert training. The escaping violence payment, which was a new initiative, delivered tailored assistance to victims-survivors who were escaping relationships, providing wraparound services to those who wanted to flee a dangerous home. Other initiatives included maintaining protection against cross-examination by family violence perpetrators and increasing legal assistance, including family advocacy support services, children's contact services and the very well-known—in fact, part of the vernacular now—1800RESPECT service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so important that we continue a bipartisan response to this. Women must feel safe, free from violence and free from fear in order to be equal. The responsibility for this lies with us all.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I thank Senator Gallagher for her statement about the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Sadly, many people have become numb to the shocking global statistics on violence against women and children. More than a billion women worldwide—or around one in three—have experienced physical or sexual violence. Some of the most shocking forms of abuse include child sexual abuse, child marriage, human trafficking and slavery, and female genital mutilation. Of course, we know that violence around the world isn't perpetrated exclusively against women and girls, but women and girls are overwhelmingly and disproportionately the victims of it. Many proud Australians would like to think of our country as being the envy of the world and much more enlightened. In many respects we are. We are a wealthy, peaceful, democratic country that values freedom and the rule of law. But, when it comes to violence against women and children, this is one area where, to our great shame, we have made far less progress than we should have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, one woman is killed by a current or former intimate partner every 10 days. Almost 10 women a day are hospitalised for assault injuries perpetrated by a spouse or domestic partner. Police are called to a domestic or family violence matter every two minutes. One in three women have experienced physical violence and one in five women have experienced sexual violence from the age of 15. A little over half—53 per cent—of women, have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime. We all know that the situation is worse for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. For example, in 2018-19, Indigenous women were 29 times as likely as non-Indigenous women to be hospitalised as a result of non-fatal family violence assaults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence against women and/or children is estimated to cost Australia $26 billion a year, but that dollar figure doesn't account for the enormous physical, emotional and psychological costs that victims experience. As has been said, tomorrow is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the theme for this year is 'UNiTE: Activism to end violence against women and girls'. A global campaign of 16 days of activism starts tomorrow and concludes on 10 December, or international Human Rights Day. We cannot underestimate the value and the power of awareness of this issue as just a first step to eliminating violence. Much of the problem of violence against women happens behind closed doors, and so raising awareness helps to bring it out in the open. The Me Too movement has been instrumental in showing the prevalence of sexual assault and sexual harassment. It has empowered victims-survivors to speak out and to show others that they are not alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years I worked as an early childhood educator. As one of the co-chairs of Australian Parliamentarians for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, APPCAN, I want to highlight the impact the culture of violence against women and children actually has on children. It manifests in the violence against girls perpetuated by adult men. It manifests in the sexual harassment experienced by girls in school, in sport, in day-to-day living. It manifests in boys who have grown up in a culture of toxic masculinity and who have not learnt how to have healthy, respectful relationships. It manifests in the trauma experienced by children—boys and girls—when they witness family violence at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting children from this violence takes on a particular significance, not just because of the vulnerability of children but because of the effects it has on them later in life. If gender based violence is normalised for children, boys who grow to become men will often learn it is acceptable to treat women that way, and girls who grow to become women will not be empowered to escape the violence. Protecting children is key to preventing the violence experienced by and perpetuated against women in adulthood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the work that has gone into the Australian government's 10-year National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children, released on 17 October this year. This plan is the national policy framework that will guide the government's actions over the next decade to eliminate violence against women and their children. I am proud to be part of a government that has committed $1.7 billion to fighting gender based violence in our recent budget. We heard Senator Gallagher outline some of those initiatives in question time, but government alone cannot fix this problem, so I encourage everyone in the community to work together to end gender based violence. We have to do this because, as we have heard, one death is one death too many.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  I would like to again congratulate the government on the new National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children and I acknowledge the work of the former government on this too. I thank the many members of this Senate who have worked tirelessly on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One in six women in Australia have experienced physical and/or sexual violence. The elimination of violence against women and children before 2032 is a bold plan. This work and this cultural change are clearly urgent. The target is very ambitious, and the achievement of this target is contingent on a cultural shift, a mindset shift, amongst Australians. This shift requires individuals, families and communities across Australia to challenge much of our ingrained patriarchal thinking that normalises male domination and power. It requires us to rethink the normalcy of violent actions which are so prevalent in our modern society. This is uncomfortable and challenging work, but we all stand to gain from this. It's an uncomfortable thing to challenge our ingrained attitudes—things that we learn growing up and just take as the way things are. Cultural change is hard, but it can be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard much about toxic masculinity. I have a concern that this is not often the most helpful way to talk about it to drive change. As the late author bell hooks put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The crisis facing men is not the crisis of masculinity, it is the crisis of patriarchal masculinity. Until we make this distinction clear, men will continue to fear that any critique of patriarchy represents a threat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, this is something we as men need to be able to talk about more. Violence against women needs to become a men's issue. We all need to stand up on this issue, and we all stand to gain as we are part of this shift in thinking and our culture. Clearly, this is up to all of us, not just women. We need men to stand up and speak out, to call out sexism, to have the difficult conversations with our friends in our peer groups about the things that we've learnt—about what it means to be a man and to allow ourselves to be vulnerable, to seek help and support when we need it, rather than believing that to be a man is to be tough and not show weakness. This shift needs to come from every person in Australia, regardless of gender and age. We all have a role to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is a fitting time to be talking about this, ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women tomorrow. I'd like to note that, to mark this day, the Zonta Club of Canberra will be lighting Canberra orange. This is something Zonta do each year as part of their 16 days of activism to keep raising attention to this matter. The Malcolm Fraser Bridge will glow, so too will each of our light-rail stops, the National Carillon and, importantly, this building, which is a focal point of both Canberra and the nation, in recognition of the decisions that get made here on behalf of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that this small gesture at Parliament House, supporting Zonta and their efforts, goes some way to highlighting the support and the work that is being done across parliament to further this issue. I invite senators who will be in Canberra tomorrow night to come and speak with Zonta at 7.30, just after the sun sets, out the front of Parliament House. For those who can't make it, we all have a role to play in this: start to have those conversations; start to speak to loved ones and to friends about how we shift this. It is an ambitious plan. It is a worthy goal. It is something that is possible. There are so many people who have dedicated their lives and are working tirelessly to make this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to finish, I want to give a shout-out to some of our local organisations who are working on the front line here in the ACT dealing with the impacts of domestic and family violence every day. That includes the YWCA, the DVCS, and the Beryl and Doris women's refuges. I thank you for all you do for our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I would like to express my support for the government leading the next National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children, and I'd also like to begin by recognising the work of my own mother, the first Warlpiri speaking, the first language speaking, minister in the Northern Territory government, of the former Country Liberal Party, Bess Nungarrayi Price. She was integral in the establishment of the very first national action plan to reduce domestic violence, and she worked closely with my now colleague Senator Michaelia Cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very difficult for her, but this is an issue that is very close to our hearts, both my mother and I being survivors. We have also seen violence played out within our immediate family over the years and have experienced the challenges of being Aboriginal women in a traditional Aboriginal context. We talk about culture, and today we are bringing to light the traditional cultural impacts that immediately affect our family. When I hear my colleagues speak of the rates of violence against Aboriginal women in this country, they're speaking about the women in my family. There's a lack of understanding or want of understanding to understand those cultural impacts of when young girls are promised to older men and are forced to be in outstations, where, like my aunt, they go missing for decades. They are forced into those circumstances. When these circumstances are supported by family members, it makes it even it harder for Aboriginal women. It makes it harder when Aboriginal women try to get up and talk about these circumstances and we're immediately affected by our own traditional culture. Others call you a sellout; others call you many different names but don't want to recognise the pressures that we come under as those who live under the confines of traditional Aboriginal culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were to address this correctly, we would see rates of incarceration drop dramatically. We would see children being able to live in homes free of violence. We would start to see the sort of equality that we want in this country if we could actually recognise those elements that are most destructive, those elements that have taken away the lives of many of my family members, those elements that led to the death of Candy Napaljarri; Marion Napurrurla, her daughter; Kayleen Nungarrayi, another mother to me; Linda Nangala, my niece, who was stabbed in a town camp and killed, who left two children behind; Rita Penangke, my aunt, who left my little cousin behind; Rosalie Nungarrayi, my mother's sister, who was stabbed and killed in a town camp in Katherine; Caroline Napaljarri, my cousin; and, Stephanie Napaljarri, my cousin whose body I had to ID in a morgue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious in this nation about lowering the rates of domestic violence for Aboriginal women, we have to listen to the voices of the women who are prepared to speak up. One of those voices is Cheron Long, who I brought to this parliament last year, and her sister, Meescha. Her sister was found hanged from a boab tree in a Territory community, but they believe she was murdered. The investigation didn't find that. These are injustices that need to be followed up in this country. These voices, those ones that are rarely heard, need to be heard in this conversation. Otherwise, we'll continue to see the rates of deaths of Indigenous women remain at critically high levels. These deaths are due to family and domestic violence and sexual abuse that are experienced in places that are out of sight and out of mind to the rest of this country. It must be understood. We talk about culture and toxic masculinity. It occurs in traditional Aboriginal culture as well. I know because my family have been subjected to it, and we need to start taking this seriously.</span>

First Nations women are the backbone of our communities—strong, staunch and loyal. Our women care and fight for country, keep our families together and keep our communities grounded and strong. First Nations women bear the brunt of colonisation in a way like no other. We face a greater risk of domestic and family violence in this country. The statistics paint a heartbreaking image.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I see the statistics, I think of the physical violence, the broken teeth, the bruised black bodies and the sexual violence and harassment. I think of those calls all black women know too well, of our sister girls wailing down the other end of the phone. I think of the mattress coming into the lounge room, for the woman who is now homeless. I think of our women being demonised by child protection services. I think of our babies being removed, torn from their mothers' arms. I think of the police not viewing us as the 'right type' of domestic violence victim. And I think of our women sitting in intimidating courtrooms, seeking safety from the same system that on every other day is violent and unjust towards our black bodies. We know that violence against our women continues after the assault, through systemic racism. Domestic violence is crippling for all victims-survivors, and I acknowledge this. The sad reality is that our voices, our pain and our solutions are not heard or taken as seriously as those of white women.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a holistic approach that addresses not only the immediate problem we face but also the historic, political and socioeconomic factors which we did not cause but which contribute to this violence.

Our leadership will only strengthen this country for all.</span>

This is urgent and overdue. We need to work together to make it happen. Today and every day I will fight for the lives of black women in this country. I will not allow our pain, our struggle and our survival to go by the wayside.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Senators, we are at our best when we speak from the heart and we speak about domestic violence. I want to say how moved I've been today by the contributions thus far about one of the most uncomfortable of topics. It is, in fact, one of the most important topics, where we can actually demonstrate to the community that it is a topic that affects each and every one of us in our communities, because there's no discrimination when it comes to domestic violence, and if you've never walked the walk, it's not so easy to talk the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in our society need to educate the men and the women, the girls and the boys about respect—and respect for one another. That's why I'm proud to be in the Senate today: it does demonstrate that, as senators, we can be respectful to each other and listen to one another when we're talking about a topic that has touched too many of us and our families. In Australia, on average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner. One in three Australian women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by a man they know. One in four Australian women have experienced physical or sexual violence perpetrated by a current or former intimate partner since age 15.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women aims to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls around the world. But we in our own communities should be the leaders. We should speak up. As many here have acknowledged, community leaders and people in this place, the other place and state parliaments have the aim, as one of their main aims as public figures, of changing the attitudes of too many who turn a blind eye to what is happening to their neighbours and families and, in fact, what is happening in their own homes. We need to be open. We need to show compassion in relation to domestic violence. Too often, when a woman is in a violent situation, people ask, 'Why doesn't she just leave?' What we should be asking is, 'Who could she turn to and where will she go?' We need to remove the burden from victims and provide an opportunity for them to have a safe place to land. It takes enormous courage for a woman to pack up her children and leave a violent situation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of the Albanese Labor government because we are acting, and I know from the debate today that we have the support of those who have spoken and those who won't get the opportunity to speak today. Women who escape this violent, intense situation need to have somewhere to go. We need to provide affordable housing for these women and children. If you're a child raised in a home where there is domestic violence and coercion, you're more likely to stay in that type of relationship in adulthood. We must break down the barriers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been fantastic to have some of our male senators make a contribution today and to hear that they have been educated by not only women in this chamber but also in the other place and by leaders in our community. It's a huge task and we know it's huge, but we have to start. Domestic violence is everyone's business, not just those in this chamber. It's not the police force that has to enforce the law. It is the responsibility of all of us. That's why we have to encourage men in the community to step in and tell their mates: 'That's enough. You're going too far.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever circumstances you're in, every young girl, every young boy, every male and every female deserves to be treated with respect and protected from any type of violence in this country—because one death is one too many. </span>

This is a very important day not just here but across Australia and our region. I want to record the strong support of the opposition, in this place, for the statement and initiative of this debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our focus as a government on women's safety was a strong one, as demonstrated in the budget of 2022-23. We clearly said that we wanted to create an Australia that is free from violence against women and children, and where women are safe and respected, by focusing on the four pillars of prevention, early intervention, response and recovery. Our policies and funding followed that focus. We had a specific Minister for Women's Safety in our government. My friend and colleague Senator the Hon. Anne Ruston is unable to be here this afternoon and I want to acknowledge her contribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the extraordinary privilege of hosting, chairing perhaps, a significant number of women's roundtables in my previous ministerial role. They were held in Australian capital cities and regional areas across the states and territories, some of them forced online by the invidious nature of COVID. It was an extraordinary privilege to hear dozens and dozens of Australian women. These were immensely powerful opportunities for them to share their views and experiences from vastly different walks of life across our country. More times than I care to remember, disclosures were made, at those roundtables, of individual and family experiences and, inevitably, sometimes for the first time. Everybody would stop in their tracks and realise that we all know someone who has experienced family and domestic violence in their lives. For many, that is a confronting fact to accept. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is an opportunity for me to thank the people who participated in those roundtables, who were so open and frank with us, who challenged me and those who attended. It's also an opportunity to thank those who work to support women and their children across Australia and victims-survivors across this country, as Senator David Pocock did in his remarks. I also thank the many frontline workers and organisations that do everything and anything they can to support and protect women and their children and to prevent violence. Many of us here work with them and support them in our communities. Their work is often not acknowledged, and I want to do that now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across New South Wales and as a minister, I have met so many people whose lives are committed to this issue. I know Patty Kinnersly and Moo Baulch were here in parliament this week, and I want to acknowledge them and their work with Our Watch and the previous chair, Natasha Stott Despoja, for what they do. I want to acknowledge ANROWS for their vital research and I want to acknowledge the refuges that exist across our communities to protect women who have nowhere else to go. In New South Wales and perhaps elsewhere—I'm not sure how far they have spread—there's the organisation Women's Community Shelters, the initiative of Annabelle Daniel and so many others, including people like Yvonne Keane in Western Sydney. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are refuges like The Haven in Penrith, such an important service in our community. I acknowledge one member of the board, my very good friend who is actually the mayor of Penrith, Tricia Hitchen. She has gone from police inspector in Western Sydney to a board member of a refuge. She has gone from pursuing perpetrators to ensure that they paid the price for their attacks on vulnerable women and children to being able to support women and children who have nowhere else to go. Tricia doesn't turn a hair at the thought that she needs to pick up the toilet paper supplies, the cereal or whatever it might on any day be for The Haven. That is nothing to her because it delivers for those women and children, and I'm immensely proud of what she does in my community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As human services minister I initiated a program in the Department of Human Services in relation to the prevention of family and domestic violence and support for victims and perpetrators, called Enough. I was very proud of that. At the moment I'm the deputy chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Parliamentary Standards, and I serve on that committee with my colleagues Senator Chandler, Nola Marino and others. The committee is chaired by Sharon Claydon. After we finish with our parliamentary standards report, I want to make sure that we take steps to address support for people in this place that experience family and domestic violence: the workers, the staff, the contractors and others. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  The 16 days of activism against gender based violence is an annual international campaign that starts on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Violence against women does not happen in a vacuum; it is most often perpetrated by men, and it is time to seriously reckon with that fact and how we change it. A whole-of-society approach that tackles the root cause of the problem that is patriarchy and the power imbalance it creates is really the way forward. This means recognising the systemic ways that women's inequality is linked to violence and how violence and abuse is sustained through this inequality. Women continue to be underemployed and underpaid and they represent the vast majority of workers in precarious and undervalued work, such as in the care economy. Violence against women is preventable, and greater gender equity is at the heart of the solution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that First Nations women as well as women of colour are far more likely to face domestic and family violence. The fact is that Aboriginal women and women of colour also face many extra barriers trying to access services. Systemic racism is part and parcel of our institutions, such as health, law enforcement and justice. There is a complete and utter lack of investment in Aboriginal community controlled organisations that specialise in providing culturally safe family violence services. Similarly, there are very few services funded especially for women of colour or trans women or women with disability. This is an unacceptable situation. We know that family violence increased during COVID, but let's be frank here, let's look at the truth: violence against women was at epidemic levels in this country even before the pandemic began, and the lack of support services and women's refuges has meant that women have always been trapped in homes with their abusers because they simply have nowhere to go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year we count the numbers and every year they are distressingly high. Politicians in this place on days like today say how shocked they are and how terrible it is, yet governments are still unwilling to take the necessary steps and to invest at the large scale needed to tackle violence and abuse. Counting Dead Women Australia—who have taken on the heartbreaking and difficult work of doing just that: counting how many women we lose to violence every year—say that, as of this week, we have lost 40 women in Australia this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A case that really broke my heart is that of Arnima Hayat, a 19-year-old medical student who was found dead in a bathtub full of acid in her North Parramatta home in early February. Her new husband was later charged with murder after handing himself in. Her young life was cut short. Her family said she'd aspired to be a surgeon. Arnima was just a teenager.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This story, and others like it, can't be 'just another story', and then we move on. We know what needs to be done and we must do it now. We know that at the heart of violence against women is control, misogyny and sexism and a culture that continues to endorse these. This kind of violence happens repeatedly because there are apologists for toxic masculinity in society. It's plainly and painfully obvious that we need to do much more. Governments need to do more; society needs to do more. Victims-survivors who do reach out rely on a system that is desperately underfunded and overstretched. There is a dangerous shortage of services for survivors of domestic violence all over the country. When women, some with children in tow, have taken the brave step to walk away from violence, there is nowhere to go—no safe place to go to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our goal should be to prevent and end domestic violence. To do that, we can't have bandaid solutions. It can't be one size fits all or something based on administrative rationalism. It has to be holistic—an all-encompassing approach that actually changes culture and systems, at the same time as it provides the best possible care and services for victims and survivors.</span>

Violence against women—the violence so regularly perpetrated against women and girls—is an issue for you. It affects women, sure—in small ways and in big ways. Sometimes it's the immediate trauma; sometimes it reverberates in the months and years to follow. It does affect women, sure. But it is perpetrated by men against women and girls. Of course it's a human rights issue. It really is, though, I think, a men's issue. It is men who perpetrate the violence, after all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should women and girls bear the burden of dealing with the violence that is perpetrated against them? Individual women and girls bear that burden, of course, when they speak up about the violence that is perpetrated against them, or against their friends or their daughters; when they speak to the police, or to their parents; or when they go through the long and difficult, unlikely and often fruitless process of seeking justice or just trying to stop it happening again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine then—consider, for a moment—the courage and determination of young women like Chanel Contos or Saxon Mullins. What courage, what determination, what decency—to put aside their own interests, to put themselves into the public, in the interests of all Australian women and girls. And the hundreds of young women with whom they spoke, who spoke up themselves to policymakers about their experience—that, I think, is real courage. We should celebrate their courage, their resilience and the dignity with which they spoke. And we should listen.</span>

It's violence perpetrated against them at home, at work, at school, at university, at their friends' homes—in so many public and private settings. Mostly what men should do is listen, reflect, act and lead, because the burden of acting on violence against women should fall on men—all of us. If so many women are the victims of intimate-partner violence or of sexual assaults in the home, in social settings or in public or if they are subjected to sexual harassment at work, then an awful lot of men are engaged in violence. That means that the problem is wide and deep in Australian culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From brutal, catastrophic assaults to the accumulation of small, daily, physical or verbal assaults and intimidations that leach the joy and confidence away from so many women—it's the boys at high school, the men at the pub or the club or the BBQ, the male students and lecturers at uni or TAFE, the workmates and the supervisors who need to show the same courage and the same decency that all those women like Ms Mullins and Ms Contos have shown to stand up to take the wind out of the sails of men who say things that denigrate women, make light of violence or commit violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Culture is critical. It doesn't remove individual responsibility or agency, but leadership matters and so does culture and behaviour at work, school, uni and TAFE. Workplace sexual harassment is violence perpetrated against women in their workplace. Again, it's women who have provided leadership here. I saw that the Attorney-General made some appointments today to the Respect@Work Council, and I want to recognise some of the women who I know who have been appointed to that council. I congratulate everyone who has been appointed to that council, but Emeline Gaske, Julia Fox, Jo Schofield, Mel Donnelly and Abbey Kendall are women in the trade union movement who have led the fight against sexual harassment in the workplace. I congratulate them in anticipation of all the leadership that they are going to show again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence against women and girls happens everywhere—in families, at school, at work, in political parties and parliaments, in the street, in our clubs, in our organisations and in our unions. When men see it, they must act. Call out thuggishness, violence, misogyny, whether it is deliberate and calculated or careless or reckless. That's my message to men and boys. Stand up with the courage of the women and girls in our lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is one day, we have to find in this place a way to make it every single day that we stand up in this place, lead by example and do everything we can to eliminate violence against women. This unites us as women, as senators and as human beings. All of us in this place know somebody who is the victim of coercion, domestic violence, physical violence or sexual violence, and some, as we heard so poignantly, have multiple members, in the case of Senator Nampijinpa Price, whose female relatives and friends have been murdered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all need to stand up and say very clearly that there is no such thing as family violence and there is no such thing as domestic abuse. It is violence, it is murder and it is a crime. The diminishing of this as family violence or as things that are acceptable to remain hidden in plain sight, behind closed doors, has to end. We are in such a great position to do that because it does unite each and every one of us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very, very proud to be a member of the cabinet task force on women's safety and economic security with my other cabinet colleagues who put so much work and passion into the women's budget statements and into the many programs that we initiated with great passion for women's safety and women's economic security, because there can be no safety without economic security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, and I think we all know here today, that no matter how many policies you have and how much money we throw at this issue—as important as both those things are—nothing will change if we do not change the attitudes of all Australians. Fifty per cent of Australians don't know what to look for, they don't know what it looks like and they certainly do not know how to call it out. Not only do we have the responsibility to set the example here—to make sure we support the best possible budget statements, the best possible policies and the government of the day to implement them—but we also have to do more in our own communities and in our own families to call it out for what it is. Whether you are in an Aboriginal community in Alice Springs, or our neighbours next door, this is happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quote the United Nations Secretary General, who said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How right he is, because this is not just an issue for women in other nations; it is as much of a problem in our own societies, as much as we try not to accept that this is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating breaches of human rights in our own nation. Clearly, this is a problem for us as much as it is for anywhere else, whether it's in this nation that you are vulnerable, or overseas, whether from war, famine or the many other factors that make people vulnerable—you can be just as vulnerable in the house next door to us in all of our suburbs all around our nation. Having a look at this and accepting that this is a problem for us, and having so many men in this chamber today calling it out, is a great, great next step. Let's do what we can in this place on a multipartisan basis to make every single day a day where we work together to eliminate violence in all its forms against women and girls.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deput</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">y Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  Violence against women and children is not inevitable. It does not have to be the standard we set for ourselves as a nation. It does not have to take the toll that it does on women and children in our world. Too many women and children experience gender based violence. I have experienced it as a child, and I know the lifelong psychological damage that it can do. We know that one woman dies every 10 days at the hands of her former or current partner. Thirty per cent of women have experienced violence by a partner, another known person or a stranger since the age of 15. We all know it needs to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that we need to talk deeply about these issues. People say it is a crime—yes, it is a crime, but not every child will want to send their father to jail, for example. It's really important that we know how to stop this abuse while supporting families, whether they choose to stay together or separate through that journey in a way that keeps everybody safe. Every Australian should have the right to live a life free from violence. I'm proud of what our government is doing in partnership with state and territory governments, and that is indeed about addressing underlying factors that drive gender based violence—underlying factors that we can change, and that relate to cultural and gender norms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that men experience gender based violence, too. They can experience family and domestic violence, but it doesn't happen at the same rate as it does to women. One in 13 men have experienced this, according to the data. I recognise that there may be more men in this context. But it does not detract from the fact that it is often gender norms that underlie the nature of gender based domestic violence and are part of generating that violence to start with. When we have debates in this chamber where we talk about violence against men being under-recognised and do it in a way that exacerbates restrictive gender norms and continues to put people in very, very narrow boxes, we're not going to fix anyone's domestic or gender based violence issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context of addressing these issues of family and domestic violence, we can talk about ending violence against women and children, but that is not to make it as if we are deprioritising men. When we value people's ability to live freely, to express their gender identity, to exhibit feminine characteristics without being seen as weak—we know, for example, that men don't speak up about violence because it can be seen as a weakness—and when we liberate ourselves from restrictive notions of gender and who is safe and who is not and how and why, we can recognise where gender based violence comes from. We know, of course, that women and children are more likely to experience domestic violence, and that is because of the shape of those gender norms that can make men victims too. In this context, it's really important we have a strong national plan that unpacks cultural factors as well as practical ones: housing to flee violence, new frontline workers, positive duties on employers— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I thank the Senate and I thank all colleagues for their contributions to this debate today. I especially want to thank those senators who have suffered violence for sharing their very powerful stories. It has been a difficult debate to sit here and listen to, as someone who has experienced family violence, but it's an important debate. Sometimes, when senators and MPs bear too much of ourselves for the sake of breaking the convention of speeches in this place that are very matter of fact, we can often feel like we've said too much. This is a debate when not enough can be said, and not enough can be said from personal reflections. It supports and helps women in the community to hear these very personal and deeply powerful stories being told here in our most powerful place. There are women on every side of this chamber who can speak from personal experience, and that speaks to the prevalence of this issue in our society. It's a sad state of affairs, but it's a situation that allows us to talk frankly and quite personally today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very thankful for the work that has been undertaken by senators in this chamber over many years, and I do want to acknowledge that work. There have been calls for funding strategies and efforts to highlight the importance of this issue. Perhaps one piece of this puzzle seems insignificant against the huge, insurmountable problem we face, but I think when you put those things together they actually have delivered strategies that can work and a discussion in this country that has changed. So I thank Senator Waters for her continued support of women and for always making sure that this is on the agenda. I thank Senator Payne, who worked very hard in the previous parliament; Senator McAllister obviously, my friend, who always gives me a pat on the back after these speeches; and Senator Gallagher, our current Minister for Women. When I was growing up and I didn't really know much about politics I knew that Senator Gallagher was a boss and I knew that she was the kind of woman that would get things done. I'm really pleased and proud that she is our Minister for Women. I know she really cares about this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank those women and the chamber for this discussion today. I also want to thank one of the women who are here in the chamber today—Helena Brunker. She is an ANU intern. She has been working in my office on some work around the operation and efficacy of Australian consent laws, which is part of the discussion that we need to have around ending gender based violence in this country. It's really tough work. For such a young woman she has taken on this work with skill and without being daunted by the task ahead of her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contributing to this debate today I want to speak to Helena, her friends and her generation and to acknowledge that this is an opportunity for us to talk about the work that we're doing and the work we've done. I'd like to think that when your generation gets the opportunity to sit in these seats we're not talking about this issue in the same way anymore and we're not talking about these things from personal experience, because we've put an end to domestic violence, to gender based violence and to sexual assault that isn't able to be rectified through any form of justice for victims. That's a tall ask, but we take that on. We thank you and your generation for giving us something to work towards and giving us something to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I thank my family. My mum doesn't talk very much about this issue and about the past, but she is very special to me. I thank her.</span>

We have heard today about its prevalence; this issue touches every woman, every family and every community across Australia. Before I entered this place I worked in the family and domestic violence sector for nearly two decades. It's something that I have spoken about at length, written about and researched. I have worked in frontline services, with the police and in refuges. I have packed Christmas gifts and put teddy bears on the beds of kids in refuges. Those kids had been separated because of violence that had happened in their household. It is heartbreaking when you have to do that work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night I had the pleasure of attending the Our Watch event held here at Parliament House. I acknowledge my colleague Senator Waters, the Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate, for her work on the parliamentary friends group alongside Bridget Archer and Alicia Payne. I had a great time catching up with colleagues and reflecting on the time that I was on the Our Watch board. Before this I also worked with then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to develop the blueprint to the first national plan in this country. I was the only First Nations woman on that committee. I was a lone voice speaking to the Prime Minister. I also want to acknowledge the work of the then Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, who's part of the Labor Party. During that time, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Time </span><span style="font-style:italic;">for action</span> report was handed down in this place. I was honoured to be part of some of those key recommendations that recommended Our Watch and ANROWS, as Senator Payne reflected, as being developed during that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night was a reflection of how far those organisations have come, when I hear about the work that they've done in this space, but also how far we have to go. When I think about the prevalence and I think about the stories and I think about all of the things that are still happening across Australia, I know that there is so much work for us to do collectively, especially in regard to violence against First Nations women and their children.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw the recent announcement of the government's ambitious plan to end violence against women in a generation. A key part of that was the standalone plan. I have relentlessly advocated for a standalone plan for more than a decade, and I'm glad to see this government taking it on board. It's a plan that has got to be created by mob for mob, and it has to be designed to give communities the support they need and to take into consideration some of those cultural factors that are unique and solutions that are unique, in fact, across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 46th Parliament I co-signed a motion, alongside Senator Thorpe, to trigger an inquiry into missing and murdered First Nations women and children in this country. Tomorrow it will commemorate its one-year anniversary. I'm really proud to say that Senator Green and Senator Scarr, in their stewardship of the Senate committee, have been very mindful of the issues and the stories that will be told in this committee. We know the unacceptable rates for First Nations women compared to non First Nations women. They are up to 12 times more likely to be murdered. I want to acknowledge also the other First Nations senators in this place and the other place, who have those stories, as well, that reverberate across our families and communities. These are unacceptable and disproportional rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of numbers, we know that far too many of our women are dying and that not enough is being done to stop this from happening. It's no surprise to those who have worked in this area, who have been affected by it, that this hurt, this grief and this trauma are still reverberating across our communities. The truth is we still don't know the true extent of that, and that's because some of these cases are unreported and the data is inconsistent. In fact, even today the media didn't show up to talk about the inquiry. That's telling. That's why we're having this inquiry in the first place. We sent out a media alert and asked them to come, and they didn't turn up. We see the <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> coverage and we see the vigils and the rallies, but we also hear the reverberating silence. In the next 16 days I want everyone to remember that as we move forward it's about action. Your activism matters, and here in the federal parliament is where it starts. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  This Friday 25 November marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It starts the global 16 days of activism against gender based violence, which concludes on 10 December, international Human Rights Day. Around the world, there has been an explosion of activism responding to violence against women and girls. Since the Me Too movement gained international attention five years ago, the momentum has continued. I want to acknowledge the ongoing grassroots activism from women defending their own human rights, whether it's here in Australia with women such as the formidable Grace Tame or elsewhere across the world, such as with the women in Iran. It is important for us to acknowledge one of the most widespread human rights abuses in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade subcommittee on human rights. In light of the recent inquiry into rights of women and children, yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting Emma Macey-Storch, the director and producer of a documentary called <span style="font-style:italic;">Geeta</span>. This film, set in the urban slums of Agra in India, tells the story of Geeta Mahor, a mother of three daughters, whose husband tried to kill her and her daughters in their sleep by maliciously throwing acid on them. The incident resulted in Geeta being badly injured. The two daughters were severely scarred, and the baby, tragically, passed away. The reason for this atrocious act of violence stemmed from the husband's frustration of having three daughters and no sons, but no reason will ever warrant or justify domestic and family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite permanent disfigurement caused by the burns, Geeta and her daughters have become loud activists, calling for an end to gender based violence and criminalising acid attacks. Geeta's story shows the power of everyday heroism that creates grassroots change, change we desperately need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worldwide, one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence, mostly by an intimate partner. In Australia, one woman dies every 10 days at the hands of her former or current partner. Family and domestic violence continues to be a scourge on our society, and we must do everything to end it. Family and domestic violence is experienced at disproportionately high rates by First Nations women, as we've heard already today; culturally and linguistically diverse women and children; people with disability; and people who identify as LGBTQI+. It is on every person to change this. We must do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only does family violence have a human cost; it has an economic cost. This issue continues to drive gender inequality in the areas of employment participation and financial security and is the leading cause of homelessness in women and children. In WA, taking inspiration from the global 16 days of activism, we have the 16 Days in WA campaign. Western Australians are encouraged to create change to educate, motivate and advocate in their own communities and stand up to stop violence against women. I want to acknowledge the tireless work of WA Minister for the Prevention of Family and Domestic Violence, Simone McGurk. She's an incredible leader for my home state on this issue, but this work is not for any one minister or person; it is a shared mission. It is everybody's responsibility and everybody's business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the federal level we have a lot of work to do in this space, but we have started. I'm proud to be part of the Albanese Labor government, as we have legislated to provide 10 days of paid family domestic violence leave. Economic security is a key factor determining whether a person can escape a violent relationship, so this will save lives. We all need to stand up and do our bit, because ending violence against women is everybody's business. I commend every senator, every colleague, in this chamber for their efforts and contributions today. On this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women we need to work together to ensure a safer Australia for all.</span>

There is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women—we know what has happened is horrific: the death of women and the impost it has had on children—but, as I keep saying all the time, it's also about domestic violence against men. I've been listening to the speeches here in this chamber and I have not heard anyone refer to the domestic violence that is carried out against men. Twenty-five per cent of domestic violence in this country is attributed to women. If you want to stamp out domestic violence, you must speak about it truthfully, instead of coming in here and beating your chest about it. I've spoken about domestic violence. I never grew up with domestic violence in my own household—I was very, very fortunate—but I had a husband who was domestically violent, so I know what it's about.

This is not what you should be pushing. Push right across the board and look at the problems that we have. If you look at our Family Court system, that's where a lot of problems are happening, because men—and some women—are absolutely frustrated that they don't have the opportunity to spend time with their children. They are denied that right. If you go to the guts of the problem, you will solve a lot of the problems. If you deal with the family law courts issues and then allow parents to see their children, you might stop half the problems that are going on. It is a very important issue.</span>

Therefore, you've taken away from that time. Why? It was because you didn't want debate on the Voice to Parliament. We are here discussing this because you didn't want it to go to the vote, so you denied me the right to put that up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you need to address domestic violence and acknowledge that it is also women that are murdering men. It is women who are responsible for a lot of the problems as well. You need to address the problem and ask why it is happening. Don't go around beating your chest here and saying, 'Well, how are you going to deal with it?' I've just told you: the biggest problem is coming from the family law courts. Start addressing those problems in the family law courts and let parents be parents to their children. You'll get rid of a lot of the angst that is happening. There are fathers who go through it; they're thrown out of their homes with their children. The fact is that there's nowhere for them to go. I've championed that fact and pushed for them. They must be looked after as well, so that they have refuge and can get the assistance and help that they need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's all about women. Yes, men are the main perpetrators, but they are not the sole perpetrators. What about the woman who threw cooking oil all over her husband or the woman who stabbed her husband to death? Don't you care about that? What about the women who try to run over their husbands? Don't you care about that? They are still people who need fair representation across the board and who need to have it discussed in a fair and honest way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that needs to be addressed is parental alienation; that is not being addressed either. Until we address that, you're going to have domestic violence. I'll be honest with you—I'll tell you what happened. My husband was giving me a hard time. I cooked dinner for him and said, 'Your dinner is ready.' He never came up for his dinner, so I took it down after saying it a third time. He was standing across the pool table, and I said, 'Your dinner is ready.' He said, 'I'll come up when I'm ready.' You know what? I said, 'You're ready now,' and threw that plate full of dinner across the table at him, and it smashed against the wall. So I admit to the fact that you can both have your agreements and disagreements and get into arguments and debates in the household. Don't make out that it's just purely men who are responsible for this, because women can instigate it and cause problems in the household as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sheer fact is: don't put up ads that say men should get counselling to do with domestic violence. Women need to be told where to go too, because women are responsible and can instigate domestic violence in the household. But let's look at it fairly, right across the board, and treat everyone equally, rather than by what sex you are. It's alright to call a person a woman now when you're talking on this topic, but any other time there's no male or female. It's like we don't have a sex or an identity. You use the sex when it suits you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I was saying earlier that I can't support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022 because it is again the Albanese government rejecting rural and regional Australia. I was talking about what we did in government and our Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy. We also committed $2.1 billion to help increase the uptake of low- and zero-emission vehicle technologies, and market movements were happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an uptake of electric vehicles, and the range and choice of suitable cars is widening. Tomorrow, thanks to Senator David Pocock, I am going to trial an electric ute, which will be an experience, indeed, because one of the things I hear from where I live is there are just no commercially available electric utes or decent farm vehicles yet. Given that, and given technology is advancing, the market is actually determining it, why is the government deciding it needs to interfere in the market? For what purpose?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent Parliamentary Budget Office have reported that this bill will cost billions of dollars through the next decade. To back up that conclusion, Treasury is not even able to articulate the long-term costs of the measure. It's billions of dollars in unnecessarily forgone revenue, helping the elite, when we face massive infrastructure rebuilds because of the floods that have gone on now, with massive ongoing and extensive natural disaster repairs to our roads network. These electric vehicles will contribute nothing to general revenue because they don't pay fuel excise. It's billions of dollars in lost revenue which could have alternatively been put towards hospitals, more regional doctors, more regional teachers and more support for small businesses—but, no. The government are trying to convince Australians that they are strong, fiscal managers. This bill shows they are not. This bill is a typical example of the government's usual modus operandi, their grab for votes, irrespective of the benefits or the consequences of their too-little-thought-through policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the independent Parliamentary Budget Office that thought it an unsound idea. Despite being called 'tax reform' by the Treasurer, the Senate inquiry held into this legislation showed it to be high-cost, low-impact and designed with no consultation with industry, government or civil society. A number of experts have actually raised serious questions about the equity, fiscal sustainability and price pressures this will place on the EV market. Professor Miranda Stewart, Director of the Tax Group at the University of Melbourne Law School and fellow at the Tax and Transfer Policy Institute at the Crawford School of Public Policy, is quoted as saying the policy will deliver subsidy to 'a rather narrow class of employee beneficiaries and provides the largest benefit to the highest income earners'. Guess what? They don't live in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does not line up with the government's sensible economic policy and fiscal repair promises that they had prior to the election. The Treasurer said in June:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Government must make the hard decisions necessary for responsible budget repair.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we buying votes through subsidising electric vehicles for those who can already afford them, those who are getting a salary-sacrifice benefit? The government can't say what this bill will actually do for emissions reduction, as I said earlier. If you plug your car in overnight to recharge, chances are you are plugged into the grid and you're burning coal. They can't say what this bill will do to the EV market and they can't even say how they would assess whether it is a success or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best thing the government could do is scrap this bill, take the revenue that they would achieve through the ongoing fringe benefit tax and invest in practical measures that would actually drive investment into EV infrastructure, which would by its own measure lead to market change, lead to behavioural change and see more people take up the opportunity to drive electric vehicles. As I said at the outset, we on this side are not anti electric vehicles, are not anti electric and are not anti low- or zero-emissions transport, but we are pro investing in how to make it possible and not just delivering a benefit to those who actually don't need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Market pressures and technology advances are driving and will continue to drive wider uptake of electric vehicles. We will soon see the day when we do get long-distance trucks, cars, utes, farm vehicles and indeed even electric vehicles capable of towing trailers and caravans, as Senator O'Sullivan talked about in his earlier speech, and we will see vehicles that will be able to travel the hundreds of kilometres that I indeed do just to get to work here in Canberra before needing to recharge. But that is where we are moving to. Making current electric vehicles cheaper for a narrow, privileged few will not make that happen, so I cannot support this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia I speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. The history of climate change and related energy bills is replete with terrible governance, shoddy governance and deceitful governance. There have been genuine errors made, there have been decisions taken on greed and self-interest, contradicting the science, and now we have inappropriate market manipulation from a cynical, meddling government. This bill is designed to force the uptake of electric vehicles. What hubris, what deceit—and who pays? As always, the people are paying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can the Albanese government ignore the critical shortage of minerals essential to producing this many electric vehicles? Lithium has been a global arms race fought between electric vehicles and Labor's other loves: batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. There's not enough lithium on earth for one of these follies, let alone all four. Stuart Crow, chair of Lake Resources, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There simply isn't going to be enough lithium on the face of the planet, regardless of who expands and who delivers, it just won't be there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what's the government's plan to handle the lithium shortage in the electronics industry as net zero sucks up supply of cobalt, lithium and copper? Demand inflation will force these resources up in price over the next few years. How's the government going to explain to citizens why their phones, laptops and household goods have been made unaffordable from so-called sustainable, green technologies? By the way, have you noticed how United Nations World Economic Forum sustainability programs can exist only with subsidies, meaning they're not sustainable?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to the point, the engineering boundaries are real, and wishy-washy responses about finding new solutions don't work when the best solution, lithium, is being wasted on the vanity of net zero. Labor's much-hyped goal of net zero for 2050 will run out of charge between 2025 and 2030, when lithium supplies are predicted to dry up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This shortage is already manifested in mineral prices. In 2020 lithium was $6,000 per tonne. Today what is it? I'll tell you: it's sitting around $78,000 per tonne—13 times higher. Everything this precious resource is being wasted on will be sitting in landfill before 2050. I say it again: everything this precious resource is being wasted on will be sitting in landfill, buried before 2050. Every wind turbine, every solar panel, every big battery, every home battery—all of it rotting while the earth and its oceans are torn apart to feed the monstrous dream of net zero through the strip mining of the seabed for rare-earth minerals that are necessary for the production of these follies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even electric vehicle manufacturers admit to being in trouble. The World Economic Forum, whose policies seem to find their way into Australian legislation, thinks we need five billion electric vehicles to achieve net zero. That's not five billion through to 2050; that is five billion every five to 10 years forever. No wonder you're looking startled; this is news to most people in this room. The reason electric vehicles are so damn expensive is that, in manufacturing electric vehicles, they are resource and energy hogs. They are resource guzzlers with a huge environmental footprint, far greater than petrol and diesel cars. These price hikes, which have already started, are set to push almost all purely electric vehicles beyond the luxury car threshold required to qualify for Labor's amendment to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the amendment moved by the Greens and Senator David Pocock goes through, in 2025 hybrids will no longer be included in the bill. Price inflation will ensure not much else will be either. When President Biden gave a $7,000 subsidy, what was the first thing that happened? Car manufacturers put up their prices by $7,000. Subsidies make things dearer, not cheaper. They shift the price label but not the affordability. Perhaps some cheaper EVs that are made in China and that may or may not still be working in 2030 will benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor could, of course, raise the threshold, but at what point do we say that big business is being given a subsidy from working Australians to buy luxury vehicles? Our European friends are a decade ahead of us in this madness. They've dismissed policies like this as expensive, wasteful and counterproductive. Their conclusion is that government interference benefits rich companies at the expense of natural market competition. It's why German finance minister Christian Lindner said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We simply cannot afford misguided subsidies anymore. These cars have so far been subsidised over their lifetime with up to 20,000 euros, even for top earners. That's too much. We can save billions there, which we can use more sensibly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Germans are saying this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill for luxury foreign electric vehicles is designed to fix a number on Labor's spreadsheet of carbon dioxide output. It's not to assist a transition to electric vehicles for the general public. The fastest rise in product quality occurred when electric vehicles were forced to compete on merit against their oil and gas hydrocarbon fuelled betters. It was only then, when the customer was king, that their price came down. Their quality went up and their range increased slightly. When European governments handed the electric vehicle market billions in subsidies, car manufacturers grew fat and lazy. They took the money, slacked off on development and raised their prices knowing that public money would cover the difference. This is transferring wealth from taxpayers to electric vehicle manufacturers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's bill is more of the same failed economics that fundamentally misunderstands what drives success. Given the price dynamics at play, if anything this bill penalises full electric vehicles and preferences hybrids. At the same time hybrids begin to win the consumer war, this government's net-zero policies are pushing up the price of fuel and leaving every car owner worse off. We're quickly reaching a point where car ownership will become a rare privilege that won't impact at all anyone in this chamber, yet it will make the lives of everyday Australians an intolerable misery. As Norway, the world's premier electric vehicle buyer, has stated, they want to reduce individual car ownership and see their population walk or catch public transport. The United Nations World Economic Forum EV policy is not about having different cars; it's about no cars—no cars. Good luck telling Australian tradies that, but that's what will happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These EVs have no resale value because they tend to be sold when the batteries are cooked. If we're talking about sustainability, electric vehicles are on a swift path to landfill, unlike conventional cars that have many lives and many owners. To get electricity consumption down in order to improve range, EVs are made of composite materials, aluminium and plastics. Most of the steel in the subframe is needed to hold the extra weight of the battery. Recycling is, of course, possible, although with the price of electricity in Australia, thanks to weather-dependent solar and wind driving up power prices, our recycling industry is struggling. Think about this: much like used plastics, glass, solar panels and wind turbines, EVs will not be recycled beyond their copper wires and the little steel that has been used. If electric vehicles are a less desirable product at a terrible price heading towards extinction, what are their alleged climate virtues? Let's consider that: this virtue is not based on science; it's not a calculation of their cradle-to-grave life cycle. It's a self-declaration. Electric vehicles identify as net zero, and so this government treats them as such.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one is looking at the harm these electric vehicles cause out of sight in the Third World or asking why they still have a social licence, given that most of them source raw materials on the back of child slave labour—child slave labour. What is the environmental cost of the Third World mining operations to build a car that sits in an Australian dealership with a green virtue sticker on the side? That's completely irrelevant as far as this government is concerned. Why else would Labor throw good money after bad behind Congo cobalt? Labor are turning a blind eye to the 40,000 children in the Congo mining the cobalt for EVs—after this bill, 45,000. Leading electric vehicle manufacturers claim to be free of child slave labour, yet their supply contracts for cobalt are with companies with child slave labour in their supply chains—deceit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We like to think that our civilisation has advanced, yet these net-zero technologies, more than any other, are indulging in the cheap, largely unregulated labour of our poor neighbours and their children. When it's not children down mines clawing at the ground with their bare hands, it's the toxic mining practices for rare earths that make coalmines look like an oasis. This is the truth behind the green sticker. Electric vehicles need mining, and the Greens hate mining—or so they tell us. Greens and teals demand coal stay in the ground. How can anyone make more EVs without using coal to smelt the steel and the aluminium, process the plastics from coal and oil and make the glass? How can we make more electric vehicles without oil in the bearings? It seems the government and the Greens and teals cheer squads are determined to find out. It's impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Added to the list of disasters waiting to happen is the effect of this many electric vehicles on the national electricity grid. Now we're talking about something that's hurting everyone. All it takes is three or so electric vehicles on an average suburban street to charge at the same time, and the powerlines melt down or shut off. Weather-dependent power like solar and wind cannot charge this many electric vehicles—full stop, that's it. I'm sure this bill will lead to government departments buying another off-market round of electric vehicles to zip around Canberra. What it will not do is save the planet. What it will not do is make electric vehicles more affordable. What it will not do is ease the cost of living. What it will not do is create a better, more competitive product. And who will pay? As always, the people will pay for this government's stupidity and deceit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if they are miraculously delivered in this fit of madness, as a product electric vehicles have serious unresolved issues, like their tendency to spontaneously combust. Australia's firefighters have complained that they do not have the ability to put out lithium-ion battery fires in electric vehicles. So what happens when our underground car parks are packed full of these things and one starts off a chain reaction? What happens if they catch fire beneath apartment blocks, inside shopping centres and in tunnels? The ventilation of our buildings and car parks is not designed to handle the safety issue, the hazard and risk issue of these cars, and there will be serious accidents in tight residential areas. If there's a fire, the water used to fight that fire is 10 times the amount for a conventional car fire. Firefighters are terrified of this. Even worse, that water becomes toxic as a result of contact with a toxic battery fire and must be captured and treated. Allowing firefighting water to run off site is an environmental contamination. EV does not stand for electric vehicle; EV stands for environmental vandalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill states that its purpose is 'to encourage a greater uptake of electric cars by Australian road users to reduce Australia's carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector by making cars more affordable'. Let me be straight: this is a big-business perk to help the richest people in this country improve their environmental virtue-signalling and their social credit status on paper. It is nothing more. Labor is offering another incentive to the rich, urban, professional teal voters to come on over to Labor and to keep their buddies in government, the Greens, with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet underneath it all, the Australian people are left to pick up the bill for Labor's empty virtue-signalling and economic stupidity. This government needs to stop sucking up to the teals and start governing for Australia, and replace policies from the United Nations and World Economic Forum alliance, that began in 2018, with policies instead that serve Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention a couple of points from Judith Sloan, the economist and journalist. At a time when United Nations and World Economic Forum policies drive goals of converting our transport fleet to electricity and hugely increasing demand for electricity, our bureaucrats push United Nations and World Economic Forum policies to kill reliable, baseload coal power and replace it with expensive, intermittent, unreliable wind and solar. Judith Sloan said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is surely ironic it was Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen who explicitly outlined the numerical challenge in front of transforming the NEM in such a short time frame. He has told us we will need 22,000 solar panels every day and 40 wind turbines every month for the next eight years. There will also be a requirement for at least 10,000km of additional transmission lines.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we'll see 11,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation coming off capacity. This is insane. And who will pay? It's the people who will pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need sensible government—honest governance. We have one flag. We are one community. We are one nation. And we stand for affordable, clean, secure mobility for all Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. It probably comes as no blinding surprise to people that I'm going to speak about this from a regional perspective. But also, it's from the perspective of where I currently live. I live in Perth. Obviously, doing this job has demands in terms of travelling to Canberra and travelling around the entirety of my home state of Western Australia—which means that being relatively close to an airport is pretty essential. So I guess I do live in an inner suburb of Perth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen in our area an absolute explosion of electric cars just this year. We have seen a significant number of all models of electric car, but particularly Teslas, which are highly visible—you notice them when they're on the road. We've seen a significant uptake in people deciding, through their own purchasing decisions and looking at their own requirements for transport range, and the electrical system they have in their home in terms of being able to charge off their own solar cells—through their choice—to take up an electric car.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But one thing I can absolutely guarantee those listening to this debate and those in the chamber is that you don't see that same uptake in regional and rural Australia. And you don't see that same uptake for a pretty obvious reason: the capacity to charge and the range are simply not there. People need to be able to drive long distances, as my good friend and colleague Senator O'Sullivan pointed out. People need to be able to tow heavy weights. They need to be able to have ranges that go beyond 50, 100 or 200 kilometres. They need to be able to move around the vast state of Western Australia as they have been able to with a petrol engine car—with an internal combustion engine car—and continue to do their business and lead their lives.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see in this bill a huge shift of wealth, effectively, from outer metro and regional areas to the inner city. As I said, I do live in a relatively inner suburb and we are seeing electric cars there. So, why do we need, through this bill, to give a tax break to those inner-city people who are, quite frankly, already buying electric cars? The uptake is pretty significant. And that is coming at a direct cost—at a direct burden—to those who live in outer metropolitan regions, who have further to drive; to those who live in the regions; and to those who have a requirement to tow heavy loads. That's particularly—and obviously of interest to me—the farming community, tradies and people who work in the mining industry: people who simply don't have a choice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is highly questionable—and I'm not going to go through the technical details again; Senator O'Sullivan did a great job of going through the technical details—and it is highly unlikely, using current technology, that there will ever be a solution to towing heavy weights and having electric vehicles that can travel the long distances in rural and remote Western Australia. There could be a technological breakthrough, I have no doubt about that. But why, through this bill, are we effectively penalising those people in outer metropolitan and rural and regional Australia who simply cannot utilise electric vehicles as they currently stand, and will stand for the foreseeable future? Why are we providing a subsidy to the inner city? It really does beggar belief, particularly from a government that claims to be the defender of the working people of Australia. It absolutely beggars belief.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, I certainly won't be supporting this bill—and there are so many reasons not to support this bill. As I said, it really just represents a transfer of wealth in our society from the regions to the inner city. But it's also bad economic policy. We've got inflationary pressures in the budget, and how has the government chosen to respond? With measures such as this: measures that potentially just lead to more inflation in our economy. And will it have an impact on carbon emissions? No. Experts have said: 'It will have a negligible impact on reducing Australia's carbon emissions for the transport sector. Government's assertions that this initiative makes the take-up of EVs more affordable is misleading. Private buyers and sole traders of EVs cannot access these savings. There are other measures that would have a far greater short-term benefit for the environment than this measure.'</span>

I'm sure you could provide a tax break to horses if it was of political advantage to the Labor Party! But you choose not to. You choose to provide tax breaks to the inner-city elites. I'm sure there'd be plenty of people who'd take a tax break for horses, Senator Ayres. But instead the Labor government provides tax breaks for the inner-city elites. For those reasons, and many more, I will not be supporting the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  I too rise to speak about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. I just flag that I'll be moving a second reading amendment, to do with recycling—which is very, very important—to make sure we clean up the mess that this bill will create. I reiterate Senator Brockman's words: this is nothing but a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. Just this week the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> came out and said that this tax break could be worth up to $30,000—$30,000, for rich people who can afford to buy an electric car. And that's going to come out of general revenue, which means that the poor, the lower income earners, will have to pay more taxes, just to balance the budget. We've heard in here from Senator Wong—she's not here this afternoon, which is a shame—that renewables are cheaper. So can somebody tell me this: if renewables are cheaper, why do we need to give a tax break of up to $30,000 for every new EV that is bought? That is absolutely absurd.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you something: if you want to look after the environment, the best way to do that is to have a strongly growing economy. And there is nothing productive about giving a tax break on cars that are going to be driven around the inner city and might travel a couple of hundred kilometres if you're lucky. We're going to be having extension leads running out over footpaths and hanging up over trees. The stupidity! We've seen this in Sydney already, where people are trying to charge their cars on the street, with on-street parking. How dangerous is that? And for what? For nothing but a pipe dream.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These people want you to believe that they're struggling under global warming. We were told that yesterday by the CSIRO, who came out and said that the temperature has risen by 1.47 degrees since 1910. I must admit, when I first heard that figure quoted in question time yesterday, I nearly fell out of my chair, because, just back in 2018—and I remember these numbers, just like that—the CSIRO and BOM said that the temperature had risen by one degree. So, in 2018, in the 108 years since 1910, these guys said the temperature had risen by one degree. Now they want us to believe that it has risen by another 0.47 of a degree in just the last four years. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure it isn't hotter this year. The last two years have been cooler and wetter than the prior years, 2018 to 2020. They were quite warm years, I'll accept. But, in the last couple of years, things have actually cooled off a bit here in Australia, certainly along the east coast—and even up in Cairns.</span>

That had never happened before—people wearing jumpers at the Cairns show. Isn't that right, Senator Scarr?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to note that Senator Wong isn't here. She called me a coward yesterday, when I questioned these figures, as if to ask: who was I to question the BOM and the CSIRO? I'll tell you who I am to question the CSIRO and the BOM: I'm someone who has studied statistics in senior, at university and in my postgraduate degree. So I'm very well versed in statistics and I'm very well versed in record keeping. It is very important to note that the record keeping that the BOM undertakes is nothing to do with science; it's purely record keeping. You take a measurement, you write the number down and you store it away for posterity. You don't start creating multiple datasets—well, you're not changing the initial dataset. You create a new dataset and then you report the whole new dataset.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And you don't have to take my word for it because, back in 2011, there was an independent peer review done on the BOM's observation practices. You can look this up. It's a really important one. I haven't talked about this in years, because I've been distracted by a few other issues. Of the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network—Surface Air Temperature, or ACORN-SAT, there was an independent peer review, and I've got here the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the independent peer review panel</span>, 4 September 2011. I want to come to the key paragraph, because they do acknowledge that the Bureau of Meteorology is very good at homogenisation. Now, that is doublespeak for modelling—which is doublespeak for fudging, right? I can talk about economists; I've dealt with economists all my life. There's a big rift between accountants and economists, because we don't like modellers; we like people that measure real things. So let me take you to the key paragraph here:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There you have it, Senator Wong—I know you're not in the chamber, but if you're listening, check it out. This was the review that you commissioned—either you or Greg Combet—back in 2011 when you were the environment minister. They're not my words, they're from an independent peer review in 2011. One of the first questions I asked in estimates as a young whippersnapper back in 2019 was to the bureau on whether or not they'd reduced that margin of error—and they hadn't. Plus or minus half a degree is one degree. Minus half a degree on the low side and plus half a degree on the top side is a degree. That is exactly what they were claiming until about two years ago. The so-called increase in temperature is purely within the margin of error. I could go on, but I thought that needed to be said for the record after that imputation from Senator Wong yesterday about me being a coward. No, it's actually all written here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we need to talk about here is that somehow renewables are cheaper. I'd really like to know on what basis the Labor Party, Senator Wong and the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek—who said it earlier this week on TV—think that renewables are cheaper. That's an interesting comment to make. When I was in estimates, I asked Senator McAllister how many kilometres of transmission lines are going to have to be built to reach the 43 per cent reduction in CO2 by 2030? Lo and behold, Senator McAllister had absolutely no idea. Here is the range we were given: somewhere between 5,000 kilometres and 28,000 kilometres. Can you believe that? That is a massive range. If we had done 28,000 kilometres of ripping out scars across the beautiful countryside, farmland and native forests, is that good for the environment? I don't think so. I don't think scarring the landscape with transmission lines will be good for the environment at all. But that's not all: we'll also be getting the deaths of eaglehawks and bats. Bats, along with bees, are key pollinators of our native plants in this country, but this is in the name of reducing carbon emissions. By the way, as I said the other day, carbon dioxide is recycled naturally every four years. That's all free. That's true. If you want free energy, come back to photosynthesis. But I digress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get back to the batteries. I can tell you, if you think transmission lines, solar panels and wind turbines are going to be bad for the environment, wait until you break down the cost of what goes into building a battery. Lithium is a one per cent ore body. That means you have to mine 100 tons of the ore to get one ton of lithium. That involves an intensive electrolysis process to get the metal out of the ore. But that's not all—you can't go and get the ore body out of the ground; you have to go around and around in the big mining trucks and the caterpillars and everything else that picks up all the dirt, and cart it out. You can often have a stripping ratio of up to 10 to one, which means to get one ton of lithium metal you might have to shift a thousand tons of dirt. Guess what? That's just one of the many metals that goes into a battery. You have other things, like aluminium, steel and cobalt. And where's the world's biggest producer of cobalt? It's the Democratic Republic of the Congo. How do they get their cobalt out of the ground? That's right, child labour. Gee, that's going to be good for the environment. It's bad enough that all of these so-called renewables—which they're not, none of this stuff recycles naturally throughout the environment every four years like carbon dioxide does—but it's also a human rights issue. It's going to be bad for the children in the Congo and who knows what other countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's obviously a human rights issue here because we are transferring $30,000 every time a new car is bought from the poor to the rich, from the working class to the wealthy. That is what the Labor Party and the Greens are today—they are the parties for the inner-city, self-loathing, virtue-signalling, rent-seeking elites. That is what they are. I well remember a former Labor Prime Minister said, 'God save the Queen, because nothing will save the Governor-General.' Let me say, 'God save the King, because nothing will save the Labor Party from the working class when they have their noses driven into the grindstone by the increase in taxes and the economic pain that is going to come from higher energy prices and watching as the urban elites drive around with their electric cars while the working class are struggling in their petrol cars.' And it's not just a handout of $30,000 for a car. The working class are also going to have to pay the fuel excise. These electric cars aren't going to have any fuel excise. Are we going to have a user toll on them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, good luck to you if you're trying to actually get your car charged. I was reading an article on the weekend that someone sent to me. It said that there is now 'recharging rage' in the UK because people have to wait so long to get their cars charged. If someone accidentally bumps into the queue where others have been waiting for three hours, fights are starting at the recharging stations. It's not like with an internal combustion car—you just pull up, fill up your tank and drive away. It won't be too long before there's another bill in here where we're suddenly going to have to start building the recharging stations. I guarantee you that's what will be happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No sooner has the ink dried on the 43 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide by 2030 and what have we got? We've got another handout with the fringe benefits tax for renewable cars. It will just keep on coming. I guarantee you that the Rewiring the Nation fund of $20 billion will have to be increased. There was modelling the other day that showed that it will cost about $1 billion, or some astounding amount, for every kilometre of transmission line. It was estimated that, to rewire Australia to get to the 43 per cent, it would cost something like $100 billion. So the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation fund is not going to cover it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you think that the private sector is going to stump up $80 billion of their own money, forget it—unless, of course, it's superannuation money. They might get there that way. It's bad enough that you've got to pay the fuel excise, but now you're being forced into paying 12 per cent super. I say to our young people: don't think you're ever going to see your super again, because they are going to blow it because these super funds are driven by ideology, not productivity—this ESG stuff. They're all bought. You've got the Marxist in the boardroom now. They're not driven by productivity; they're driven by ideology. That is a sure recipe to send this country broke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to touch on one other thing: these electric cars are going to be up to 800 kilograms to 1,000 kilograms heavier. That is going to increase the distance for braking. We're going to have more car accidents because your braking speed is going to be much slower. The weight of these cars can increase by 20 to 30 per cent. We're going to have to use more energy just for the car to travel around because they're going to have massive batteries. These things are solid bricks. Imagine the impact of getting T-boned by these cars, especially here in Australia.</span>

I'll let you guess why we got in touch. He's on my side, by the way, if you're wondering. The reason why we have more liver transplants in Australia is because we drive on the left-hand side of the road. If the driver gets T-boned, it damages the liver. So there are going to be more liver transplants.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is: what about the southern hairy-nosed wombat? What will happen to it when all these inner-city elites from Sydney are driving down in their new EV cars for their ski trip? The member for Warringah had a lovely career growing up, travelling the world and competing in skiing. What will happen to these guys—our little marsupial friends on the road—with increased braking time? Are we going to have more deaths of southern hairy-nosed wombats because of these electric vehicles throughout the winter season, with all the elites driving these heavier cars with longer braking distances? What about all the extra rubber pollution off the tyres and all the extra brake wear? What about that? Have all these people looked into this?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the cost of recycling. Who could forget Larry Marshall's famous words in estimates when he said—and I didn't ask him this; he actually proffered this himself—that it's going to cost three times as much to recycle a battery as it will cost for the materials that actually go into it. What are the chances of that actually ever being economical, when the cost of recycling something is three times more than the cost of building it? I'll tell you: it is not going to happen. This bill will not only destroy the environment; it will destroy the economy and it will destroy our country. It is just another step on the path to destruction because of this useless Albanese Labor government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  The coalition will not support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. It's not because of electric vehicles; it is about bad policy. In this legislation, the government has failed to do a number of things. It has failed to establish clear criteria and metrics of success for the policy. It has failed to ensure the expenditure is temporary, proportionate and linked to tangible productivity gains. It has failed to quantify any benefit of the policy to electric vehicle uptake, to emissions reduction or to the budget bottom line. It has failed to tangibly address the biggest constraint on electric vehicle uptake, which is supply and infrastructure, and it has failed to consult with business and civil society on policy design.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the bill, this government has revealed this to be nothing more than pre-election posturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about a Greens deal to deliver for the inner city and not about practical measures for people in Australia who are struggling with the unaffordable cost of living, who are struggling to meet the basic costs of living. This government is introducing a bill that is going to bake in costs to the budget for years and years to come. This is very serious. It is incredibly serious because the independent Parliamentary Budget Office has said that this bill will cost billions of dollars—that's billions with a 'b', not an 'm'—through the next decade. And yet the government cannot say what it will deliver for emissions reductions. They cannot say what it will deliver to the electric vehicle market. They cannot even say what criteria would make it a success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Demand for electric vehicles is already high. It's growing. Figures from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries shows sales of pure battery electrical vehicles last month represented the highest market share ever recorded. This bill is not just about pure electric vehicles; it also covers hybrid vehicles and variations. My daughter, who lives in Brisbane and is able to commute around the city, has a hybrid vehicle. It is very cheap to run. That's terrific news. But she pays registration and, when she uses diesel or fuel, she pays a fuel tax. But this bill removes the FBT payable on vehicles up to $84,915. It provides a subsidy for people with electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, but not for people who do not have the luxury of a short commute. It does not provide the same advantage to people living in northern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill that is incredibly poorly conceived and poorly budgeted. Despite being referred to as tax reform by the Treasurer, the Senate inquiry suggests this bill is high-cost and low-impact and has been designed with no consultation with industry, government or civil society. A number of experts have a raised serious questions about equity, financial stability and price pressures on the electric vehicle market, and evidence from Treasury and the department of climate change shows the impact of this policy on emissions reduction has not been quantified. Third-party evidence suggests it is negligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am perplexed because, daily, we hear the Treasurer talk about the difficult financial situation he is in. He talks about the $50 billion budget increase, additional income thanks to commodity prices, which he has spent, and he is once again spending more money than he is collecting with this budget measure. It provides a subsidy on FBT to some people but does not make that same subsidy available to every Australian. It does not take into account that some of the vehicles they are subsidising will not pay fuel taxes. It does not take into account the impact on road maintenance and the collections that Treasury relies on in order to fund the cost of road maintenance, of safety concerns for Australians travelling big distances. Instead, it subsidises people who have very short commutes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a crazy policy. We know that there is not enough infrastructure available yet to charge your vehicle. Imagine living in a high-rise building, in Sydney or Melbourne, where there are not enough shareable power points to allow these vehicles to be charged. We see images every day of extension leads draped out of windows and onto the street, to support vehicles that may not be paying the electricity cost to their high-rise building body corporate. Yet the government will subsidise the market share of a vehicle that is growing in popularity. I want to be clear: the opposition are not opposed to this bill because we have any problem with electric or hybrid vehicles; we're opposed to it because of poor infrastructure planning and poor budget planning. This is poor policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Peter Shergold reviewed the government's ability to make good decisions, I am almost positive that this would be a shining example to him of poor government policy and decision-making. 'No consultation' was the No. 1 thing identified by Mr Shergold. 'Poor budget outcomes' was another. There was 'clear criteria', 'measurements of success' and 'ensure the expenditure is temporary, proportionate and linked to tangible productivity gains'—I could go back and repeat the list that I started with, at the beginning of this contribution. I shan't, because there is nothing in this bill and policymaking that gives me any confidence in this government's ability to manage the budget and make good decisions, and I certainly have no confidence in the government supporting people who are not as advantaged as those who have short commutes and who live within places that have—hopefully—some sort of infrastructure to charge their vehicles. It is a government that has no plan to replace diesel fuel and fuel taxes. Instead, we're going to subsidise the FBT benefit for people who are buying electric and hybrid vehicles. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given the cost of EVs, their limited supply and the lack of infrastructure, it seems the cost of this initiative is not warranted, particularly given the small number of vehicles that is anticipated to take advantage of this initiative over the three-year exemption period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a range of quotes. I've quoted the Institute of Public Accountants. There's the Tax Group at the Melbourne Law School, UnitingCare and Treasury. Even Treasury is not able to articulate the long-term costs of this measure. Treasury agrees with the Parliamentary Budget Office that the cost of this measure will grow over time, stating in response to a question on notice that the costs of the measure are expected to increase over time as the measure matures, including into the medium term, and that the Treasury costing is sensitive to the uptake of electric vehicles, and this is something which could vary.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm truly appalled to be part of this Senate, forming part of a parliament that is led by Labor, which is making such poor policies decisions that the only people who support them are the Greens! The only people who support this bill are people who want to encourage electric vehicle rollouts in the face of overwhelming evidence that this is not a necessary budget measure. It is not going to increase the uptake of electric vehicles, which is already a growing, mature market. It is not going to increase the infrastructure that's available to support these vehicles. Worse—for me, as a representative of regional and northern Australia—is that it will not provide any advantage at all to the people who are doing it the toughest: the people who have the highest cost of electricity, the highest cost of insurance and the highest cost of food. The Labor Albanese government, in partnership with the Greens, are delivering for the most entitled and supported group in Australia but they're not supporting poor Australia. They're not supporting working Australia and they're certainly not supporting regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's shocking, and we should be ashamed to sit and pass this piece of legislation, because it is not by any measure good policy. Peter Shergold would tell us that. Blind Freddy on the street would tell us that! This is not a measure that is suitable for the outcomes that this government says it's trying to achieve: budget restraint, emissions reduction and supporting Australians who are struggling with the cost of living.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be ashamed. We have the opportunity in this place—the opportunity that I'm taking right now—to point out shortcomings in policy development. We have the opportunity to get a decision right on this particular bill. I encourage those opposite, members of the government, to pull this bill and to say: 'We're going to go back and think about it. We're going to have another look at how we can deliver on all of our stated objectives.' Budgetary measures, emission measures, consultation with industry, delivering for Australians who are under increasing cost-of-living pressures, the lack of infrastructure that's available to support these vehicles—it's for all these reasons that this poor public policy should be stopped immediately.</span>

I spoke to Toyota last year about a Toyota Mirai, a hydrogen car. It's a great car. James May loves it. I love it. I'm on a list. But I can't refuel it. I can get it but can't refuel it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does this bill mean for me? This means that, on top of my taxpayer funded salary, you're going to give me another 30 grand to buy a car. I don't deserve it, but that's what this is. We're playing races not with cars but with technologies. We're going back to the gaslight versus the electric light or the Betamax versus the VHS, and we're trying to pick winners early.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are different cars. As I said, there's the Mirai hydrogen car, and last month Volkswagen, in cooperation with Kraftwerk—which I thought was a 1980s German techno band but is now an automobile organisation—has lodged patents for a different kind of hydrogen engine, using ceramic instead of plastic. They get 2,000 kilometres of range out of a hydrogen car. You've got the Hyundai N Vision 74 coming out, another hydrogen car that's looking good. I'm watching this space. We all saw Richard Hammond's crash the Rimac, one of the leading-edge electric cars, which took two weeks to put out after it caught on fire because each cell kept on burning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, we have said that we're not anti electric car, but this is a waste of taxpayers' money. People who have had a windfall gain, like me, or been lucky or worked hard in life don't need taxpayers' funds to buy these cars. I have a company; I can do this. If we're going to spend this money, let's build the infrastructure that Senator McDonald was talking about to refuel these cars, to give them range and to give country and regional people the chance to have access to these same things. But we're not; we're giving money to people who are already likely to buy these cars. And we're backdating it for people who have already done this. We're going to say to people who have already bought cars, 'Please have some more money for making a decision that you've already made.' That's a great thing for them, but that's not good for the country. So we sit here looking at a bill that will fund people who don't need it to buy things they've already bought, and we are not out there funding the infrastructure needed. We're not making the cost of living easier for people or making it easier for people to get through what they have to get through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This car won't be captured by road tax. I think Senator O'Sullivan mentioned this. We were working out the battery: there's a 100-kilowatt battery which weighs 666 kilograms. It will be chewing roads, but it won't be captured by the fuel tax. A Toyota Mirai isn't captured by the fuel tax, and we don't have the fuel infrastructure. There is some fuelling in Canberra, but there is nothing in Newcastle and nothing in the Hunter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what is this for? I was in my office when I heard Senator Rennick talking about the hairy-nosed wombat, but a wombat in the spotlights of a LandCruiser coming down the highway—'Oh, an energy electric car, a hydrogen car, we must support it.' That's not good policy. Just because it has some click words and we can share it and do a little TikTok energy dance doesn't make it good policy. Giving money to people who don't need it for decisions they've already made is the definition of waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think COP27 has just been, but last year we went to COP26 and meet with Tesla and the climate change committee of the UK. Their point was not that we need to subsidise cars. People are buying as they see fit. What they were talking about was the infrastructure that can charge these cars, fuel these cars and prevent the road rage that is happening. That is the single determinant in what people take up—how usable they are. And this bill does nothing to make them usable. It takes funds from the government that should be going into building that fuelling infrastructure, and it puts those funds into the pockets of those who don't need it.</span>

We are in this rush for offshore wind—'Let's get this offshore wind because the UK can do it.' The UK has depths in the channel of about 40 metres. The depth on our shelf is about 400 metres or more. Floating wind technology will come, but it is not commercially viable yet. Let's not rush.</span>

Let's face it, at the moment most of the energy for electric cars comes from coal. Prices will have changed, so I'm not breaching any confidentiality. I was working on a hydrogen project at the port of Newcastle. If we wanted to have green hydrogen produced at that time, it was $9 a kilo from renewable clean energy. That's the market telling us that. If I wanted grey hydrogen, it was $2.90 to $3.30. It's not a mystical cloud-cuckoo-land where unicorns fly around and we have wonderful times and can say that something is cheaper. When you have to buy it, at the moment it is not cheaper. We're rushing towards a goal without looking at the consequences.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  We have a modern trend of putting in brackets the attributes of a bill—the talking points, if you like, or the government's propaganda. This bill is called the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. Sometimes there are more accurate parenthetical descriptions of bills. Instead of having 'electric car discount' in the brackets, this one should have 'tax cuts for the rich' in the brackets. That's really what this bill is about. The government provided no evidence to the Senate inquiry on this bill that this bill will lower greenhouse gas emissions—nothing at all. I will come to why they haven't been able to provide that evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Cadell has outlined, this bill will make it harder to fund our road network in the decades to come. By God, we need investment in our roads. In the last sitting period I drove from Rockhampton through Senator Cadell's patch in the Hunter—I went down the New England Highway—to get here. Then I had to drive all the way back. We need a lot of investment in our roads, especially rural roads. This bill will make that harder. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the primary effect of this bill will be a massive tax cut for people on very high incomes, without any real evidence that it's actually going to generate much. I think it's important to go through the figures here to let people know exactly what we're talking about—the size of the tax cut we're talking about for people of very good means. The Australian Taxation Office website has a fringe benefits tax calculator. This bill effectively exempts purchases of electric cars from fringe benefits tax. So when you go and use that calculator, if you bought an electric car worth $50,000—that's a pretty cheap electric car; they start at about $40,000 and most of them would set you back $60,000 or $70,000, sometimes even more, but let's be generous to the government and say a $50,000 electric car—that would provide an annual fringe benefit of $9,972.60. That would come off and be deducted from your taxable income under this bill. You don't get all that saving; that's what your taxable income would fall by, so then the benefit to you depends on your marginal tax rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the more money you earn, the higher your marginal tax rate is and the greater that exemption from fringe benefit will be to you. If you're on $200,000 a year, that's a very good wage, not uncommon—as I'm aware, I'm on about that amount of money—here in this place. This would be a very good bill for politicians, I should say, for those listening out there. Politicians will do very well out of this bill. But if you're on $200,000 a year—as I said, that's a well above average wage, about double the average full-time wage in Australia—you'll be on a 50 per cent marginal rate, roughly, so that $9,900 deduction will actually help you out $5,000 a year. You'll be $5,000 a year better off thanks to a Labor government. In this country the Labor Party is giving a rich person, someone on that sort of money, a $5,000 free kick a year. Amazing. If you're in the lowest tax bracket, if you're earning only 50 grand a year out there—not the lowest tax bracket but the lowest one above which you pay tax—your benefit will be just $1,000 a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear lectures often from the Labor Party about how they try and represent the poor. They accuse us of giving tax cuts to the rich and of cutting services to the poor, and here we have a bill, one of the very first bills that this Labor government have introduced, which is all about giving massive tax cuts to the rich. You have to wonder how many extra electric cars will be bought thanks to this bill. We don't know. There has been no evidence provided by Treasury, the government or the committee. I know people, some friends of mine, who do very well and earn very good wages. They are rubbing their hands with glee because they're going to get these multiple-thousand dollar tax deductions when they've already bought Teslas. Keep in mind this bill is backdated to 1 July this year, so anyone who has bought a Tesla in the last few months, even if they didn't know they were going to get the deduction, just gets a free kick. 'Here you go. Thank you for electing a Labor government. Here's 5,000 bucks a year,' to a rich person. That's a year. Over the life of the car it'll be tens of thousands of dollars, as Senator Rennick pointed out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, if nothing else, will go through this place, because they've got partners in the Greens here. The average income of Greens voters is way higher than any other political party in this place, so they have that constituency. They have an excuse, the Greens. Their voters are on $200,000 a year, quite often, so we know they've got to look after their voters. The Labor Party's voters are still about the average income, but I don't think they've even realised yet—they're going to find out, especially in this term of government—that the Labor Party aren't really for the working class anymore; they are for the rich, well-educated, tertiary-educated professional classes in this country. Good luck to those people. A lot of my friends are those people, but the Labor Party are out to protect their interests, not the working class in this country, who cannot afford to buy even a $50,000 Tesla—I don't think you can buy Teslas for that price, but a $50,000 electric car—let alone a $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000 electric car. That's just beyond those people who are struggling right now with higher living costs. They will get no benefit from this particular bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I foreshadowed earlier too, on top of all that, on top of the regressive nature of this bill, it's not even clear that this bill will lower carbon emissions at all. As I mentioned, there has been no evidence provided by the government that this will encourage additional electric vehicles to be purchased, and actually there are very large questions about how much electric cars themselves will lower carbon emissions, because the basic problem here is that the manufacture of electric vehicles is extremely energy intensive and by being energy intensive is therefore carbon-emissions intensive. In fact in a recent study by Volvo on one of their vehicles, on the equivalent of the XC40 for their electric fleet, that car actually created 70 per cent more carbon emissions in its manufacture than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. So the electric car has 70 per cent higher emissions when it comes off the lot than the internal combustion engine car. So there are higher emissions, and from day one of this bill coming into effect—if it does mean that additional electric cars are purchased and more are produced—then there's no doubt that it will actually increase carbon emissions over the next few years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, electric cars don't use petrol and therefore, potentially, have lower carbon emissions in their use, but they do need electricity to be charged. So what's crucial to the carbon emissions calculations are what types of electricity electric cars use to charge. This Volvo report had some very good analysis of that. It showed that if the electricity you source for your electric vehicle came from the global average of different fuel types, then coal accounts for about 40 per cent of that and gas is about 15 per cent. So you would be looking at close to half of your electricity probably coming from fossil fuels. If that's the electricity grid that you charge your car from then you'd have to drive the car 110,000 kilometres before it became carbon neutral. That's just to be at the same amount as the internal combustion engine—not better! It would just break even with the internal combustion engine after you had driven 110,000 kilometres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The average Australian drives 13,300 kilometres in a year. So the average Australian would need to drive the car for eight years—eight years!—before they could break even. There wouldn't be any savings, they would just break even. The Labor Party came to government saying that they're going to reduce carbon emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. By my maths, that's in how many years? Eight years! That will be in eight years time. So this bill will actually increase carbon emissions from now—global carbon emissions, because of course these cars will be built overseas—over the next eight years. That's because all these electric cars will be carbon positive for the first eight years of their lives, on average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we doing this? What's the point of this? I should add, as a bit of a footnote to this, that that analysis is based on the global fuel electricity mix, as I said, but in fact Australia has a more carbon-intensive electricity system than the rest of the globe. We get about 60 per cent of our electricity from coal and another 20-odd per cent from gas, so our particular break-even number is different. I don't have access to the modelling to do my own figures on it, but you'd actually have to drive one for longer. So I'm being generous to the government here; it would probably be 10 or maybe 12 years of driving here in Australia before you got to carbon neutrality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Really, we have to wonder what this is all about. If we're serious about reducing carbon emissions, why are we spending so much money on cars that are much more carbon intensive? You have to wonder—and you have to come back to the money. That's what this is about. It's about the money and it's about giving people a tax break to buy a new car. If they can afford it, good luck to them—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CANAVAN:</span>
                    </a>  Well, I don't know if it's ideology, Senator Rennick. I think it just comes down to money. It's just that people want to have a subsidised vehicle. Good luck to them, but we're approaching a trillion dollars in debt and we have to get our house in order—and we're coming out of the coronavirus period. I don't think we have the money to provide very, very rich people in this country with a subsidy for a new car. I don't think that should be a fundamental priority of this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to come back to Senator Cadell's excellent point about the fact that electric vehicles are already subsidised, in a sense, or, at least they get favoured treatment in our overall tax system. Electric cars are not subject to any kind of fuel excise. We don't hype that fuel excise. I think it's almost 40c now on petrol or diesel when you go to fill up your car. About 40c of that comes back to Canberra here. It doesn't directly go back to roads, but the basic system is that we put that tax on fuel so that we can have funds to invest back into roads, and especially into rural roads that aren't doing so well. We spend about the same amount of money that's raised from car registration at the state level and the fuel excise on roads every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As electric cars continue to be in demand, that revenue source will dry up and we won't get that fuel excise anymore. So there is a real question here about how we fund our roads. Of course, those people buying electric cars already get that benefit. They already get that now. They don't have to pay a fuel excise to drive and run their car. It's an open question how we will tackle this issue going forward, but there actually already is an in-built subsidy to electric cars right now. This bill just perpetuates that subsidy and not in ways that seem as if they will progress any particular public good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we also need to understand here how these electric cars are made. I said before that they're very carbon intensive, but the other issue here is that the minerals and techniques that are used to create batteries have potentially other environmental downsides as well. It's something that goes complete unremarked, especially by the renewable energy industry, that production of cobalt, nickel and lithium in some countries can be extremely environmentally hazardous. There are ways of doing this properly—and I would argue our mining industry in this country does generally do things properly—but that comes at a certain cost. The production right now of especially minerals like cobalt is done largely in developing countries. Cobalt is produced largely in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there are terrible labour standards and also shocking environmental outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for this is that those minerals that go into batteries—unlike fossil fuels like petrol, oil, gas and coal—aren't easily obtained in the natural environment. Coal, oil and gas, generally speaking, are contained in large deposits and are quite easily extracted without having to do too much to them—maybe a bit of washing with water in the case of coal. In the case of these hard rock minerals, like nickel and cobalt, you have to engage in serious use of chemicals to extract the somewhat rare ores within the overall rock that you've mined. There's a huge amount of waste, a huge amount of energy and, yes, a huge amount chemical use. As I say, if you do that properly, you can protect the environment—but it's costly and it takes significant regulation. However, in countries like Congo, you don't have those regulations and you have terrible environmental pollution of rivers and environmental wastelands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does nothing to set any standards. While we are doing this, why don't we set standards? Why don't we say we'll subsidise only cars that have ethical standards for the sourcing of cobalt and nickel? Again, it comes back to the money. That's what this is about. We won't set those standards because that would interrupt the money flows that are going to people in the renewable energy industry from the Greens and their voters, and of course the rich people will get a massive big tax cut thanks to this so-called Labor bill.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">tor GALLAGHER</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  I would like to begin by thanking senators who have contributed to the debate. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022 implements the government's election commitment to provide a fringe benefits tax exemption for employer provided eligible electric cars. The bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to exempt from fringe benefits tax the use or availability of eligible electric cars made available by employers to employees from 1 July 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Economics Legislation Committee has considered and reported on the bill. We thank the committee for its work, and we also acknowledge and thank the individuals and organisations who provided submissions through that and appeared at the public hearings. Overwhelmingly there was support for the measures; however, some thought the bill could go further and raised issues such as fuel efficiency standards and the need for a comprehensive national electric vehicle strategy. The government is putting in place the next steps to establish Australia's first national electric vehicle strategy. At the heart of the strategy will be a plan to improve uptake of electric vehicles and further improve affordability and choice by growing the Australian electric vehicle market. The government welcomes the committee's recommendation that the bill be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens support a fringe benefits tax exemption for electric cars but are recommending that plug-in hybrid vehicles be excluded on the basis that such vehicles are not zero-emission vehicles. While the government appreciates this view, it also recognises our current low take-up of any electric vehicles and the important role that plug-in hybrids can play in facilitating Australia's transition to zero-emission vehicles, particularly in rural and regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have also recommended the inclusion of personal electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The government is looking at more direct support for EV charging through our Powering Australia plan, and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy recently announced funding for a streetside EV charger trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge that the opposition provided a dissenting report recommending that the bill not be supported and that the funds be redeployed to other methods of increasing EV uptake, including infrastructure. The government is supporting EV infrastructure through the Powering Australia plan and exploring further options to increase electric vehicle uptake through the National Electric Vehicle Strategy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments contained in this bill will incentivise greater electric car uptake in Australia and contribute to reducing our emissions. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an amendment to review the operations of how successful this measure is actually going to be at increasing the use of electric vehicles. We've had a lot of debate during the debate on this bill about the effectiveness of this measure and whether this is the appropriate measure and the most effective measure to increase the use of electric vehicles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my second reading contribution, the Greens are supporting this bill. It's a small step forward, and we believe there are much more significant measures that need to be taken to really kickstart the use of electric vehicles. But this is an important measure, and it's an important measure for getting electric vehicles into fleets. It's an important measure to then be able to have electric vehicles flowing through as second-hand vehicles. But we thought it very appropriate, given there are a whole raft of different ways we could be supporting the use of electric vehicles—although we actually think that getting decent fuel efficiency standards and carbon dioxide standards is probably the most important thing to do, and we are hoping that the government will introduce something along those lines—in the meantime to have a review in place to determine whether this legislation is effective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, the review would occur after three years from the commencement and it would include consideration of whether the operation of some or all of these provisions should continue and what types of vehicles should be covered by the provisions. Of course, what types of vehicles goes to the point of the issue of zero-emission vehicles versus low-emission vehicles, which is in the other amendments that Senator David Pocock is go to move. Those amendments would phase out plug-in hybrid electric vehicles being eligible for this discount after three years. We think that after three years it would be very appropriate to do that review, to make sure that this measure is being effective.</span>

Given the substantial cost of the measure to the budget over the medium term, it is essential that this proposal be reviewed rigorously. During the Senate inquiry into the legislation, the government could not outline any criteria that the policy's success or failure would be measured against. Given the alarming lack of policy analysis underpinning the legislation, it's important that it be subject to a thorough and wide-ranging review. While the coalition oppose the broader bill, we will support amendments to ensure that, if it does pass, appropriate safeguards are placed around the substantial costs of this measure.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome this bill and the function it serves to create a second-hand EV market in Australia. This is much needed. Most Australians are currently priced out of the EV market. Incentivising EVs in this way for fleets will have flow-on effects to create that affordable EV market which will allow a number of people to get into it and unlock the cost savings that electric vehicles provide, both in terms of not having to fill them up with petrol at the servo but also in reducing maintenance costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's a great thing to incentivise EVs in this way, there is a concern with plug-in hybrid vehicles over the long term. The reality is that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in fleets are not plugged in often and end up being used on the engine, which is a smaller engine, and, as has been pointed out many times, they are heavier vehicles. This drastically increases the amount of fuel that they use. These amendments will limit the problems with the plug-in hybrids. There is a sunset clause which provides certainty for fleets and people who are looking to get a vehicle. It ensures that we are moving towards the more efficient and newer technology of battery electric vehicles. I thank the government and the Greens for the way in which they have approached this issue to reach this outcome.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  I also want to speak in support of these amendments. Obviously, the whole aim of this legislation is to reduce emissions from our vehicles and to shift to zero-carbon vehicles. As I said in my speech during the second reading stage, this is what we need to be doing so that our carbon pollution from transport can be reduced as much as it can be in as quick a time as possible. Including plug-in electric vehicles in this scheme was just going to continue—and not just continue but subsidise—vehicles which have ongoing and substantial use of fossil fuels. A report was done just this year by the International Council on Clean Transportation which showed that the use of petrol or diesel in plug-in hybrids is actually much greater than what the manufacturers claim. Rather than claim fuel consumption of about 1.6 litres per 100 kilometres, the real-world experience across Europe is that as these cars are being driven they're actually being driven on their petrol motor a lot more and ending up with fuel consumption of around four litres per 100 kilometres. So they are, in fact, a fossil fuel vehicle and certainly are not deserving of subsidies. Essentially, if we included plug-in hybrids in this legislation, it would be yet another ongoing subsidy for fossil fuels, which is the last thing we need when we should be doing everything we can to tackle our climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We thought coming to the position of phasing out plug-in hybrid vehicles out of this scheme over three years was a reasonable compromise. Clearly, we do have an issue at the moment of a lack of supply of electric vehicles. The previous government was so recalcitrant and did nothing to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles that the vehicle manufacturers just said, 'Why would we bring electric vehicles to Australia?' It just has not been a good market for them. We know that for anybody wanting to buy a new electric vehicle at the moment, the wait time is six to 12 months. So we do have an issue with supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are allowing plug-in hybrids to be included in the scheme, to encourage their uptake for the next three years. They do, at least, produce lower emissions in general, but it's not something you'd want to continue for any longer than those three years. We really need to shift to zero-carbon vehicles as quickly as possible. We know that the world is facing climate catastrophe. We know that we have to reduce our carbon pollution by at least 75 per cent by 2030, otherwise the consequences are extremely dire. We think we've got problems with floods and fires at the moment—and that's after just over one degree of global warning—but we are headed for three degrees of global warming. We absolutely need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to shift to getting a zero-carbon fleet as soon as possible. We know that cars that are purchased today have a lifetime of 10, 15 or 20 years, so it is important to get all the support for 100 per cent completely renewable, zero-carbon vehicles as soon as possible and not to prolong the use of fossil fuel vehicles in any way for any longer than is necessary.</span>

Hybrids play an important role in bridging the gap between internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles. They are more affordable, have a wider range and produce lower emissions than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Importantly, they are also very popular choices with consumers. There is substantial stakeholder support for retaining hybrids in the bill, in the event that it does pass.</span>

Given that the top-selling vehicles are Toyota HiLux, Ford Ranger, Isuzu D-MAX—these are dual-cab utes—as well as, in the top four, the Toyota RAV4, has the government received any advice that there will be pure electric vehicles available, in that class of vehicle, in the following years that would be available for purchase? Has the government sought any advice from manufacturers as to whether those vehicles will be available? My understanding is that they do have some hybrids earmarked but they are still some years away. So what advice have you received as to whether or not there will be those vehicles available, given that that's what Australians are choosing to buy right now? </span>

I think what you're seeing around the world is that where there are supportive arrangements in legislation or regulation manufacturers respond to that. We are seeing the effort, in terms of manufacture and output going into the design and delivery of electric vehicles over standard petrol vehicles. That's just the reality of what's happening. That's where the R&amp;D is going. It's where the manufacturing effort is going. </span>

Obviously there will be some vehicles, including special-purpose vehicles and in Defence, for example, where that is not possible. So we'll take a sensible and responsible approach. But we want to generate an affordable second-hand car market as well. We're a big purchaser of vehicles, and it's responsible and shows a bit of leadership for the government in doing that. </span>

The fund will support electric vehicle chargers across Australia. It will also support electric fleets and vehicle-to-grid technology. Initial investments under the fund will be $39.8 million over four years for a national EV charging network to be delivered by the NRMA, and $89.5 million over four years for a national expansion of hydrogen highways. The remainder of the fund will be delivered by ARENA, but initial investments are expected to target charging infrastructure for regional and remote areas and household managed charging.</span>
