           Audit Report 33 of 1992-93, The Sale of Aussat and best practice for the sale of Commonwealth assets
          </emphasis>
          . The completion of the Aussat sale in December 1991 marked an important step in the development of Australia's telecommunications system. The sale was coupled with the granting of a general telecommunications licence to the successful bidder, Optus Communications, thus removing Telecom's longstanding monopoly in this field. The present duopoly arrangements are scheduled to terminate on 30 June 1997, when the industry will be exposed to even wider competition.

          The sale was made difficult by several factors which combined to lessen the Commonwealth's bargaining position. Aussat had, by the time of the sale, accumulated debts totalling some $800 million with little prospect for improvement, and one of the two bidding consortia had disintegrated—three of the four partners had withdrawn. Finally, there was a deadline imposed for completion of the sale. In order to make Aussat more attractive, the company's debts were repaid by the Commonwealth and a second telecommunications licence was added to the sale.

          The principal findings of the audit report were that the sale was completed on time, in accordance with the government's objectives and at an acceptable price. The committee agrees with these findings. Indeed, the committee believes that those negotiating the sale on behalf of the Commonwealth did a very good job in difficult circumstances.

          In conducting its review, the committee took a forward looking approach and focused on aspects of the sale which affect the Commonwealth's future interests. Two areas were of particular interest to the committee. The first was to ensure that appropriate mechanisms were in place to monitor the future performance obligations entered into by Optus. The second was to draw lessons from the Aussat sale experience which may help improve future sales processes, particularly given the recent debate over the FAC and ANL.

          As part of the sale agreement, Optus undertook to achieve certain goals in the period up to the end of the telecommunications duopoly. The main undertakings were:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         .to extend its fixed and mobile telecommunications network throughout Australia, achieving certain `network roll-out' milestones at various dates up to June 1997; and

         .to achieve certain levels of investment, Australian content, and expenditure on training and research and development.
        </para>
        <para>
         One of the committee's main concerns was that, at the time of sale, the Department of Communications and the Arts did not have in place any arrangements with which to monitor Optus's network roll-out performance. By way of contrast, the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development—as it was at the time—had an extensive system in place to monitor Optus's industry development undertakings.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee acknowledges that the Department of Communications and the Arts now has in place an acceptable monitoring system. However, the committee believes it to be important that such arrangements be negotiated as an integral part of a contract for the sale of an asset. It is inappropriate and unnecessarily risky for the Commonwealth to seek to negotiate such arrangements after a sale has been concluded.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          A second lesson to be drawn for future sales is that any provision for `excusable events' should be clearly defined so that the rights and obligations of all parties are clearly understood. The committee explored the audit office's concern that the excusable events clause in the Aussat sale deed could threaten the timing of Optus's network roll-out. This stemmed from the vague, broad nature of the clause and the limited and inflexible range of responses available to the Commonwealth in the event of any network roll-out delays.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          At the public hearing into the sale, the committee was pleased to receive advice from Optus that there had been no excusable events to date and that Optus had agreed to give the department forewarning of any intention to invoke the excusable events provisions. The committee sympathises with Audit's concern in relation to the breadth of the excusable events provision in the Aussat sale contract, but accepts that the provision was the best available in the circumstances.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Commonwealth's relatively poor bargaining position also contributed to the absence of any liquidated damages provisions with the contract. The committee was advised by the department that inclusion of such provisions was considered by Optus to be a `deal breaker'.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee was informed, however, that, despite the absence of such contract enforcement provisions, there were various commercial incentives for Optus to fulfil its obligations. These were: the opportunity for fines under the licence agreement if Optus failed to meet its network roll-out milestones—the licence conditions are monitored by Austel; Optus's acknowledgment in the roll-out deed that failure to meet its obligations will yield the Commonwealth pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages; and, most severe of all, the loss of favourable introductory interconnect rates with Telecom if the Optus system is connected to Telecom's after certain specified dates.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee was advised during the public hearing that Optus was in fact substantially ahead of its roll-out schedule. Nevertheless, the committee notes that towards the end of network roll-out, as less profitable areas are reached and as the end of the duopoly approaches, the commercial imperatives for Optus could weaken. This is not to say that Optus would forsake its obligations. As I have already indicated, Optus has more than met its obligations to date. Rather, it is to say that the reserve powers of regulatory penalties could become more important to the Commonwealth than they are at present. The committee therefore considers that in future sales the Commonwealth should seek to enforce performance covenants through a combination of commercial and regulatory penalties or incentives.

          In conclusion, the committee believes that, notwithstanding the areas of concern we have raised, the Commonwealth achieved the best possible outcome in the circumstances. Those involved in the second telecommunications carrier selection team should be congratulated. Nevertheless, the audit report and the committee's review have highlighted issues which the committee hopes will assist in any future sale of Commonwealth assets.

          In closing, I put on record again our thanks to the very good staff we have in the public accounts committee: our Secretary, Grant Harrison, and our section committee secretary, who was, on this occasion, Dr John Carter and who was ably assisted by Ross Allen and also by inquiry staff member, Yolanda Campagna. I add a special thanks to Yolanda today because it is her last day with the public accounts committee. She is being married next weekend and is moving to another department after that. She has been a wonderful asset to the public accounts committee and we would like to put on record in this place our very great thanks to her for her committed work for the committee. I am sure the staff of the committee and all my colleagues would agree with me. I commend the report to the House.

        The references to provision numbers in the Migration Act 1958, the act, in this speech are, unless otherwise indicated, references to provision numbers as they were before the renumbering of the Migration Act 1958 on 1 September 1994. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), through its proposed changes to sections 35 and 36 of the act, which were renumbered in December 1989 to become sections 87 and 88 respectively, seeks to restore to those sections the effect they were thought to possess prior to the decision of the High Court in Chu Kheng Lim v. Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in December 1992.

         It was this decision which gave rise to the commencement of claims against the Commonwealth for compensation for wrongful imprisonment of a number of unauthorised boat arrivals, who are usually referred to as boat people. Prior to this decision no-one had questioned the use of section 36 of the act—from December 1989 to September 1994 numbered as section 88—to detain the unauthorised arrivals in question. Indeed, those sections were not challenged in the Lim proceedings.

         Section 36 of the act deals with people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation and who may be kept in custody until the departure of the vessel from its last port of call in Australia. Up until May 1991, unauthorised boat arrivals of this kind were detained in custody under this section while their claims to remain in Australia were assessed.

         In the Lim case other aspects of migration legislation involving boat people were challenged, and doubt was subsequently cast upon the lawfulness of detention for a number of boat people under section 88 once it became apparent that the boats on which they had arrived would never depart Australia. This doubt turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the understanding that the vessel be expected to leave Australia on a further, outward and ongoing voyage.

         In this instance, the Commonwealth acted on a mistaken view of what the law was, believing—like all other concerned parties—that its detention of boat people was lawful. It is significant that no-one, apparently including the boat people themselves—and their legal representatives—saw any reason to question the lawfulness of detention on the basis that none of the vessels on which they had arrived had ever left Australia. Should that custody prove to have been unlawful, it is as a result of an innocent and technical breach, and no more.

         This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people did arrive in Australia unlawfully, and their detention was based on the understanding of the provisions of section 36 (section 88) by the government and the department at that time. Nevertheless, actions for damages have been lodged by some 88 of the boat people who now maintain that their detention under section 36 (section 88) was unlawful.

         New provisions to detain unauthorised boat arrivals came into effect in May 1992 with the commencement of division 4B of the act. These provisions, under which the boat people have been detained since May 1992, were found by the High Court in the Lim case to be constitutionally valid. However, at that time the High Court cast doubt upon the use of section 88 to detain boat people. As a consequence, section 54RA was enacted in late December 1992 with the support of the opposition. This section extinguished the right of action for damages for false imprisonment for persons found to have been unlawfully detained under section 88 prior to their transfer to custody under division 4B of the act, replacing it with a statutory right of action limiting to $1 per day the damages payable.

        It is essential to counter the possibility of significant damages claims.

        A case challenging the constitutional validity of the compensation scheme established in section 54RA—I would repeat that the compensation scheme in section 54RA was regarded as constitutionally valid when it was established—is yet to be heard by the High Court. The main ground for challenge is likely to be that section 54RA breaches section 51(xxxi) of the constitution, in that it involves an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth otherwise than on just terms. A number of High Court decisions since section 54RA was enacted on the ambit of the `just terms' requirement in the constitution have raised doubts whether the limit on damages to $1 per day is constitutional.

         As I earlier remarked, the amendments proposed seek to reflect the Commonwealth's previous understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) and their operation. Legislative amendments of this kind can be classed as `curative', which retrospectively corrects defects discovered in the law or its administration, and restores what was previously thought by all parties to be the status quo.

         Recent High Court judgements involving the `just terms' requirement of our constitution have suggested that this approach of `curative' legislation is an avenue available to the Commonwealth. Indeed the courts, including the present Chief Justice of the High Court, have emphasised that it is always open for parliament to correct developments in the law, other than in constitutional matters, where those developments do not accord with parliament's intention.

         The rationale for curative legislation is the strong public interest in the proper functioning of government. Occasional defects in administration or statutory drafting are inevitable, and it may be fairly argued that a law which seeks retrospectively to cure innocent defects does not take away rights, but merely gives effect to administrative action already taken—action, it should be noted, which was previously assumed by all relevant parties to be valid.

         This bill—the No. 3 bill—is substantially identical to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 introduced to the other place on 8 June 1994. The government has introduced this bill to the House with the intention of placing the Commonwealth in the strongest possible position to defend the claims for compensation. The bill seeks only to achieve the same effect as what was intended by the enactment of section 54RA—to prevent a possible windfall of a substantial award of damages to persons who arrived in Australia without lawful authority and were held in detention for the legitimate reason of assessing their claims to stay in this country as refugees. In this way, the government seeks to ensure that section 88 has, and always had, the effect and operation that parliament intended.

         The opposition parties were swayed in their decision to oppose the curative measures in this bill when it was introduced to the other place by the dissenting report of their members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its consideration of the No. 2 bill. That report attempts to distinguish the proposed curative steps in the No. 3 bill from the dollar a day provision on the ground of retrospectivity. This is pure sophistry.

         Section 54RA limits any compensation payable to $1 per day after the cause of action concerned has already arisen. Thus the parliament has already applied retrospective measures to substantially limit the claims of the boat people for compensation. Sufficient doubt has now been placed upon the measures taken to date for the government to accept the necessity of pursuing further retrospective measures of a curative nature to ensure that the Commonwealth is in the strongest possible position to defend these claims.

         The dissenting report also adopted the line pursued in the submission of the Law Council of Australia before the committee that the curative measures would distort the relationship between the legislative and judicial arms of government. This submission ignores the well established prerogative of the parliament to legislate so as to affect and alter existing rights at issue in pending litigation without interfering with the exercise of judicial power in a way that is inconsistent with the constitution. Until the High Court decides otherwise, curative legislation of this nature remains a valid course open to the parliament.

         I turn now to the curative provisions of the bill. The amendments to sections 35 and 36 (sections 87 and 88) do not seek to change the operation of those sections, but insert new provisions intended instead to reflect the Commonwealth's understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) and the manner in which they were actually administered in practice prior to the commencement of Division 4B. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted at every stage of the drafting process. It is the view of that department that the amendments are not inconsistent with Australia's obligations under international law.

         The proposed subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) seeks to put beyond doubt that section 36 (section 88) authorises the custody, for a finite period, of persons who arrive without lawful authority on board a vessel that subsequently is unable to depart Australia because it has been destroyed, or for example is not seaworthy, has been impounded or forfeited, has sunk, or is otherwise unable to depart.

         This amendment also permits the taking and keeping of persons in custody, notwithstanding that the vessel on which those persons departed for Australia might not necessarily be the same vessel on which those persons arrived. It is restricted to persons who arrive on vessels that have left an Australian port and returned to an Australian port without having entered any other country. This covers situations where a person arrives at a port in Australia on an Australian based vessel to which the person was transferred from the vessel on which that person left another country, for instance to a rescue vessel when the original vessel is about to sink.

         In the circumstances envisaged by new subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) it is not appropriate that the period for which a person may be detained should be determined by reference to the departure of a vessel from a port. The proposed amendments will, therefore, provide that custody is to be authorised until the person is granted an entry permit, or for such period as is necessary to allow for the person's removal from Australia following a request in writing from the person to be removed, or after all applications to remain—for example, entry permit applications and applications for refugee status—and associated appeals or reviews have been finalised; or once all consideration of whether the person will be permitted to remain in Australia has been otherwise concluded; or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs.

         Under the act, persons are considered to have entered Australia once they disembark in Australia. Proposed subsection 36(1AB) (subsection 88(1B)) makes it clear that persons are taken not to have entered Australia as a result of temporarily, haphazardly disembarking—for instance, on an island off the Australian mainland, briefly and without the knowledge of the Australian authorities—after which the persons then reboard their vessel.

         I repeat that these simple, commonsense amendments, curative in nature, seek no more than to ensure that sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) of the act have and have had the operation and effect that parliament intends them to have, which is the operation and effect which the department and ministers previously understood those provisions to have had.

         The bill also inserts a constitutional validity or `reading down' provision. This will provide, unless a contrary intention can be clearly discerned, that where a provision of the act could have both valid and invalid applications, the provision is not to have the invalid application but is to have every valid application. The provision is similar to, and consistent with, `reading down' provisions in certain other Commonwealth legislation.

         —Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994. I take the opportunity to make it clear that this bill does make certain amendments to the Migration Act which are retrospective to 1 November 1989, in an attempt, on the government's part, to ensure that certain provisions of the act are consistent with what the minister and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs claim to have previously understood to be their effect.

         It needs to be understood that the bill is a retrospective attempt to deal with an issue which has plagued successive ministers in this government. It is an issue entirely of the government's own making and one which ought to be—and I believe is—of concern to all Australians, not just the people affected by this.

         It has long been regarded that retrospective legislation dealing with tax, when new obligations are imposed upon people, and issues relating to people's detention are not courses of action upon which governments ought to embark lightly. The courts have recognised that and take a very strict view in relation to the interpretation of legislation designed to have that impact. That is probably the reason that we see in this bill some very imaginative drafting in even trying to instruct the courts as to the way in which they are to consider these particular provisions.

         Before going into detail, let me give the reasons that we have taken this course. We see the bill as being designed to make lawful what is now unlawful. It attempts to change the law so that the unlawful action of depriving a number of people—`boat people', as they have been termed—of their liberty between November 1989 and May 1992 is now deemed to be lawful. In other words, it is saying in relation to people who were detained illegally—and that has been established—that that detention was not illegal at all; it is lawful. We are being asked to validate that by this parliament.

         The bill is clearly retrospective. The only non-retrospective actions are the parts dealing with the repeal of section 54RA, as it was known, which was the previous attempt to address this issue. It applies only to boat people unlawfully detained between November 1989 and May 1992. It has no application to any future unauthorised arrivals. Their detentions will be lawful as a result of the Migration Reform Act, which came into operation on 1 September—the same act that prompted the renumbering of the clauses. I am not in a position to readily adjust my comments today to all of the consequences that flow from that redrafting. My speech might be read in the context of the provisions as they previously operated.

         The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) breaches several basic principles of law. It condones the proposition that wherever unlawful administrative action has been taken the parliament may by a retrospective initiative cure it. Acceptance of this proposition would, as the Law Council of Australia says, destroy or at least significantly diminish the Commonwealth administrative law system.

         The background to this matter is that certain unauthorised arrivals in the form of boat people—mainly Cambodians but also Chinese, Vietnamese and other nationals—began arriving in Australia in November 1988. They were detained under section 88 of the Migration Act. Section 88 of the act is said to apply to the `custody of certain persons during stay of vessel in port'. It needs to be understood that these provisions were first enacted essentially to deal with stowaways, where there was an expectation that a person who stayed ashore would, when the vessel left, be delivered to the boat and be taken out of Australia. That was the purpose of the provisions—and they were drawn specifically to address that purpose.

         When the government was faced with boat people, it cast around to find some provisions which it could use to hold these people. Because they had arrived on a boat and had come onshore, the government took them into detention under section 88. I might say that section 88 has been renumbered. It was an earlier section, as I recall, under the old act. But the fact is that the government thought it would be able to continue to hold people under this fiction that a boat was still going to be there for the people to be delivered to, to take them away. Nobody had thought about what happens if the boat is no longer there.

         What had happened is that some of the boats had sunk and some were destroyed for quarantine purposes—and nobody in the government saw fit to look at this matter and ask whether the legislation under which the people were being held was flawed. I have to say that it is quite extraordinary to see the statement in the second reading speech that, prior to the decisions in which the High Court addressed this matter, nobody had questioned the use of section 88. As if that provides some justification! The fact is that there were not people arriving or being detained before that time. This issue became a cause for concern because boat people started to arrive in 1989—and the basis upon which they were being held was then looked at.

         It was not a question before that time largely because the government was not being faced with the issue. It seems to me that when the government was first faced with the issue, when people looked at section 88, or its predecessor, they should have looked immediately at ensuring there was a proper basis for people to continue to be held. It might have even had an important impact in terms of mitigating damages, if the matter was not addressed promptly.

         If the government had come to us—and it was about that time that I was shadow minister for immigration—it would have had cooperation on addressing those matters. The government has received the utmost cooperation from us over time in relation to those matters. In early 1992, several Cambodian detainees challenged the validity of section 88 in the Lim case. They challenged the legal right of the government to detain them. It was the only section under the act which could possibly have been used. The challenge has become known as the Lim case after one of the plaintiffs.

         On 5 May 1992, two days before the plaintiffs' action for release was due to commence in court, the government rushed amendments to the Migration Act through the parliament—with our support. The amendments introduced a new division 4(b) which validated the continued detention of non-citizens who had been on a boat in a territorial sea of Australia after 19 November 1989—and, in effect, before 1 September 1994, which was the date for the commencement before the Migration Reform Act.

In its comments, however, it expressed the view that section 88 had not authorised any detention of plaintiffs prior to 6 May 1992 and that such detention had been unlawful. A majority of the judges held that the detention ceased to be lawful under section 88 after the destruction of the boat on which the persons arrived or because of other circumstances if the boat was made unavailable for the person's departure.

         In anticipation that the boat people, who were now lawfully detained under division 4B after 6 May 1992, might bring down a common law action for damages for unlawful detention for the period prior to 6 May, the government brought to the parliament in late 1992 another amendment—section 54R of the Migration Act. This section extinguished the common law right of action for damages for unlawful imprisonment for boat people prior to 6 May 1992 and replaced the common law right with a statutory right capping the amount of damages payable at a dollar a day.

         The coalition supported that bill, but I have to make it clear that it would not have done so if the bill had contained any element of retrospectivity. I was involved in the most detailed discussions on that matter with the minister at the time, Mr Hand, and it ought to be understood that the government proposed at that time this course of action which we are being asked to follow in this legislation. It proposed the alternative—the quantification of damages. In other words, you would not destroy people's right to bring a claim for false arrest or illegal detention, unlawful detention—you would not exhaust their capacity to bring that action—but you would quantify the damages that they were able to obtain.

         The government believed that course would be successful, and was advised by its advisers that it would be, and it legislated at that time in that way because it knew it would not receive support from this side of the House in relation to a retrospective validation of detention.

The prime purpose of the December 1992 bill was to limit the impact of the claim for damages, although it did contain other amendments as well. In this respect it extended coverage to include boat people arriving on or after 1 December 1992 until commencement.

The High Court has listed the matter for 12 October, this week. I understand it has been further adjourned.

         The difficulty with section 54RA, however, is that it does not operate to cure the defect of legality of the plaintiff's prior detention by retrospectively authorising or validating it. This section merely limits the common law rights to damages to a nominal amount in respect of a period of unlawful detention that may remain unlawful. I want to say in relation to that matter that no amount of argument by the government that this detention was innocent and no more than a technical breach should sustain this legislation. It may be relevant to the claim for damages. In that context I think it is a proper matter that should be considered. It is certainly inappropriate for the government to argue, as it has in relation to this matter, that this bill seeks to achieve only the same effect as what was intended by the enactment of section 54RA. Clearly, section 54RA was not intended to have a retrospective impact. That is the reason that we supported it.

         It also needs to be understood that, when the government argues that the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, attempting to distinguish the proposed curative steps from the dollar a day provision, was pure sophistry, that is, in my view, a flawed view. The differences in this matter have always been significant. The concept of quantifying damages is not unusual. It is not unknown. It has been used in other legislation, other forums and other places. But retrospectively validating the detention of people is rare and is a major issue of principle.

If this bill were passed and it withstood the inevitable strong challenge, it would seek to make lawful what the High Court now regards to be unlawful; that is, the detention of boat people who had arrived in Australia between November 1989 and May 1992.

         In the explanatory memorandum the government listed three arguments to justify retrospectivity. It said the amendments need to be retrospective, firstly, to prevent the possible windfall through substantial award of damages; secondly, because the minister and the department thought the law gave them power to detain people in custody; and, thirdly, because none of those who were unlawfully imprisoned had sought to challenge the unlawfulness of their custody before the High Court said it was unlawful.

         The scrutiny of bills committee comprehensively rejected all of those arguments for the following reasons in particular. The first reason was that unlawful imprisonment carries the right to just compensation and therefore the concept of windfall has no application. The committee said that the second argument encroaches on the basic right of those subject to the law to be entitled to know what the law says and to be treated according to what the law says as the courts declare it to mean. It said that the third matter does not overcome the fact that the right of a person to challenge the unlawful excess of authority does not take away the obligation of a person exercising that authority to ensure that the use of that authority is within power.

Because the sole purpose of the bill is to defeat the challenge under section 54RA, it was seen, firstly, to distort the relationship between the legislative and judicial arms of government; secondly, to strike at the very basis of argument that the common law provides adequate protection against the infringement by government of civil liberties; and, thirdly, to condone and entrench the proposition that, wherever unlawful administrative action has been taken, the parliament may act retrospectively to cure it.

         The Law Council rejected outright the government's argument that the bill is merely curative. As I said earlier, the Solicitor-General has apparently also raised similar doubts. I point out to the government that the claim that at the time of the unlawful detention the minister and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs thought the law gave them power to detain these people is open to serious question. An internal departmental memo, dated 27 June 1992, presented in evidence to the constitutional and legal affairs committee expressed the view that the destruction of the vessels on which asylum seekers arrived would be likely to result in automatic ceasing of custody, as defined in section 88, leading to an order for release by a court.

         The bill is retrospective. On the government's own admission, the bill has been introduced solely to make lawful that which is now unlawful. The bill has nothing to do with ongoing detention. That was settled back in May 1992. The bill breaches basic principles of law. It is certain that the bill, if passed, will be challenged. Even the Solicitor-General acknowledges that such a challenge could be successful. The Law Council's arguments, I think, back that up very substantially.

         The financial implications of this matter cannot be estimated with any certainty. It is thought that there could be around 350 persons potentially eligible for compensation if the High Court upholds the challenge to section 54RA to include those who have returned to their home countries. However, it is likely that the actual numbers will be fewer. The estimates vary as to the likely compensation payments. One extreme upper figure is $200,000. If this were the average and, say, 300 people receive that amount, then we are talking about $60 million. Those figures are just an exaggeration for the purposes of trying to persuade people that there is a lot at stake. It is virtually certain that the amount will be significantly less. The number of applicants is likely to be fewer than 300 and I would say that the average compensation is likely to be very much less.

         If the government's arguments about the justice of these cases are right, I think the court would be very mindful to go for the same sorts of figures that we suggested were appropriate. People were kept for a dollar a day and were well provided for. The detention centres certainly were not gaols but were specially designed for this purpose. We would hope that, in dealing with these matters, the courts would have regard to what the parliament considers suitable compensation rather than taking into account any of these extreme ideas about what might be appropriate—even if the court takes the view that the provisions in section 54RA were not a valid enactment because of the constitution.

         Many of the possible claimants are now back in their country of origin after having had their claims for refugee status rejected. The relative living costs in a country such as Cambodia ought to be taken into account. The government argues that this bill is on all fours with those the coalition previously supported. I confirm, unequivocally, that that is not so. The bill is totally retrospective. It is one which we would not have agreed to, and did not agree to, back in 1992 when I was having negotiations with Mr Hand on the matter.

         —I rise to speak on the Migration Legislative Amendment (No. 3) Bill. It is informative to consider the evolution of this legislation and the way in which the opposition has dug itself into a hole. The legislation is before the parliament today because of the case of Chu Kheng Lim v. the Minister for Immigration. The essential decision in that case was that the parliament, representing the people of Australia, had been incorrect in believing that a number of people were legally detained between 1989 and 1992. That is essentially what this legislation is about.

         The government has been under the impression that these people were detained legally. We have been told today that this legislation finds its derivation in the stowaway legislation. However, whilst I acknowledge that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has provided advice and counsel and he has `been associated with the utmost cooperation in endeavouring to get a bipartisan policy in this area', I do not recall him indicating very strongly to this parliament that there were difficulties with this legislation. It is all very well to say in hindsight that the government is trying to retrospectively fix the problem. Not too many experts were saying that the legislation was flawed.

         The situation is that those people have, on technical grounds, been found to have been illegally detained. From where does this illegality stem? The Australian people might consider that it stems from rather preposterous propositions. Essentially, if a boat is forfeit, is disease ridden or is not seaworthy and these people technically cannot be returned to that particular boat, they have been detained illegally. If a naval vessel picks up some boat people who are drowning at sea and brings them to Australia, and then the boat is sent overseas, the government is technically illegally detaining those people because we do not have that particular boat to take them back.

         That is the point from which this legislation derives: firstly, that they have been detained illegally; secondly, a doubt that section 54RA is legal in allowing those persons only $1 a day compensation because it is not just recompense for detention by the government. We have heard the argument that the government is the only body that will profit.

         The other interesting historic development is the evolution of the opposition's policy. It is all very well for the honourable member for Berowra to try to contrast the opposition's position today with its position when these measures came in. It is quite interesting to note that the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee, in its rarefied atmosphere, tried to incriminate the honourable member for Berowra for the reversal of the opposition policy. The committee quoted him as saying, `The legislation is prospective in its effect. We would not support, and have not supported, any proposals for validating unlawful detentions because we think that would be an inappropriate course.'

         That was a nice way of putting what the opposition was doing at that time. But what is the reality? It agreed that people who had been detained would get only one dollar a day in compensation. The opposition was, essentially, depriving them of rights—their rights to reasonable damages from their point of view today.

         It is all right for the member for Berowra to try to minimise the impact of this and say, `Oh, look, surely they are not going to get $100 million from the Australian taxpayers.' Of course they are not. Some of them have returned to Cambodia. Some of them are not going to take legal action against us. A variety of reasons are being put forward today as to why, supposedly, the amount of money they are going to get in damages is going to be close to a dollar a day. What a joke! It is a joke to suggest that the lawyers behind these people are undertaking this action and are pushing this to the line so thoroughly, and in a variety of measures, so that they will get damages that low.

People out there in the street look at damages cases these days and they see the reality of the payments that people receive in these cases.

         What we have, of course, is a severe reversal of the opposition's policy in this field. It has been a bipartisan issue. There has been a genuine endeavour by the opposition to work with the government to ensure that there is some integrity in our immigration laws; that we do have a procedure in this country—and it is a very liberal procedure, quite frankly, internationally—allowing a degree of administrative law and judicial access to people to make refugee claims. There has been bipartisan support. But what we are seeing here today is an attempt by the legal and constitutional affairs committee in the Senate to stress niceties, propriety and the evil of retrospectivity, to essentially grant people what will be a windfall—a lottery win.

         These measures are not to be seen by themselves as separate from the problems that the country faces. They have to be seen in the context of the overall international movement of people and the large numbers of people that would not be discouraged by decisions such as this to allow such compensation payments. We all know that for the moment the High Court has validated the detentions from 1992. But to give a signal out there that people can essentially illegally enter the country and then turn around and have damages claims is a wrong signal.

         As much as the government would prefer it, the problem presented by the boat people will not go away. If anything, as immigration department officials concede, while other Western nations tighten their refugee rules, Australia may receive more boat people, possibly as the paying customers of Asian organised crime syndicates, which are believed to be behind the trade in the United States from southern China.

        Another interesting article was by Gary Freeman in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science in July 1994 where he questioned the ability of liberal democracies to actually contain the international movement of people. He stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The politics of immigration is strongly cyclical. State policies are highly variable in terms of their objectives and intensity. Since 1989, public attention has been riveted on migration problems and states have been developing responses at a frenetic pace, but this is highly unusual. More commonly, states allow migration problems to accumulate and migration control policies to flounder until rising public pressure or some crisis makes action unavoidable.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the context in which the opposition wants to give a signal out there to the Australian electorate and to those people who would attempt to illegally enter the country. He further stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The long-term trend is undeniably toward greater, not less, government effort and capacity to control international migration. This has to be qualified, of course, by recognition of rising pressures for migration around the world, advances in the technologies of travel and communication, and evolving domestic and international norms and rules that assert the individual human rights of migrants and refugees against the prerogatives of sovereign states.
       </para>
       <para>
        Essentially that is the opposition's position. For all the rhetoric we have heard from those opposite over the last decade about the industrial relations club—how associated groups have a vested interest in breaking down awards and conditions in this country—we do not hear too much from them about the migration relations club in this country. We are now seeing the opposition's associations through this obvious attempt to undermine the government's position on illegal migration. He further stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        That is the context in which we are talking about this bill today. So much for all the opposition's past bipartisan support. The previous shadow minister, the member for Berowra, has been walked over in regard to this measure. He has been put in a corner where he cannot dissociate himself from the decision of these senators. It is all right for them. They are very closeted and very removed from the reality out there in the electorate and the concerns of people about the failure, as they perceive it, of the government to have controls over entry into this country. Essentially they are shackling the member for Berowra to a policy that endangers the credibility of our policies.

         The essential ingredient in this provision is to legitimise the detentions that have occurred and to say that the government acted in good faith.

         As I said earlier today, this legislation would legitimise the detention of people who unlawfully enter the country. The proposed new section 4A provides that where a particular section can be read as being valid or invalid, the valid alternative will be pursued. Section 35, new subsection 1A, provides that a vessel will be required to travel to port and a person to remain on the vessel until it arrives at the port. This will stop lawyers—who might see a degree of compensation for themselves at the end of the road—using a technicality to make the standing provision invalid.

         That is essentially what has been done here. As was said earlier, this was done by relying on a line of American tax decisions. Judges have in a variety of cases indicated that they will allow curative legislation to endeavour to fix this matter. Some of the cases obviously are quite similar. From recollection, one of them involved a windfall payment of $100 million to a few pathologists on another technicality that the Australian taxpayers would be asked to rectify.

We face enormous long-term pressures on this matter. For the opposition to come here and strategically undermine the credibility of that policy by going out and advertising very strongly that there are windfall payments to be made here is damnable.

One of those Cambodians, Mr Ly, currently has an action in the High Court relating to his detention in Australia.

         The boat people also sought orders that they be released from custody. Two days before the custody hearing, parliament passed the Migration Amendment Act 1992. The act received the royal assent on 6 May 1992, the day before the custody hearing. The amending act inserted a new division 4B into the Migration Act. Division 4B provides, among other things, for the compulsory detention in custody of certain non-citizens who come within the definition of a `designated person'. It was clear that as from 6 May 1992, detention of the boat people was lawful by reason of the Migration Amendment Act. The custody applications were adjourned. Then the detainees mounted a challenge in the High Court to certain provisions of division 4B. Except for section 54R, which is not presently relevant, the validity of the sections were upheld.

         The case was called Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and is reported in volume 176 of the Commonwealth Law Reports. In Lim's case the High Court strongly suggested that before 6 May 1992 detention of the boat people under section 88 was unlawful. This was because the period of custody for the detention of illegal immigrants to Australia authorised by section 88 was merely a transitory one pending the departure of the relevant boat after a temporary visit to a port or ports in Australia. The result, said the majority of the High Court, was that the continued detention of a boat person in custody after the destruction of the boat on which he or she arrived in Australia was unlawful. This left the way open for some 88 of the affected people to launch common law actions for damages for false imprisonment for their period of unlawful detention.

         Mr Ly is now challenging the constitutional validity of section 54RA. Among other things, this bill seeks to repeal section 54RA. The High Court was due to hear Mr Ly's action tomorrow but due to the introduction of this bill by the government the case has been deferred to April next year. Mr Ly is claiming: firstly, that his detention before 6 May 1992 was unlawful; and, secondly, that the government's attempt to legislatively restrict the damages payable for that unlawful detention to compensation of $1 a day is unconstitutional and invalid. The main basis for the claim is that the reduction of the claim for damages is an acquisition of property without just terms contrary to section 51(xxxi) of the constitution.

         In March of this year the High Court gave judgment in four cases concerning the acquisition power. In one of the decisions, the court decided that extinguishing a cause of action for damages against the Commonwealth in tort amounts to an acquisition for the purposes of section 51(xxxi). On the basis of that decision, the Solicitor-General has given a written opinion that section 54RA will be declared invalid. The Solicitor-General is of the view, however, that an amendment to the Migration Act that operates retrospectively to cure the deficiency in section 88 may be held to be valid by the High Court. That amendment would make prior unlawful detention lawful. This bill seeks to amend section 88 to that effect.

The government's justification for the retrospective amendments glosses over the fact that the amendments fundamentally change the legal operation of the section. The proposed amendments would make formerly unlawful actions of the immigration department lawful.

         The proposed amendment gives rise to the question of whether the parliament will be repeatedly asked to make up for the incompetence of the immigration department in its inability to read and apply what, on the face of it, is a fairly straightforward piece of legislation. The Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee has examined this proposed retrospective legislation in the context of its examination of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). In its submission to the Senate committee in July of this year, the Administrative Law Committee of the Law Council of Australia said that if the parliament were regularly to act retrospectively to cure what is nothing less than unlawful administrative action, that would destroy, or at least significantly diminish, the Commonwealth administrative law system.

         The government has continued to describe the bill as `curative'. This is not the case. It is suggested that curative legislation to destroy a cause of action which would otherwise exist is not necessarily unconstitutional. I have said that to claim that the legislation rectifies a technical breach disguises the real effect of the amendment. `Curative' refers to a law which retrospectively corrects defects subsequently discovered in the law—or its administration—which restores what was previously thought by the relevant parties to be the status quo.

It is one thing retrospectively to legislate to validate the collection of a tax; it is quite another to legislate to make lawful a detention that would otherwise be unlawful and thus destroy a right to common law damages.

         Supporters of the bill also say that the validity of detention under section 88 was never challenged by lawyers for the detainees until the High Court's comments on the section in 1992. This objection, obviously, has no basis in any legal or moral principle. As revealed in the evidence given to the Senate committee, the reason there was no challenge is partly that the detainees had very limited access to legal advice. When they were finally able to consult lawyers, the lawyers understandably concentrated on applications for refugee status without looking at the wider question of the legality of the detention under section 88.

        From the first boat load in 1989, Australia's refugee processing system was tested. Refugee applications were lodged a month after their arrival.

A third boat of 79 Cambodians arrived in June 1990 and took more than a year to lodge refugee applications in November 1991. The lawyers and others, including people from church groups, then had the hide to blame the government for the largely engineered delay.

         Almost inevitably, the government backed down with the Cambodians. On 19 October 1993, Senator Bolkus announced a special assistance category for Cambodians with Australian links. These Australian links extend to those who illegally landed in this country by boat and who have repeatedly failed in their applications for refugee status while being detained at Port Hedland and also in Sydney and Melbourne. It also extends to those who chose earlier return to Cambodia. This opens the way for permanent residence. However, a qualifying period of 12 months in Cambodia is necessary before residence is granted. Most of these people from the camps who have consistently claimed that they are afraid to return to Cambodia have already done so in order to qualify under these conditions.

Having failed to do that, they then applied to the courts to allow the release into the community of the boat people pending the result of their applications. The May law was passed in response and this was challenged by the lawyers. Then on the basis of the High Court decision they claimed compensation.

         All this manipulation of the system has cost and is costing the Australian taxpayer a fortune. So the lawyer spivs have had the gall to attempt to parasite more money off the Australian taxpayer in the name of people whom they have helped cynically to manipulate the system. What an opportunity for fake refugees—simply turn up in Australia uninvited, hire lawyers, spivs, at public expense, clog up the system and then claim damages for unlawful detention. If this succeeds, it will send a great signal to potential fake refugees and the criminals and sharp operators who deal in shipping them from country to country. The bleeding hearts here will effectively be assisting the criminal people smugglers. That is what their good intentions will lead to.

It is clear that the soft approach taken in the past has made things worse, not better, and that countries such as Australia have in many cases been played for fools.

Unpalatable as the government's actions in relation to the asylum seekers are to some sections of the community—those members of the community who are genuinely concerned about human rights and Australia's international obligations—the government has taken a course of action to which there was no alternative. The government should be commended. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) mentioned the previous minister, Mr Hand, who, along with the current Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), should be commended for his leadership in relation to this matter.

         Today's display by the coalition shows to what depths it is sinking. The little leadership it has displayed in the past seems to have completely disappeared under the leadership of Alexander Downer. It is typical of the coalition these days that it simply does not stick to any principle or policy. It just plays to the crowd, although I do not know to what crowd it is playing in relation to this matter. I will get back to that later. That certainly seems to be the coalition's motivation.

         The coalition's attitude to this bill is both cynical and hypocritical. It is a breach of the bipartisan approach to immigration that has occurred in this place almost since the 1940s. There was a little blip when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was leader of the coalition, but certainly there has been bipartisanship. I suppose that we are now getting back into that Howard period, with sniping from the coalition, which is playing to the crowd—to a section of the community.

         The focus of this bill is to retrospectively alter the Migration Act 1958 to provide a legal basis for the detention of certain people who arrived in Australia by boat without authorisation and who may have been detained unlawfully. From 1989, the number of unauthorised asylum seekers that have come to Australia, particularly by boat, seems to have increased greatly. From the figures that I have, from 28 November 1989 to 27 January 1994, 18 such boats have come to Australia with 735 people. Recent interpretations of section 36 of the act—now section 88 of the act—in the Chu Kheng Lim case and Lek's case seem to suggest that the detention of those asylum seekers was unlawful.

         The effect of this bill is to ensure that, from 1 November 1989, section 36—or what is now section 88—of the act authorises custody, for a finite period, of people who arrive without lawful authority on board a vessel that subsequently is unable to leave Australia because it has been destroyed or is no longer seaworthy, has been impounded or forfeited, has sunk, or is otherwise reasonably assumed to be unable to depart.

         In some cases, the vessel upon which a person arrives at a port in Australia may not be the same vessel in which the person left another country. I think the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) mentioned the case of an Australian patrol vessel, say, picking up a sinking boat and rescuing those people. This could occur; indeed, I am told it did occur, which technically meant that there was some sort of unlawful detention. The understanding of the minister and the department is that in such circumstances section 36, now section 88, authorised the custody of a person for a period which is not limited, by reference to when the vessel on which the person arrived was next leaving Australia.

         I do not know what the coalition is on about in this matter. The bill is a retrospective bill. It not only retrospectively validates what may be an invalid detention but also relates to the question of compensation. There was a proposition for $1 a day compensation. There is some suggestion that, as a result of the Georgiadis case, that could no longer be sustained constitutionally, so the government has reacted and has retrospectively validated the bill. This is where the coalition is hypocritical. It supported the $1 a day compensation proposal but it does not support the retrospective validation of the bill. This is simply a reflection of the will of the people of Australia and it is beyond me why the coalition would oppose it.

The integrity of Australia's immigration policy has to be backed up by creating a disincentive for illegal entry. As I said earlier, the coalition is cynical and hypocritical on this issue. Its cynicism, I predict, will bring it unstuck because the vast majority of Australian people support the government on this issue.

Secondly, I understand that the coalition has called for a mini-budget to re-examine the government's fiscal policy. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out in question time, coalition spokespersons are continually going around the country supporting big ticket items of expenditure. This is a big ticket item because we are talking about $100 million. But what is the coalition's priority in relation to these matters?

That would be more sensible than this approach. Perhaps we could spend this $100 million to assist Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It has been said by numerous speakers in this debate that because of a technicality the government has to act on this matter; however, the coalition wants to throw away almost $100 million.

         As we know, the problem that this legislation is a further attempt to rectify arises from the arrival in 1989 and subsequently of so-called boat people. These people were, as has been described, predominantly Cambodian but also Chinese and Vietnamese. They arrived on our shores in boats with no valid entry documentation. On arrival on our shores, they sought asylum by asking the Australian government to consider their status as refugees.

         It is acknowledged that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who leads for the opposition, has a very particular interest in this matter. Whilst he has annoyed subsequent ministers with his determination to take up points about this matter, I do not think anybody questions his determination to ensure that the system is proper, protects the rights of those making application for asylum but, in doing so, protects the rights of the wider Australian community and the expectations of the Australian community. In an article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Bulletin
         </emphasis>
         in July 1993, Laurie Oakes quoted the member for Berowra as saying:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is absolutely no doubt that Australia has in place the Rolls-Royce administrative arrangements for determining refugee claims.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member made those comments in 1992. The year 1992 is germane to this debate. In another interview, Oakes quoted the honourable member for Berowra as saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I see nothing wrong with detaining people if they arrive clandestinely.

        He added that Australia must not show itself to be a "soft touch" by treating boat people too leniently.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is in the context of those sentiments that the government has, as echoed by the honourable member for Berowra, tried to work its way through what has become a legal minefield and to properly deal with matters that have arisen out of the arrangements dating back to 1989 concerning what to do with these boat people.

         Having had the determination of the High Court in the Lim case, indicating the problems with section 88, attempts were made to rectify the situation. New division 4B was enacted to cover the subsequent custody of these people and at the same time, as the honourable member for Berowra has said, there was an attempt in the Migration Amendment Bill (No.4) 1992 to quantify damages. Under section 54RA, there was a statutory cap placed on the amount of compensation that was to be made available to those who had been determined as being detained unlawfully as a result of the interpretation of section 88. What has to be emphasised about that aspect of the legislation—and it had the support of the opposition—is that it says:

        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        So in this provision the date of 19 November 1989 is important. This legislation was enacted in December 1992. What was the intent of it? It was to limit the compensation—to backdate something that affected these people and to reduce what was potentially seen as a bill for the Australian people of approximately $100 million. The honourable member for Berowra—he may have been the honourable member for Dundas then, I am not too sure—had this to say on 16 December 1992 in the debate on that legislation:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is the potential for substantial claims for compensation.
       </para>
       <para>
        At that time we agreed that part of the intent of the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992 was to limit the compensation; it would affect the potential rights of the people covered by the decision of the High Court in the Lim case. Now we have further legal opinion that, in fact, section 54RA may have some constitutional problem.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So we are back to square one on the question of compensation. Why today, nearly two years on, does the opposition suddenly wish to capitulate on taking action that will limit the compensation and bring back the situation that we had before December 1992? This is a contradiction that defies explanation. In December 1992 it was quite willing to be involved in what was thought the appropriate action to limit the compensation. I might remind the honourable member for Berowra that both the government and the opposition at that time thought it was valid. He made some comments on people's ability to foresee what they should have seen as obvious about interpretations of the law. But in that case, all sides of this place thought that this was a valid way of limiting the compensation. So we should not go around crowing that, in a lot of these aspects, we as legislators clearly understood what the effect of the legislation was. That was the point that I made from the outset in this contribution: this illustrates the difficulty that we have, as legislators, of ensuring that what we are attempting to do is so reflected in the legislation.

         Now we return with this piece of legislation, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994, to effect the exact change that we attempted to effect back in 1992. It is on that basis that I find it extraordinary that the opposition should adopt the position that it has. There has been discussion about curative legislation and about our ability to use such types of legislation. But from my understanding—albeit that, as a legislator without legal training, I have to rely on the opinion of others—there is opinion that we have the legal right to take the action that we are taking. That is why we should support it. It rectifies a situation that everybody in good faith thought applied to the treatment of those that arrived in the boats in 1989. That was subsequently shown not to be the case. This has resulted in the changes to the legislation that we are now seeing today.

         If we are to have an approach that is seen by all as ensuring the integrity of our form of assessment in determining people's status as refugees or not, this legislation needs support. My colleagues have outlined a number of the reasons. Some of my colleagues such as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) have been more colourful than others about the legal profession, but it is well understood that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has held the views that he espoused today for a very long time. Whilst I would not dare to go to the extent that he did today, one has to worry about the intent of those that have, I suspect in part with good intention, invoked every piece of legal `trickery' that is available. Back in 1992, when we were discussing the length of time that was taken to make the assessments about the status of these detainees, one of the problems was government inaction, but the major problem was the innumerable legal interventions made on behalf of the detainees.

         If we are to be seen as a government that has perhaps the conflicting aims of recognising the rights of those who land on our shores and who seek the status of asylum in having their status acknowledged as refugees, we should do that in a way that has the highest regard to the rights of those people. At the same time, we should ensure that our system has the highest degree of integrity and is seen by the wider Australian community as a system that acknowledges not only the rights of the non-citizens—aliens—who arrive but also the rights of Australian citizens, the rights of those who try to get out of the camps into our refugee program and the rights of those others who nominate to migrate to this country on a permanent basis. I hope that, on reflection and on further discussion amongst the opposition parties, when this bill gets to the Senate, there might be a reconsideration and opposition members might see their way clear to support a piece of legislation that has very honourable intent.

         —in reply—Since the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 was introduced by me on behalf of the government, I feel that I am justified in replying to a number of statements that have been made in the House today. At the outset, I would particularly like to congratulate and commend the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) for their contributions. In so doing, I would like to acknowledge that a number of them have already stated before the House their clear understanding and appreciation of why the government has brought in this bill.

         In the time available to me, I would like to touch on a couple of the comments made by the honourable member for Berowra. I do so because, while other speakers have already said that they have supported legislation in the past, I can honestly say that the opposition stance is not only irresponsible but hypocritical. The opposition cannot on one hand support legislation brought into this House in May 1992 and December 1992 very clearly to prevent a windfall in compensation and then, under the then leadership of the honourable member for Berowra when he was the shadow spokesperson for immigration, say that it supports limiting the payout of any damages to $1 per day. That legislation that was debated, reported, recorded—
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         very clearly shows it—and supported by the opposition was retrospective. It was retrospective because it selectively provided a compensation payment to a number of boat people. Yet now we have before the House opposition members refusing to agree to legislation which is aimed at supporting the Commonwealth in any claim by the boat people.

         I suggest to opposition members that, when we have hypocrisy like this, they come out very clearly and state why. Two speakers on the government benches stated what it was all about. It is about three newcomers—two of them, particularly—trying to put their imprimatur on legislation that perhaps escaped them in the past. I will not name those people from the other place, because I would not like to do them a disservice or be unjust in my criticism of them, but I think that all of us appreciate and understand—and I am sure that the shadow spokesperson for social security, the honourable member for Berowra, would realise it as well—the time and energy that was spent in coming together and getting opposition agreement to legislation in this House. Yet we now have this hypocritical approach where all of a sudden a Senate select committee looked at the legislation and decided it wanted to bring new clauses or readings into it.

         Opposition members in that committee claimed that their legal advice was that the bill would be constitutionally invalid. Actually, the honourable member for Tangney got up at the same time and said that. I can assure the House that the government's legal advice was based on the fact that recent High Court decisions made available to the opposition are strongly to the contrary. The government would not have introduced this legislation to the House today if it thought otherwise.

         The purpose of this bill is simply to return the law to what the parliament—supported by the opposition—the department and all other parties thought it to be. That is the intent now. The opposition particularly knows that curative legislation such as we have brought before the House today does have precedence, here and in the United States.

         The honourable member for Berowra went on to talk about detention. This bill is not about detention. In fact, it has nothing to do with the appropriateness of detaining unauthorised arrivals while their claims for refugee status are being assessed. The only period for detention which is relevant to the present bill is that between the arrival of the first of the current wave of boat people, which was in November 1989, and May 1992. That is when the boat people ceased to be held under section 88, then section 36, of the act. It is this period on which the High Court has now cast doubt because of the construction of section 88. We just cannot have it both ways. We are now seeing the opposition, two years later, deciding it is going to fly another flag. After consultation and acceptance, it has now decided it is going to take another approach. Well, that is not on.

        primary objective in proposing the bill is to avoid the possibility of the Australian taxpayer underwriting compensation payments which would be the nature of windfalls to certain unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia.

       <para>
        That is what the bill is about. Statements were made by the honourable member for Berowra. I think he asked: why do we not negotiate with the boat people? As the law currently stands, the parliament has indicated that it believes the boat people who are claiming compensation should receive at the most a nominal amount of $1 a day for the period from December 1989 to May 1992. This was supported by the opposition but now it says, `We cannot have retrospective legislation.' The government remains committed to the principle behind section 54RA. However, the High Court's recent decisions on the acquisition powers have cast doubt on the lawfulness of this section and that is why we have this supportive legislation.

         It cannot be seriously argued that when the opposition supported the $1 a day provision the legislation was not retrospective. It was retrospective. Section 54RA denies any claim for compensation for past wrongful detention and substitutes a statutory scheme limiting any compensation to $1 per day. So it was there. It was laid out. It was debated. It was agreed upon.

         Suddenly the opposition is stating that there is new light on the scene. There is a new person, a new shadow spokesman, and he wants to put his imprimatur on it. And, of course, the opposition has changed its shadow Attorney-General. Its former shadow Attorney-General has gone to the back bench. Its new shadow Attorney-General, in the other place, wants to bring in a different version of legal advice—which, I might add, is legal advice that has never been supplied to us and never been validated.

         We are not asking the opposition to embrace retrospectivity. We are asking for support for this  legislation and support for commonsense. Quite frankly, the opposition, in departing from support for this bill, is really stating that it does not care what it costs the Australian taxpayer. It does not care what it is going to cost this government if at any time we have to make payments of large amounts of compensation—assessed by one of the advisers to the boat people as in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars. That is not an assessment made by us but by them, but that is all right. The opposition is stating that our government and our budget can stretch not to the farmers of Australia, not to the areas that the member for Leichhardt touched on, but to compensation because suddenly the opposition decides that it needs to make new input into this legislation.

I think it is worthwhile that the public of Australia realise, understand and appreciate the hypocrisy of the opposition when what we have is legislation before this parliament to make sure that, in the light of any High Court decision, the government is backed up by legislation. It is hypocrisy because it is legislation that was agreed to originally though now the opposition says it cannot support it.

         The opposition believes that the High Court should never make political decisions. That was the case with Mabo, but that was right and proper. When the honourable members for Berowra and Tangney were called on to make a political decision, they said, `No, it can't be.' What we have had in the debate from these two opposition speakers is nothing but hypocrisy and absolute nonsense. I commend the bill to the House. I commend the speakers who supported the bill. I say to the honourable members for Berowra and Tangney that a bit of commonsense, rather than the type of hypocrisy that we have had to endure from their two statements, would go far.

I would have to say that I think the Prime Minister was merely reflecting what a great many other Australians think.

         Having said that, the Australian government has made its position very clear on this issue and we will continue, as we have said several times in the last few days, to monitor what is going on in the Gulf area. We are obviously monitoring the various reports that we are receiving about the concentration of Iraqi troops on the border with Kuwait.

         We welcome the announcement made today by the Iraqi ambassador in the United Nations indicating that Iraq would withdraw some of its troops on the border, but we remain very concerned that evidence presented to the Security Council by the United States ambassador contradicts the Iraqi announcement showing, as it does, that such a withdrawal has not commenced. Nor, I am informed, is there any evidence from other sources confirming that an Iraqi withdrawal has begun.

         The Australian government has not been approached to contribute to the current defensive build-up in Kuwait. Therefore, as the Prime Minister noted yesterday, should such events unfold and a UN mandate response be initiated, the Australian government would most likely respond as we did in the Gulf crisis in 1991.

         Mr Speaker, to give you a demonstration of what has been happening, over the week to 4 October Qantas experienced its busiest week ever in its domestic operations, carrying close to 220,000 passengers in over 1,700 flights. Under this government, which allowed Qantas and Australian Airlines to merge, we have the sight of Qantas 747s flying from domestic terminal to domestic terminal, obviously dramatically increasing the capacity of Qantas to handle the peak periods in the airline industry. I am pleased to say that Ansett also had a record week, which is further good news for the hotels and other tourism businesses.

Last year we had a massive number of people, 20 million passengers, flying throughout the year. That is a 50 per cent increase on the number of people who were flying three years ago. The Tourism Forecasting Council is suggesting that there will be a two per cent growth in tourism in domestic travel. That has got to be a good thing for the tourism industry when you realise that the domestic tourism industry makes up about 80 per cent of the expenditure on businesses throughout the tourism industry and throughout the Australian economy.

         The resources and the government's policies in tourism have sought to give this industry the recognition that it deserves. We have even had members of the opposition saying that they believe that the government's policies were working. For example, on Queensland radio this morning Senator Macdonald said that the government's regional tourism development program was one of the government's better programs, that it was a step in the right direction and that it would particularly help small localities. Senator Macdonald is obviously catching up with people such as the honourable member for Herbert and others who have been sounding the good news about this program for some time now; it is good to see Senator Macdonald catching up.

The only worry is that next time we attend a conference which Senator Parer addresses he might be talking about the colour of the flight attendants' uniforms, the state of the footpaths or some other big issue that we need to address.

         . It says a few things. It says the Leader of the Opposition will ensure that tourism is fully acknowledged as one of the key industries in the economy. The first decision the Leader of the Opposition took was to downgrade tourism, to put tourism outside the shadow cabinet. Is it any wonder that people are concluding that the opposition is full of rhetoric, but very short on promises and real funding commitments?

Why has the Prime Minister ditched the centrepiece of Labor's cultural policy at the last election—the national museum? Is the Prime Minister's decision to break his promise to the Australian people to establish a national museum borne of his determination to rewrite history and to distort our national heritage for his own political purposes? Does the minister agree with the chairperson of the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies that the decision is an act of grand larceny? Why has the Prime Minister treated the numerous Australians who donated artefacts for the national museum in good faith with utter contempt? And is it true that the government has already spent in excess of $10 million on this project to date?

At the last election the government said that it would provide $26 million for the construction of the national museum if the national museum could raise $26 million from the private sector. That commitment still stands and, if you listen very carefully, in the cultural policy statement we will outline a number of measures that will address this and other issues.

Yesterday, there was some more encouraging news on the job front. The ANZ job ads series showed that there had been a further increase of four per cent, taking the number of job advertisements to the highest level in more than four years.

         Clearly this government is achieving strong economic growth, in excess of 4 1/2 per cent, which is translating into strong job growth—job growth, I might say, of between 3 1/2 and four per cent. Importantly in relation to the honourable member's question, we are also picking up the long-term unemployed in this job growth. The ABS in its most recently published statistic puts the level of long-term unemployed at 290,000—the lowest in 31 months. This is very good news on the job front. The government's strategy is working. This good news was acknowledged all around the country on TV last night and in the newspapers today—all around the country, that is, except for the opposition.

Not only is he talking down the significance of yesterday's good news but also is he suggesting that the government has done nothing. The government has introduced a package of measures committing $10.3 billion over the next four years. There is no complacency on this side.

         The fact of the matter remains that, in terms of the table he put out purporting to say that we were behind target and that all we had achieved within two months of the release of the white paper was 36,000 placements, the true figure is in fact in excess of 100,000 placements.

         —Yes, I can. As the honourable member may be aware, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures put out a document a day or so ago which talked of the best Christmas in five years and a survey of its membership which ascertained what its intentions were for the period up to Christmas. Nine in every 10 companies surveyed expected to maintain or further increase production and sales in the lead-up to Christmas. Thirty per cent of the companies planned to increase investment and 22 per cent planned to increase jobs.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Yesterday's ANZ job vacancy figures certainly bear out that buoyant outlook. Export prospects are the highest for the year. Thirty-two per cent of companies expect them to grow, with only five per cent expecting a fall. The ACM survey states:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        cannot be understated because they are off an already high base . . . The figures indicate that manufacturers are not switching export sales back into the domestic market. With intense international competition the norm, Australian manufacturers are refusing to give up overseas markets once they are captured.
       </para>
       <para>
        This again bears very good news for our current account. It is interesting that not only the participants of the survey by the Chamber of Manufactures but also some commentators who accused the government during the presentation of the budget earlier in the year of inflating their public expectations of what business investment would likely be and who came in with estimates lower than ours are now accusing us of suppressing what the likely level of business investment is going to be during the year and are saying that we got our figures wrong—not on the upward side, which was the accusation of five or six months ago, but on the downward side. So there is some sweet justice in the level of complaint that is being directed at us now.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The estimates of the Chamber of Manufactures are of a piece with the September quarter business survey reports of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Westpac that the net balance of manufacturers planning an increase in plant and equipment investment over the next 12 months is at the highest level since December 1988. It is of a piece with the September quarter 1994 survey of the Metal Trades Industry Association, which also contains information on positive investment intentions by members. The Institute of Directors-KPMG Peat Marwick September quarter 1994 survey paints a similarly buoyant picture for investment, but it also reveals that 96 per cent of the planned investment will be targeted within Australia.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So all those figures added up together bear out what the government put forward as its anticipation for the year—that business investment is going into the areas that we most want it to in dealing with any current account problems and in providing employment.

         The employment statistics—another area where we are now accused by some of those who said we were too optimistic of having depressed the figures—are being enhanced in the way in which the Prime Minister pointed out, probably uniquely a percentage point growth in employment with every percentage point growth in GDP. That is a level of achievement of employment growth that is not replicated at least among the European members of the OECD. So the Chamber of Manufactures survey is, as I said at the outset, yet another example of good news coming through.

I ask the minister: have you sanctioned the fudging of statistics to make it look as though targets are being met? Will you now investigate these claims?

         The move to the north is a very essential and critical part of the defence plan by this government that has been adopted over a good deal of time, with its roots in the 1987 white paper. As the honourable member would know, for that move to be successful it would depend, in no small part, on how well and how quickly we can provide housing for our defence personnel and their families. I am pleased to inform the House that the Defence Housing Authority has recently been able to negotiate some very innovative solutions to housing issues in the north—both in Townsville, the honourable member for Herbert's electorate, and in Darwin, the honourable member for the Northern Territory's electorate.

Honourable members, especially the member for Herbert, would be aware of the scarcity of residential tracts of land available to us. It is pertinent to point out that, if the authority had not purchased The Willows, we would have been fully reliant on the local housing market and we ourselves would have been bidding up the price of what we were seeking to buy.

In Darwin, in the member for the Northern Territory's electorate, the Northern Territory government has signed an option agreement which will enable the authority to develop a new major residential estate at Palmerston in the southern suburbs of Darwin. While the deal is subject still to evaluation and final negotiations, if ratified it will lead to a residential estate of upwards of 1,000 blocks.

The honourable member raises the issue of the decision made at the national conference of the Labor Party to compel a process whereby, by the turn of the century or just after, 35 per cent of Labor candidates in winnable seats will be women. That addresses probably the most substantial inequity in representation that exists in this chamber.

         The fact is that the preselection processes of all our political parties have manifestly failed to recognise that there is merit in the female part of the population. You cannot seriously sustain an argument that merit is reflected in terms of membership of this chamber when 10 per cent of its occupants are women. If you wish to argue that, that involves you in a series of arguments that basically disappeared from party and political discourse 50 years ago. The fact is that, while those arguments may have disappeared from political discourse 50 years ago, there is a requirement upon political parties to do something about this.

         The Labor Party has taken an intelligent decision not only to set itself that target but also to impose on itself some forms of discipline in enabling us to reach that target. I would have thought that this would be a matter of some interest and joy to the honourable member, and that it would be a process and a result that he would now wish to see the party conferences on the National Party and the party conferences of the Liberal Party aiming to achieve. If there is a failure in any section of the political process to recognise the fact that any merit based preselection system must throw up something that roughly apportions seats to the gender balance of the population, no doubt through time that section will suffer politically for it.

I am pleased to be able to tell the House that while a report of the study's results is not due to be released until early next year I understand that, of the 25 institutions that it will single out as case studies in educational best practice, five are Australian schools. Reports indicate that Cherrybrook Technology High School in Sydney, Emmanuel College in Adelaide, the Tea Tree Gully College of TAFE in Adelaide, the Methodist Ladies College in Melbourne and OTEN, the Open Training and Education Network which broadcasts to some 60,000 students in Sydney, have all been selected as examples of best practice for the study.

         I need hardly point out to the House what a spread of institutions that is, covering government, non-government, secondary, post-secondary, single gender and coeducational institutions, and even an institution which broadcasts by satellite and video. The education systems in Australia attract more than their fair share of knockers—people who are quick to point out how their individual expectations are being disappointed in one particular school or another. It may take an outsider such as the compiler of this study, Professor Susan Steubing of the United States, to recognise the strengths that exists within our systems and to remind Australians, particularly the knockers—particularly some of those opposite—that our standards compare extremely well with those around the world.

         Overseas students and their parents are well aware of the quality of education in this country. Australia is pre-eminent within the Asia-Pacific region as the country of choice for education. Parents seeking a place to educate their children choose Australian schools and colleges ahead of those in any other part of the region. The OECD study will show that there is good reason for that choice, particularly in technological education. Technological change has been a dominant characteristic of the world, particularly the Asia-Pacific region, over the past decade. As a result, technological education has been a field of great development.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his interest in the coal industry. I released on Sunday results of a major study on coal and climate change. The study examines the positive contribution Australia's coal industry can make to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with coal use, particularly in developing countries in our region. The central focus of the study is the identification of initiatives that Australia can develop to reduce coal related greenhouse gas emissions. Any business for Australian industry from these initiatives will be important additions to Australia's existing coal export trade.

         The study also recognises the key role coal would play in meeting the expanding energy needs of developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Coal is critical to the development of many countries in the region and it would not be possible for them to develop without the use of more coal; therefore, abandoning the use of coal is not an option. What we need to do is use coal more wisely and cleanly. There are a range of initiatives which could deliver significant, substantial greenhouse emission reductions. They include upgrading industrial boilers, improving power station efficiency, washing indigenous coals, coal bed methane drainage and the supply of high grade Australian thermal coals.

         The study in particular is relevant to our international obligations under the framework of the convention on climate change. It will help us to identify opportunities for joint implementation activities to reduce greenhouse emissions under the convention. For example, just upgrading the industrial boilers in China will reduce CO(2) emissions by some 81 million tonnes per year. That is equivalent to nearly 15 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. Building coal washeries would reduce the often very high ash content of raw coal from Indian mines and increase power stations' thermal efficiency. India has identified this as a high priority as it is restructuring its coal industry to provide opportunity for private sector investment. Several Australian companies are already building washeries in India.

         Many times in the greenhouse debate there is concentration only on what Australia can do in Australia. What we really have to do is look at the regional area and look at what Australia can do to assist developing nations meet greenhouse emission reductions. If we are able to bring one Chinese power station into line with Australian standards, then all the incremental gains we could get out of greenhouse emission reductions in Australia would be met. Therefore, we do need to take a broader look when we talk about greenhouse emissions and the targets we need to reach.

I note that my friend and distinguished colleague, as well as distinguished surgeon, Senator John Herron has just returned from Rwanda where he did some very great and valuable work.

         In recent years, our military people have made very valuable commitments around the globe to our country's international standing in the cause of promoting peace and stability on the planet, and through our peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Cambodia and Somalia are two other examples. I think we can all be very proud of the splendid example that they are setting overseas.

        —Order! For the information of honourable members, I present a letter dated 10 October from the Hon. Trevor Morling, QC, Chairperson of the Australian Electoral Commission, together with a copy of a letter that I sent to the commissioner on 22 September. Honourable members may recall that on 20 September, the honourable member for Lalor raised as a matter of privilege actions allegedly taken by Australian Electoral Commission officers in Victoria concerning the hearing of evidence from members in respect of redistribution proposals.

That concept fell by the wayside but was picked up by Senator Richardson. He had the potential for investing in all sorts of things. He came to the party with a proposition that superannuation funds be directed towards investment in small projects and small and medium sized business.

But having come to this particular House, he has had the responsibility for running a number of ways in which he can get some notoriety. Firstly, we had the magnificent performance with ANL, a major government enterprise, in which the taxpayers of Australia had invested something like $160 million. It had been allowed to completely wither on the vine to such an extent that, when the government was called upon to privatise it by its own forces—and the government agreed to do so—the investigations that took place into that company revealed that, within it, it was not worth a cracker. To quote the minister, `You couldn't give it away.' Yet this particular minister a few weeks later said, `We'll keep a shareholding in it and we'll oblige superannuation contributors to subscribe to it along with a partner'—and the partner happens to be the maritime union. I think that is worth reflecting on.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the requirements with superannuation is that you, as a trustee, must act prudently with your investment. So, as a consequence of that, you are inviting, indeed, directing, under the terms of the proposals put forward by the ALP at its conference, the trustees of superannuation companies to break their commitment to their funds, to the people whom you have forced to contribute to the funds to invest in businesses about one of which you says, `You couldn't give it away.' That is the scandalous position which has arisen in Australia—absolutely scandalous. However, it does not stop there.

         We then pass on to the Federal Airports Corporation. Those who comprise the Right wing—and you are one of those—are all for selling off the Federal Airports Corporation. If you do not, you cannot balance the budget. So we go around to find some sort of a deal. You have to get them in. You cannot sell the freehold, so you will do a leasehold deal instead. That bought off the Left and made everybody feel happy over there. But to comply with that, you came up with the resolution which said that the tender documents must have in them a preference towards Australian superannuation companies. You then went on to say that you will do everything within your power to ensure that Australian superannuation funds are used. To go further, the trade unions said that their members' funds will be invested in it—their unions' funds. Industry superannuation—you will remember what it was all about. This lot brought it in so that they could give control of the funds to the trade unions themselves to invest in whatever way they wanted to.

         So what do we have as a consequence of this run around the block? We have the situation where people are compelled to invest six per cent of their salary in superannuation funds. The government says that some of those funds must invest in these particularly spurious investments—at the moment, the FAC and ANL propositions in particular. Then the government says that the trustees of those funds must act responsibly on behalf of their particular beneficiaries—a total conflict. The government then goes on from there to say to the nation, `Go out and invest in Asia,' but at the same time complains, `It sticks in my craw'—to quote the Minister for Transport—`that superannuation funds are investing outside Australia.' It sticks in his craw! I say: it sticks in the craw of Australian investors that people have to invest outside of Australia to get an appropriate return. The reasons for that are high interest rates, high unemployment, this nation's non-competitive labour market and industry which is falling into disrepute.

         I draw to your attention a couple of the comments of the industry itself. The people who manage these funds—about $150 billion to $160 billion at the moment—say that by the turn of the century something approaching $A600 billion will be invested in superannuation in this nation. It is a very attractive honey pot to the Labor Party, which simply loves spending other people's money—not its own, other people's. It is interesting to see the response that has come from some of the superannuation funds. Most notably, one should take some note of Susan Ryan, a former Labor minister, who had the following little pearls to utter:

        Public confidence is not high, people are unsure about where their money is going, who's looking after it, whether it will grow over the years to provide them a retirement income, whether the old age pension will be there if they don't save enough for themselves.

        She went on to say:

        That is not a bad serve from a former cabinet minister. She would know considerably of the personal likes and dislikes of members of the current government. When she responds that way to the proposals put forward to the Labor government at the annual conference, one should take note. It is also worth noting what Tony Cole said. He is the former Secretary to the Treasury. You would know, in Labor Party circles, what that means. He has been highly critical of proposals to direct superannuation money towards pet government projects. He said:

        If the Government wants to get superannuation funds into a particular sector it's got to look at what will be attractive to the private sector for investment in that area and not expect that it's going to be subsidised basically by fund members investing at a loss under direction from Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not bad for the former Secretary to the Treasury. On top of that, I can cite two unions which have directly expressed their concern at what would happen if their funds were allowed to be run by the government. Everybody knows that when the government goes picking winners the investor is on a loser. It has been proved over the years that governments pick losers. As a consequence, the people who run the funds are extraordinarily concerned as to what the outcome of it might be.

         The underlying problem confronting savings in Australia is the government's mismanagement of the economy. Savings in this nation are low because people have not got the confidence to invest in the long term. Essentially all superannuation funds are long-term investments. They cannot be short-term investments because of the size of the Australian market. As a consequence, they must take long-term views. When superannuation funds look at the Australian economy, with its boom-bust cycles, high interest rates, high unemployment and high consumer debt, they must wonder what the future holds for them. If you are stuck in a boom-bust cycle, no long-term investment is a viable proposition. You must of necessity be a short-term trader. As a consequence, the national interest will be sold out. It is no wonder the superannuation funds are looking offshore to put their money into places which have far better growth prospects.

         —After listening to the contribution by the member for Ryan (Mr Moore) on this matter of public importance, I think there are a few fundamental misunderstandings that need to be corrected at the outset. The first one is to note that he spent about 30 seconds on the opposition's policy in relation to superannuation. That is understandable because the key thing the opposition has said about the superannuation guarantee is that it would freeze it at the level it currently stands at, four to five per cent, were it to win the next election. So its first contribution to add to national savings is to freeze the superannuation guarantee.

         Already superannuation contribution savings represent about $190 billion to the Australian economy. Superannuation is a very significant contributor to national savings. It is by far the most significant contribution that has been made to national savings in decades and represents an important part of a comprehensive retirement incomes policy. Yet the opposition's approach is to freeze the guarantee. It seems it is hankering for the days when superannuation was the preserve of a few. When the Labor government came to office in 1983, superannuation coverage amounted to about 44 per cent of the work force. Now it stands at nearer 90 per cent.

         Particularly important in that consideration has been the fact that superannuation is now extended to a far greater range of people in the community, particularly women, lower paid part-time workers and so on, which is something the opposition's approach would seek to undermine. If ever there were a nonsense it would be the suggestion that there has been a politicisation of this issue by the government when every step of the way, in The Things That Matter and at the last election, the opposition went to the people suggesting that superannuation as a vehicle for savings should not be encouraged and that it would freeze the super guarantee arrangement either at three per cent or, as it rose, at whatever figure it was when it got to office. The people rejected that idea in the 1993 election. I suggest to the House that they will reject it again.

Unlike some of the tax switches that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and others have identified—the tax preferred arrangements for savings vehicles and those sorts of things which are not net contributors to national savings—we have the superannuation guarantee which ensures a real net contribution to national savings as well as adds to people's retirement incomes.

It is totally untrue to make such an assertion. It is absolutely wrong. The explicit resolution of the conference was that the FAC leasing arrangements will be by way of an open tender process.

         In relation to privatisation, such as that of the FAC, the government went through, in conjunction with the broader debate in the community, quite an extensive process of discussion to come up with the best regime in order to get the optimum value out of our airports in the future. The member for Ryan suggested as part of his contribution that the FAC arrangements were some sort of lemon and that this would be detrimental to and could jeopardise the superannuation funds. I think most would regard many of the airports as very attractive investment vehicles over time. With the range of measures the government adopted in relation to debt and with some of the investment that has occurred, there is every reason to believe many of those will be quite attractive to a range of investors.

         In a discussion I had with Tony Cole he made it clear to me that he felt an open competitive approach to the tender for the leases of the airports was quite an attractive way to approach this issue and that it would then be a matter for funds to make their own judgment about whether they should be involved and what sort of involvement they may have as part of the consortia that take an interest in those matters. The general feedback has been that people will weigh up the options in that area and make their open commercial judgments—and that is entirely appropriate, as it should be. The competitive process for the tender arrangement we have outlined ensures that it will be done in a clear and transparent way. That is the perfectly appropriate way to approach such matters.

We are also told that there is inadequate spending on infrastructure and that more needs to be done in that area.

         The government has taken a balanced approach with the assets it holds. It is ensuring that, where assets are in public ownership, we get the best results through competitive models such as in telecommunications. When we take steps to privatise assets, we do so in a way which ensures that they optimise their return to regions, such as regional airports can and should do. We say most definitively that the government has no plans or intentions of directing superannuation funds to invest in these areas. We are simply looking at having a balanced investment portfolio and, as part and parcel of that, are ensuring that we look at the potential spread and opportunities for investment in new areas such as infrastructure.

         —A couple of very salient points need to be highlighted and made quite clear to the people of Australia in the matter of public importance today. Firstly, the complete ineptitude of the government in dealing with the process of the privatisation of the FAC and the ultimate price it will get in selling a public asset that belongs to the taxpayers of Australia and not the government; and, secondly, the use of superannuation funds—funds of the workers of Australia. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott), who is at the table, has just assured us that the government is not going to mandate the use of superannuation funds to bail out the FAC, the government and the ANL. But certainly it is subliminally there. So far in this debate there has been no reference to the resolution of the conference in Hobart. It reads, in part:

       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As with the case of ANL, the government will undertake an open tender process for FAC airports. Recognising the absolute desirability of achieving an outcome that sees airport infrastructure involving the savings of Australian working men and women, the government will take all steps necessary, including an indication of preference in tender documents, to maximise the participation in bidding consortia by the Australian superannuation funds, especially industry funds and Australian institutional investors.

       <para>
        That is not mandating it but it is giving it a hell of a shake. What is it all about? It is all about pandering to the marshmallows in the Australian Labor Party. They had to stitch together a deal so that they could back up the promises made in the budget in May by the right wing of the Labor Party and the government to sell these assets so that they could come in with the budget deficit they did.

         Some real questions are being raised as to whether this is going to be possible. We have seen a compromised deal put together within the Labor Party at the conference in Tasmania to appease members of the Centre and the Left of the party who are absolutely opposed to the selling of the FAC. To do that, they have had to come up with the solution of having some social ownership. They now say, `We are not going to tell the superannuation funds that they have got to invest in this, but we are really going to encourage them to do it.' In the process, members of the Labor Party will detrimentally affect the possible outcome of the sale of those airports. What are private investors going to look at? We are not going to get a fair lick of the lolly here. The superannuation funds will get all the attention of the government when being considered in the tender process.

         A number of questions have to be asked about the process that is taking place right before the eyes of the Australian people—the people who own these airports today. They have a reasonable expectation that we will get the maximum price for these airports when they are sold and that the money will be used for the benefit of the Australian people—not to pay for tomorrow's lunch, as the member for Ryan has said.

         A number of questions need to be asked. Will the selling of the airports, on the basis of a 50-year lease, achieve the best outcome for the taxpayers of Australia? The answer is quite simply no, definitely not. This is another case of pandering to the marshmallows of the Labor Party. What about 50-year leases, with the government maintaining ownership? We get a bit of social investment through the superannuation funds by way of government encouragement in the tendering process. But the answer is no. So all of a sudden the projected income from the sale of FAC is down the drain straight away.

         Is this a Labor tactic to sell public assets to its union mates from the ACTU at a bargain price? Most definitely yes. It is encouraging the unions, as was the case with ANL, to invest their superannuation funds. It is another way of pandering to the marshmallows in the Labor Party—they are getting their mates from that side to invest in the ownership of the airports and the ANL.

         I said at a meeting recently in my electorate that the managers of the superannuation fund for the MUA would not really like that and that they are not going to stand up too well to the regulations that the government has just passed or to the legislation on the SIS as far as prudential management is concerned. The comment was made to me that if that union wants to invest in a company that is not liquid, let it lose its money.

         The government is encouraging the investment. It is all about stitching up compromised deals within the Labor Party. Will it create more competition as far as the airports are concerned? Absolutely not; there is no way that it will. Mr Swingler, the General Manager of the FAC, has said that there is no way that it will generate any more competition. He believes that destinations are what attract people, not airports. He says:

        Finally, from the perspective of competition, I have mentioned Professor Hilmer a few times. Competition is a prime consideration and a motivating force in many of the decisions that are being made at the moment. We are firmly of the view that airports are natural monopolies, and that the opportunity for competition between airports is very small. The closest thing that we have to competition for any of our airports at the moment is in north Queensland, with Townsville and Cairns both purportedly serving the Great Barrier Reef, for example. International airlines are leaving Townsville in their droves to go to Cairns, where the charges are something like three times the charges that we apply in Townsville. What we would argue is that it is destinations that compete and not airports.

        The fourth and probably most important question that has to be addressed in this debate is: does this move by the Labor Party provide prudential management of super savings? The answer is most definitely no.

         Contrary to what the parliamentary secretary who is at the table said, the former Senator Susan Ryan—now the executive officer of the Superannuation Associations of Australia—has reaffirmed that superannuation industries object to governments making these sorts of investment decisions and mandating the industry to invest. I will accept that there is no mandating involved at this stage, but we are up to only the thin end of the wedge as far as the government's plans are concerned. Dr Tony Cole was quoted earlier. After Mr Brereton made his statement, Dr Cole said:

        We know what Mr Brereton's motivation is. It is all about trying to save his own bacon. He is the minister in this government who is in all the strife under the sun with ANL, with the privatisation of FAC, with the CAA, and with his IR policy from last year. He has been belted from pillar to post by all sections of the Labor Party, particularly the union movement. But the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will not ever back away from standing up for Minister Brereton. We know why. He owes Minister Brereton from many, many years ago.

        Governments should stay out of it. The parliamentary secretary is nodding his head. He is saying, `Yes.' That is exactly right. These moneys are there for the long-term financial security of the funds' members. They are not there to serve the ideological interests of members of the ALP, be they from the left, the right or the centre or be they just marshmallows. It is not up to any politician to tell a  superannuation fund where it should invest its money. Instead it is the legal responsibility of the fund's trustees to maximise the use of its resources for the lasting benefit of its members.

         I go back to the statement that came out from the Labor Party conference in Tasmania. I will read it again because we are being told that the Labor government is not pushing superannuation funds one way or the other. With this statement, it is beckoning the superannuation funds to be involved in this because it has got to pander to the different factions within the Labor Party, and certainly to the ACTU.

         Let us just assume for a moment that we did say there was some compulsion and that there should be some superannuation investment in our airports. Assuming that we sold or leased the airports to the tune of $2 billion a year, that would be less than two per cent of the pool of $180 billion accumulated in superannuation savings in this country. How dreadful would that be? It would be terrible for the savings of the workers of this country to be invested in our national infrastructure: roads, bridges and railways. We could not have that because it goes to the heart of your ideology. You want only a few people in this country to control investment. You do not want working men and women in this country to have any say in its future because its future is very much dependent upon investment patterns—investment to ensure that we become more productive and more competitive.

         —In the context of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), I wish to make some comments to put clearly on the record the opposition's position and to scuttle once and for all the argument that in some way the opposition has been hypocritical in our approach to this matter. The approach that we have taken has been consistent and is established by any fair record of the speeches.

         I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) invited me to read them again because I have done so in the intervening period. First and foremost, we are not about there being a windfall in compensation to asylum seekers. Our view was that the damages should be quantified. That is not a new and novel principle unknown to the law; it is one that is regularly availed of by parliaments and approved of by courts where compensation claims are specifically quantified in legislation and payments are made in accordance with their quantification.

         Our considered view was that the $1 per day for people who had unlawfully arrived here and who were fully kept by the government in circumstances which were, while depriving people of their liberty, not essentially of a standard of living less—in fact, in my view it would probably be for many a standard much higher—than that which they would have enjoyed at home was an appropriate figure.

         Secondly, the proposition of limiting payment was advanced by then Minister Hand in Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4), considered by this parliament in December 1992. It is refreshing to read that again because the bill that was considered at that time actually dealt with validation of custody prospectively. The then minister said on page 3949 of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         :
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Specifically, the Bill introduces a provision to put it beyond doubt that custody is to continue between the negative determination of an entry application and the removal of the applicant. While removal must be effected as soon as practicable after the entry application is refused and all appeals against, or reviews of, the refusal have been finalised, there are inevitable lead times in procuring travel documents and making associated arrangements. It is essential that there be legislative authority for continued custody through this period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Bill also introduces a provision to extend the permissible period of custody where an entry application decision is reopened by an unfavourable ruling of the courts.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        So the bill consciously dealt with the issue of custody and the maintenance in custody of people prospectively. If you go through the debate you will see that in the then minister's second reading speech it was made clear that in the context of the High Court decision it was perfectly possible for the parliament to deal with that matter at that time.

         Mr Hand suggested that there may be some doubts—it is quite interesting—about this question, not in terms of the validation process but in terms of whether or not the people had been properly detained before that time because the decision had not been reached.

         I tell the honourable member for Berowra—perhaps he has not had the opportunity to see it—that at 14.57 hours today the Liberal Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Joan Sheldon, demanded retrospective legislation to allow for unsettled claims for compensation in relation to the miners killed in the recent Moura mine underground explosion. And so she should in that case. So she should demand that. I would support her, but what I am really saying is that, again, a curative type of legislation would be required to make those decisions retrospective.

         Retrospectivity is now being debated as some terrible thing that has just come into being and that the government of this country has just plucked out from some unknown quarter. This is a completely irresponsible action by the opposition. The legislation now before the House is to protect the Commonwealth against future claims. The opposition agreed in May 1992 and December 1992 and fully supported the government, as has been quoted by the honourable member for Berowra. When he was the member for Dundas he stated:

He said that the opposition supported the government's actions in this. He said, in part, `if people simply get in a boat and seek to land on our shores and often deprive themselves of their documents of identity,' and stated that the opposition supported the government in what it did.

         I reaffirm what I said before the debate was adjourned at the commencement of question time. I stated that what the opposition was proposing to do in the House with this bill was nothing but hypocrisy. It is hypocrisy. Two years ago it supported the bill before the House, but it does not give support when we want to validate it with curative legislation to make sure that in any High Court challenge at least the Commonwealth has the strength of the original intent of the bill, which was supported by the opposition, against any future handling or mishandling. This is where I believe the opposition needs to be reported very clearly.

         Nobody complains about retrospective legislation that confers a benefit. That is done all the time in this parliament with our support. That is what Mrs Sheldon has called for in Queensland. It is not a different principle. Mrs Sheldon has called for retrospective legislation to confer a benefit on people who might otherwise not be able to make a claim. But that is not the same thing as retrospectively validating the detention of somebody who was held in custody illegally. That is no more appropriate than legislating to retrospectively invoke charges on people—in the form of a tax, in criminal jurisdiction or the like.

         —I do understand, and I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe this point has to be made: it cannot be seriously argued by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) in this House today that the dollar a day provision was not retrospective. Section 54RA denies any claim for compensation for past wrongful detention and substitutes the statutory screen limiting any compensation to $1 per day. That section operates to retrospectively alter the amount of damages that may be payable for the past detention which was found by the High Court to be unlawful because of the technical reliance on the wrong section of the act in those circumstances.

         Now that section 54RA has been placed in doubt by further decisions of the High Court in respect of the acquisitions power, what the government is proposing in this bill is to ensure that the Commonwealth's position is protected to the greatest extent possible. In the same set of acquisition cases, the High Court gave indications of support for the curative approach which this bill adopts. The government is not asking the opposition to embrace retrospectivity on this problem for the first time. I repeat, for the benefit of the honourable member for Berowra: it is not the first time that we have requested retrospectivity. It was granted in May 1992 and in December 1992.

         What the government is asking with this bill before the House is that the opposition maintain its support for the proposition that, while those unauthorised arrivals are detained—albeit unlawfully because of the mistaken interpretation of section 88—and their claims for refugee status are assessed, they should not be able to claim from the Commonwealth a windfall of damages, which on one refugee advocate's estimate could be as much as $90 million. In doing so, the opposition does not now need to depart from the principled policy that it embraced in December 1992. Section 54RA was retrospective. We cannot deny that. The opposition supported it. The curative measures proposed by this bill will place the Commonwealth in the strongest possible position to defend claims for compensation which, if paid, would amount to that windfall. We cannot have it both ways. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you and the parliament for the right of reply.

        This bill provides for immediate financial assistance to farmers experiencing exceptional circumstances due to drought. It is part of a comprehensive package of drought assistance announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 21 September 1994.

         I need hardly remind honourable members of the crippling effect which the current drought is having on significant parts of the rural community. In many areas, the drought is the worst on record and, unfortunately, the Bureau of Meteorology does not expect a break before autumn 1995. Many farmers, their families and the rural communities in which they live are suffering extreme hardship. Indeed, the situation is critical in the worst affected parts of Queensland and New South Wales. Without immediate assistance, the hard work and personal investment of thousands of Australians might well be wasted.

         The package of measures announced by the government is designed to assist farm businesses which could not have anticipated the severity of this drought and to ensure basic requirements of farm families are met. In the Prime Minister's words, the package will ensure that we do not leave these people behind. It creates a safety net to provide for the immediate cash flow needs of the worst affected farm families during and after this exceptional drought.

         The main elements of the package are: a drought relief payment for those experiencing exceptional circumstances due to drought—the subject of this bill; further measures under the rural adjustment scheme to assist farm businesses; and further resources for financial and social counselling. The package provides for a systematic approach to drought relief based on the principles of the national drought policy. This policy, agreed on by all governments in 1992, recognises that drought is a recurring feature of rural Australia which needs to be factored into normal farm management but acknowledges that government assistance may be required in exceptional circumstances.

         In total, the package is estimated to cost approximately $164 million over two years. This includes the commitment to match donations to the farmhand appeal. This appeal has already raised over $5 million from private contributions. This means that, when combined with the government's matching contribution, more than $10 million in additional emergency relief is being provided to the farming community in drought affected areas. The government's response is substantial by any measure and has been applauded by the farm sector and wider community.

         The government has also indicated that additional measures will be considered to ameliorate the effects of the current drought and to help our farming community to better prepare for future droughts. These may include further initiatives in the areas of taxation, income equalisation deposits, land care and climate research.

         The government has been providing substantial assistance for drought since 1992 through the rural adjustment scheme, rural counselling and landcare. However, further measures have become necessary as the human and social consequences of the drought continue to escalate. In particular, it has become apparent that farm welfare needs are not being adequately addressed by existing government programs.

         The drought relief payment provided for in this bill is designed to meet this need. It will provide eligible farm families in drought exceptional circumstances areas with cash for basic necessities and services. Payment will be at the level of jobsearch allowance, JSA, including partner allowance and family payments where applicable. Farmers in receipt of a drought relief payment will also receive a health care card.

         The drought relief payment will be subject to both income and off-farm assets tests. Importantly, farm assets will not be included in the assets test, and no work activity test will apply in recognition of the special circumstances applying to farmers during exceptional drought. Students from farm families eligible for drought relief payment will also qualify for Austudy assistance. For farm families in exceptional drought circumstances who do not wish to apply for the drought relief payment but who wish to access Austudy, provision has been made to waive the Austudy farm assets test.

         Drought relief payments respond to the needs of those farmers most affected by drought exceptional circumstances. It complements the well targeted social security system. Drought relief payments will be administered by the Department of Social Security on behalf of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Under the scheme, farmers will first need to obtain a certificate from a state rural adjustment scheme authority confirming that they are experiencing exceptional circumstances due to drought. They will then make application for assistance through one of the regional offices of the Department of Social Security. The quickest way for farmers to have claims assessed will be to ring the drought contact officer at the nearest Social Security regional office and make an appointment. Where it is difficult for farmers to get to these offices, they should ring their nearest drought contact officer for advice.

         Arrangements have already been made for payments to begin this week, backdated to 1 October. Payments will continue for a period of up to six months after the drought has broken, in recognition that the productivity of farms and farm incomes will not recover as soon as it rains. This bill provides for the introduction of the drought relief payment through amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992. It includes minor amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to benefits associated with the drought relief payment and to make necessary consequential changes. This bill also establishes a standing appropriation for drought relief payments to ensure that funds are available to fully meet the claims of all eligible applicants. Interim payments are being made from the Advance to the Minister for Finance.

         —In response to the point made by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) at the end of his speech about our being keen to expedite the passage of the Drought Relief Payment Bill, I clearly indicate that we are. We have welcomed the provisions of what might be called the welfare aspects of the government's approach to drought. Therefore, we will do everything in our power to facilitate the passage of the bill, although I forewarn that we will be moving an amendment calling on the government to recognise the impact of the severe drought in so much of eastern Australia—and it is spreading to other parts of the nation—on the small business sector. I would have thought it was incumbent upon this government to recognise the importance of undertaking that recognition, in view of the fact that the Queensland government, which is of its own colour, has done so. It deserves some commendation for that, and I foreshadow that we will therefore be moving an amendment to that effect.

         As I said, we welcome this package because it matches existing longstanding policy of our own; that is, in times of very real welfare need, those inhibitions, those obstacles, to farmers receiving the sort of assistance that other members of the community expect and take as their right in times of downturn ought to be available and ought not to be blocked by the assets test. We have a policy whereby, during times of severe economic hardship, the assets test ought to be lifted in the case of a range of welfare benefits and in the case of Austudy. Regardless of what you say about mechanisms and regardless of the silly political cheap shots that have flowed around this place and other places in recent times, the net effect of our policy would have delivered to hard-hit farmers almost exactly the same outcomes as those in this package.

It is now pretty much a matter of record that the government was forced into this, shamed into this, by a number of events. One was the highlighting by those on our side of politics, who are constantly moving around in rural areas, of the plight out there. Another was the publicity via the television sets.

         —Ray Martin and so forth. Individual Australians received publicity in their living rooms which clearly indicated that there was a crisis out there. It was not a new crisis. It was a crisis of some standing; it was a crisis which went back a long way. Another aspect is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his often repeated style, in Townsville rather arrogantly dismissed drought as something that farmers had to live with. He said, `Look, it's always out there; farmers have just got to learn to manage it.' It bears repeating that farmers have little capacity to cope with the sort of drought that we have seen in recent years, particularly when they have been operating in the economic environment that this government has imposed on them in recent times. I will come to that later.

         I want to place clearly on the record—and I will be moving an amendment on this further down the track—that small businesses are bleeding very badly in many of the drought affected areas. They have been, to some extent, rather forgotten in this debate. That is why I want to put it clearly on the record now. I refer particularly to those small businesses which are most dependent upon the rural sector. Machinery agents probably start to hurt before most farmers do. In anticipation of tough times, farmers close the cheque books early. Many of the machinery agents out there, who are an absolutely vital part of the farm infrastructure of this nation, have long since folded. I do not know how some of them keep going under the current circumstances. Fuel agents, contractors, particularly in the harvesting and the spraying areas, right down to the corner store operator all are feeling immense pain out there. It is incumbent upon us, since we are now in general agreement that we are willing to approach this with a `we have Australians bleeding out there approach', to acknowledge that it is not just farmers feeling this pain.

         I come back to our essential approach, which has long been one of a three-tiered foundational attitude towards severe drought. The first tier is that, when severe drought of the sort that we are now seeing hits, there must be adequate delivery of welfare provisions. That is what this parcel is about. The second tier is that there must be a willingness to address what might be called retention of farms and farm assets. There is no point in simply seeing this as a welfare issue. It has to be seen as an economic issue.

         Our farm sector is still extraordinarily important, providing about a quarter of our export dollars. In truth, I suspect it is capable of once again providing a great deal more when the drought breaks because commodity prices are improving; export opportunities in Asia are expanding. It is a sector which still provides an enormous amount of employment in this country not only at the base farm production level but also in Australia's largest manufacturing sector, the food processing sector, which employs some 200,000-odd people.

       <para first-indent="16">

         That food processing sector in many ways is at great risk at the moment. It is at risk, for example, because of the way in which our abattoirs, which are currently running overtime as people put stock through them, will be put in a very perilous position indeed when good rains come as there simply will not be the throughput. Our vegetable and fruit processors, and even the dairy industry, are very much dependent in the end upon farm production—and so too are the people who are employed in those sectors.

         The third aspect to our policy is, of course, recovery. I note again that the government has acknowledged that mechanisms will have to be put in place—and the Minister for Resources, who was here a moment ago, made reference to that—to ensure that the farm sector, when good rains do come, is not only able to recover but also able to adequately do that which it is apparently now being told it should have done before this drought, and that is to say: prepare for the next downturn. That centres on a range of things. It means that, hopefully, we will see a proper commitment to IEDs and to farm management bonds in that they will be made attractive and effective enough to help farmers prepare for regular downturns. That has long been our policy.

         What also has to be said, of course, is that it must never be forgotten that the farm sector is bleeding so badly in this country primarily because of the sort of economic policy parameters that farmers have had to operate under in recent years. The simple fact of the matter is that Australia's farmers have had years of farm inflation two and three times that of their competitors abroad. Seventy or 80 per cent of our agricultural product goes abroad. On international markets we are price takers; so, when our competitiveness is gutted on international markets by high domestic prices and continually rising costs on farm, there is no ability to recover them. Farmers simply have to cop the squeeze—and we have been copping the squeeze for years.

         The high inflation rates have been accompanied, of course, by massively high levels of interest rates—at one stage, interest rates in excess of 20 per cent for a period of some 18 months. The damage that did to the farm sector at a time of historically very low commodity prices was absolutely enormous, incalculable. It has left farmers in net terms with a debt problem, a debt load, of some $17.3 billion. One of the things we are now seeing—I will talk about this in a moment; and, frankly, I am going to be honest and say I think this has taken all of us by surprise—is the extraordinarily vulnerable condition of the farm sector. I do not think any of us realised just how many farmers were so severely weakened in terms of their financial position by what they have been through over the last 10 or 15 years. I am amazed at how enfeebled they have become in terms of their capacity to cope with drought even in the early stages, let alone what we have seen in so much of Queensland and northern New South Wales.

         What I am essentially saying is that even regular drought is proving far too much for a lot of primary producers, let alone severe drought. We do draw that distinction. It has always been the coalition's position that farmers ought to be both encouraged and facilitated to prepare for regular downturn. There is nothing new in our policy position on that at all. That has been our position for a long time. Plainly, it has not been possible for farmers to do so. When it comes to severe drought, we have to draw a distinction. We have seen severe drought on a number of occasions. It occurs every 10 to 15 years somewhere on the continent, often on an extensive basis in extensive areas across the continent. We are in one of those periods now. The last one was in the early 1980s. We find that farmers, because of the sort of cost parameters that they faced during the 1980s, have been unable to prepare themselves for even a modest downturn, let alone a severe one. As a result the devastation is absolutely enormous.

         We have had years too of refusal on the part of the government to grapple with the frequently highlighted problem of high cost imposts post farm gate. The relevance of this to the current drought situation is extraordinarily important. Report after report has made it very plain that the Australian beef industry is hugely disadvantaged by the costs involved in processing beef in this country compared with those in competitor nations, whether New Zealand, Argentina, the USA or wherever.

         We have had one of those reports again as recently as six weeks or so ago, just confirming what the previous eight or nine reports said: that the reason we are competitive is that our producers take a lower return at farm gate level than they should have to, because that is the only way we can be internationally competitive. Those sorts of things are critically important. In that sense, it has to be said that the insistence that the farm sector face a so-called level playing field far ahead of anybody else in the community means that the rest of the community has to face the fact that the farm sector has been extraordinarily weakened as a result and is therefore entitled, in my view, to very generous consideration in the current circumstances.

         There is a range of issues that will have to be carefully considered in the government's coming two tranches in relation to its drought policy. We have covered some of them. But one of them will remain the incredible level of indebtedness in the farm sector. I do not know what we say as a country to the Darling Downs farmer who has lost eight crops in a row over four years of drought and has seen his equity slip from 100 per cent to 40 per cent. That is an extraordinarily severe situation. We have a couple of choices. One of them is to say, `It's a level playing field, fellows; you haven't made it, you weren't able to prepare, therefore it's best if you just sort of fall off the edge.' But I would not have thought that that was in the nation's interests. I have made that comment by way of illustrating that, as a nation, we are going to be faced with the real problem of post-drought reconstruction and the need not to simply allow a lot of our best farmers to fall off the edge.

         In that sense, I particularly note one aspect of our rural assistance policy that the government picked up: that the maximum allowable assistance with interest rates will be significantly upgraded from $50,000 a year to $100,000 or $300,000 over five years. We welcome that. I welcome too the picking up of our commitment to extend that relief for a period beyond the end of the drought. In my view, that opens the way for effective negotiation with the various players in the field—farmers themselves, farm leaders, lenders, governments—to look at what can be done to reconstruct people's horrendous debt loads.

         On 11 May last year in this place, I clearly warned that a very severe drought was emerging in parts of Queensland. I talked of and listed areas that had been in drought for two and three years at that time. I talked about the fact that, in places like Toowoomba, I had been shown the need for food parcels from charitable organisations, I had been shown the need for things like boots for farmers who were not able to access welfare. I was told then of the strain that farm children were being put under as they watched what their parents were going through. I was told of the impact that that was having, even the point of suicide in some families because children blamed themselves for what their parents were going through. They were adopting the attitude that `Mum and Dad are going through this because they are determined to try to hang on to the farm for my sake.' It was a human tragedy of enormous proportions even then.

In fairness, we have all been astonished by the rapidity with which this thing has extended and is extending. This is reflected by some material I have received in my office to date.

         As the drought is biting hard in the Parkes district with no relief in sight and no grain available locally, many sheep producers are now faced with having to shoot low conditioned aged sheep with negative commercial value, in order that core breeding stock might be retained.

We are approaching the shire to dig pits, as larger combined pits should be cheaper to dig and easier to manage.

        That letter comes from someone in an area that has not experienced the severity of drought that we have seen in Queensland. Yet here we are, this thing is sweeping south at an alarming rate. It is overtaking communities at a frightening pace. We now have the RSPCA calling for taxpayer assistance for the cost of bullets so that stock can be humanely put down. I will say again that I think it is absolutely amazing that there has been no significant emphasis on the need to preserve as much as possible our breeding flocks and herds. This is a very important issue. A major drought meeting was held in Sydney today by the New South Wales Farmers Association. The president of that organisation, Mr John Crawford, makes the observation that New South Wales is facing the worst drought it has had in 50 years. He said that the 1940s situation was worse only due to rabbits and wartime labour shortages. He warned that farmers are now killing their breeding stock. A news release quotes him as saying:

        The tragedy is that New South Wales is running out of grain. We may be out in two weeks time, but there is a three to four week lag time in shipping grain from Western Australia. Last week we asked Senator Collins to conduct an audit of grain supply and demand.

        Members might recall that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) asked the Prime Minister almost three weeks ago in this place whether the government had any idea of what grain inventories out there looked like and what the needs were likely to be. The Prime Minister replied, `Oh, no, that is up to the farm organisations to do.' Then we had Senator Collins saying `No, we will conduct one' a few days ago, because the Wheat Board put out a press release saying that there was only three weeks supply left. It has put the price up to $230 a tonne—way over world parity. All this stuff about what had happened to grain prices—look where they have gone. I do not know who on earth can afford to feed stock at $230 a tonne for feed wheat. It is absolutely beyond me.

Let me tell honourable members something interesting: I am told that internationally our wool buyers know full well how serious the situation is. They are very worried about this drought. Whilst from their perspective there is plenty of wool in the stockpile for now, they do not believe that Australian wool growers will be in a position to get back into production post-drought if they lose their essential flocks, their breeding flocks, because they recognise that many wool growers are simply too financially weakened to take that on.

It has analysed quite clearly that there are enormous needs in the Scone, Maryvale and Mudgee areas, which have been excluded from the list of exceptional drought areas, and those needs will now go unmet. It seems quite apparent that there are farmers in those areas who face extraordinarily difficult circumstances but who will have to wait for many months, if the current guidelines are rigidly adhered to, before they will be able to get assistance. We need to confront this problem on a fair basis.

         The other area that I touched on earlier and which I come back to is the effect on small businesses. It is assumed that if the farm sector is helped in rural areas there will be a trickle down effect. To a large extent, that is true. But in some areas of Queensland the trickle down effect has not happened because relief has been so unbelievably late in coming. The Queensland government, a Labor government, has acknowledged that need and has put in place a package for $5 million. I understand that the scheme will essentially run along the lines that modest interest rate assistance will be provided to small businesses affected by the drought and in a situation where they have to increase their debt.

But the essential point remains that no effective mechanism has been put in their place and that we have been hit by a severe drought before alternative mechanisms were developed.

They rightly point out, and I think they deserve great credit for this, that many of those small businesses in some of these worst hit areas were helping farmers before anybody else was. But now, because the drought has lasted longer than anybody anticipated, many of those small businesses are in danger of total collapse themselves. Six small businesses have closed in the last couple of weeks in small towns a short distance away from Toowoomba, for example.

         —The government does recognise the disastrous effects that the current drought is having on farmers and on Australia. Over recent years, the rural sector has experienced a great deal of hardship—successive years of weak commodity prices, world recession and declining farmers terms of trade—which has resulted in low incomes for many. Farmers have responded to these financial pressures by increasing on-farm productivity and/or reducing expenditure. However, the capacity of many farmers to adjust and produce is stretched. This has been exacerbated in those areas experiencing protracted and widespread drought now.

         The member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) made quite an opening when he said how like the coalition's policy the Drought Relief Payment Bill is. However, when we look at what he said on 31 August, we realise how far apart the two policies are and how little the farming community would have got from the coalition had it been in power. On 31 August the spokesman for the coalition on primary industry proposed two ways of assessing extreme conditions. He said that either two consecutive years in drought or three years in five years should qualify for extreme conditions under the coalition's drought policy.

         However, I do agree with some of the comments the member for Gwydir made about the definition of drought. There are enormous difficulties in having an assessment that is fair across all areas. You only have to look especially at the methodology in assessing drought in New South Wales to see that that is so. In fact, there is no legislation relating to drought relief in New South Wales and the government can change its relief schemes as it wishes.

In the larger western division rural lands protection area, the minimum area that can be drought declared is around 20 per cent. At least half of the proposed area must be unable to sustain sheep or cattle. Clearly definable areas of any size that adjoin a qualifying district can be added initially or later.

It is expected that will be in place at the end of the year. Further to those comments on the difficulty of assessing drought, I have a letter from the Casino Rural Lands Protection Board.

That is true, but in their original form as they came from the government they were clearly marked `draft'. The member for Gwydir omitted to tell us that the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, through his office, distributed far and wide throughout New South Wales those lists containing errors of places that should not have been on them, knowing that they were incorrect.

To say that the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the member for Grafton, acted irresponsibly is to understate the case dramatically. He did it purely for political advantage. Whilst those opposite claim that the DSS had those lists at those meetings, it was not the intention of the DSS to mislead the public.

         The target group for the drought relief payment is those farmers in extreme drought. That is consistent with the national drought policy which was agreed between Commonwealth and state ministers in 1992. This measure supports a raft of policies and adds to the government's response. This package is a quick and effective response aimed at those farmers in exceptional circumstances who have been in drought for 24 of the last 36 months. Areas in which support is available will be subject to an ongoing review as they meet the 24 in 36 test. I hope members on the other side of the chamber do not get up and say the 24 in 36 test is the wrong criteria. The difficulty we have with the criteria is in determining where to declare drought. The integrity of this package is maintained because we have a criteria to target drought. If we let it go, then the scheme will be rorted and untargeted.

It should be made quite clear that it is the non-farm assets that will be tested.

         This situation did not happen overnight. I think everybody in this chamber this evening would understand that. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party indicated, there was a very large measure of general commodity price downturn right across the country and that was coupled with a high interest rate regime implemented by the government over a number of years. All of that has been exacerbated by drought.

         As the Deputy Leader of the National Party said, the farmers have not been able to access the exceptional circumstances provisions of RAS without first selling off-farm assets. This has created difficulties where farmers have taken steps to provide for their retirement. In recognition of this, investment in bona fide insurance and superannuation funds has been excluded from the assets test for the exceptional circumstances support while an assets test of $163,500 will apply for other off-farm assets.

All of those measures have been agreed to in conjunction with the state governments. Again, I would like to commend, to a certain degree, the present Labor government in Queensland for the initiatives that it has taken in some of these areas.

In the area of drought preparedness, the government will provide incentives for farms and rural communities to better protect the agricultural resource base during drought and encourage improved land management. It will consider providing a generous investment allowance for farm storage and water facilities and faster depreciation on storage facilities.

The government will also examine the possibility of providing further funding through its labour market programs to address land degradation and environmental protection in drought prone areas. All of that is now on the record. It is now up to the government to honour its commitments in that package. The Prime Minister, in a media release dated 21 September, stated:

To a certain extent it seems that the government had to be taken kicking and screaming to the point that we have now achieved. We on this side of the House emphasise that we still see the three Rs—relief, retention and recovery—as being important; in particular, the area of retention of fodder for breeding stocks, which has not been addressed in the government's package but which has been addressed in our package and in the coalition's package announced last week in Queensland.

         It is becoming increasingly apparent that the drought which has devastated large areas of Queensland is a significant wildcard in the national economic equation. Already there is the prospect of higher prices for staples such as bread, eggs and, in the long-term, beef. The Queensland Graingrowers Association state council meeting yesterday was told wheat harvests had fallen below 10 million tonnes, wiping $1 billion from Australia's economic returns. Although the drought has been a reality for a number of years now, the extent of the tragedy seems to have only recently struck home to decision-makers in Canberra. Clearly the loss of production and need for special assistance will be a drain on the economy for some time to come. The Federal Government needs to be mindful of this in setting its economic parameters for the foreseeable future.

         The importance of the rural community to Australia's economic fortunes justifies a continuing investment in keeping people on the land. The only saving grace from the current situation is that the drought will eventually break. It will be far easier to rebuild markets once this happens if those who have the knowledge and skills have been able to persevere on their properties. We cannot assume the drought will be over quickly and planning must proceed accordingly.

        I would like to add my support to what the Deputy Leader of the National Party said about small business. I speak from first-hand experience in the rural centre of Toowoomba where the effects of the drought are exacerbated by the flow-on effects, whether it be to the seed merchants, the agricultural machinery agents or in social areas such as the schools. In my area we have arguably the highest per capita rate of private schooling in the country and that is being adversely affected by the drought in a number of ways with downturns in enrolments. Hopefully, as a result of this legislation and other elements of the package, that situation will be redressed.

         I also want to refer very briefly to an anomaly and I ask the minister—through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is at the table—and some of the officials in the chamber to take this on board in Queensland. It came to my notice last week that there is seemingly an anomaly between the Department of Social Security and Senator Collins's office or his department in terms of who should receive the payments. It is a very basic misunderstanding in that I was informed that only those who were south of the Atherton Tableland and west of the Great Dividing Range in the state of Queensland would qualify. I knew that was wrong but that was the message given by the Department of Social Security. I could not get Senator Collins's office to respond over a couple of days. I mentioned it to the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Ed Casey, whom, thankfully, I saw at a function in Oakey a day or so later. He was able, I think through the government network, to tell me that that was wrong and that the Lockyer Valley to the east of Toowoomba, where there are a lot of hard-hit vegetable growers, will be included. I welcome that. But it took a long time to get to that point. I just ask the officials to make sure that there is no misunderstanding between the responsible departments when imparting information on some of the benefits under this legislation and other elements of the package.

         I would like to mention one other aspect. It is a very sensitive issue but one which I nevertheless want to raise. I refer to the rate of rural suicide. I am sure one or two of the members on the government side who are in the chamber will understand what I am saying here in that there is evidence that the suicide rate amongst male rural youth is the highest in the country. Without naming the small town concerned, there is anecdotal evidence that in the last year in a small country town in south Queensland five people have committed suicide as a direct or indirect result of some of the difficulties that this package and this legislation are setting out to address.

What a far cry it is from the previous speaker from the other side, the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). After 25 minutes of cheap political point taking he had the gall to say, `Let's put cheap politics aside.' There is no doubt that the drought most of Australia is experiencing at this time is the source of a great deal of frustration, anger and hurt. Cheap political point taking is going to do nothing at all to resolve that. That is why we on this side of the House are so proud that this is a far-reaching program.

        I think that letter also symbolises the rapport that this side of the parliament has with rural Australia. When we come to debate this historic and compassionate bill, let us do as the honourable member for Groom suggested—let us strip away politics and identify the Drought Relief Payment Bill for what it is. It is a bill to give relief to those thousands of families who are experiencing the most exceptional drought circumstances ever.

         I have been a primary producer for the past 22 years and I support what the Deputy Leader of the National Party said on 31 August. He said, `We acknowledge that ordinary drought is a recurring feature of the Australian farm environment.' He then went on to say that he believed in the three Rs approach to drought support—relief, retention and recovery. Undoubtedly, the deputy leader will have noticed the support by the NFF and various other observers—including ACOSS—who have welcomed this package because it certainly does address the three Rs.

         Obviously, the whole package is aimed at the retention of families in rural Australia. Families who have shown their resourcefulness and ability to survive need to be acclaimed by the government and by everyone concerned. This bill goes straight to that objective. Funding is available through various initiatives in this package and will enable families to survive and hold their farm. It is significant that families will continue to receive benefits for up to six months after the drought conditions cease. Let us pray that that moment comes sooner than we all expect.

         Whenever criteria are drawn up to select some members of our community into a group and exclude others, there is dissent. In the case of exceptional drought circumstances, we have seen some objection to areas being excluded. That argument will be ongoing. I notice that the Deputy Leader of the National Party indicated, even with his liberal criteria of three years drought out of five, that `a lot of New South Wales is excluded although a significant area in the western division on the far north west would be included'. Using the selected criteria of 24 months out of the last 36 months, these areas have all been included and so have additional areas.

         I conclude on a note of dissension in relation to an issue that was raised by the member for Page. Some statements have been raging in a war between the New South Wales state minister and the federal minister over areas that have been excluded. I point out that at all times the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in New South Wales, Mr Ian Causley, was aware of the criteria, yet advice went from his office to all parts of New South Wales that a number of incorrectly named regions would be included in this package. How unfortunate it is for those people now to find out that they will not be included.

         Let us go to the New South Wales record on drought. I have here a copy of the New South Wales budget papers for 1994-95. It shows that in 1993-94 the New South Wales government estimated that $75 million would be available for expenses of the Rural Assistance Authority. In fact, it spent only $62 million—a shortfall of $13 million. This year, because it did not spend all of its money last year, the government has reduced its budget by another $9 million to $53 million. Is this a measure of the compassion of the New South Wales government, whose agriculture minister is taking this federal government to task, claiming that we lack compassion?

If this minister from New South Wales is so compassionate towards people affected by drought, then I suggest he make sure his actions support his words because the record of his treatment of drought and drought affected families certainly comes nowhere near the record that we on this side of the federal parliament have put together.

         —The Drought Relief Payment Bill amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Health Insurance Act, 1973 and the Social Security Act 1991 to allow for a new payment called the drought relief payment. We on this side of the House welcome this piece of legislation as far as it goes, though I do have a number of serious reservations about it, which I will come to later.

         For farmers to qualify for assistance under this package they must be in an exceptional circumstance drought declared area and, additional to that, they must also meet certain other financial hardship guidelines. If they do qualify, they are then entitled to receive the drought relief payment which is equivalent to the jobsearch allowance, more familiarly known as the dole. The advantage over the dole is that, even though it is the same amount of money, no activity test applies. Of course, there are one or two other side issues. I particularly welcome the measure in relation to children. Their children will be eligible for Austudy without the assets test being applied, which is something that this government has brought in.

         I hope that this drought relief payment does not end up like various schemes that have been put in place in the past by this government. I was in Dubbo at the beginning of last year when the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), announced the farm household support scheme. This was going to be one of the saviours of the farming community, which was already experiencing hardship from drought and for other reasons. Today in the Dubbo social security area, which is a vast area of north-west New South Wales, there are only eight farmers receiving farm household support. I am told that there are only 80 in the drought declared areas of Australia. That scheme, which was much trumpeted at the time, has certainly been a fizzer.

No doubt these will switch across to the drought relief payment and I hope the government will not then claim credit for their coming into this payment. The same amount of money is to be paid, so I hope that will be taken into account.

         This bill, contrary to popular belief, does not apply throughout all the drought areas of Australia. It does not even apply to all farmers in the exceptional circumstance areas. Indeed, only a small part of New South Wales and Queensland will benefit. Drought affected areas, for example, in South Australia will receive zilch from this bill. To use the minister's own figures, a total of 5,000 farmers—3,500 in Queensland and 1,500 in New South Wales—will receive anything at all. There are something like 40,000 farmers in New South Wales, but only 3.75 per cent of them will receive some assistance. Looking at it the other way around, in excess of 96 per cent of New South Wales farmers will not receive one cent of assistance from this bill.

         —None on the north coast, as the honourable member for Cowper says. The drought in many areas has been around for four years or so. I believe that, even if it rained tomorrow, next year could well be the worst year of all financially for many people. If we look at the history of this drought, at first the government would not act at all. Then the present minister would not visit any of the drought areas. But to his credit he did later on, and we appreciate that. I cannot remember him visiting drought declared areas in New South Wales, though he has been to Queensland on more than one occasion.

         The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) refused to visit a drought property. When he was in Queensland a month or so ago, he was asked whether he would visit a drought stricken property. He said words to the effect, `You've seen one, you've seen them all. Drought is a natural part of life. Go and suck eggs.'

         —No, because all hell broke loose after that statement. There was uproar in Queensland and, to a lesser  extent, in New South Wales. A lot of disdain was poured on the Prime Minister. I think he realised what a mistake he had made at the time. He then had to prepare the ground to get out there and see the devastation that the drought was causing. But it was not until the Smith Family and the Salvation Army handed out assistance to farmers who were in desperate plight, and until TV celebrities such as Ray Martin put on charity concerts to raise money to help farmers, something that this government itself was not doing, that the Prime Minister was finally told it could be electorally damaging if he did not do something, and he was finally stung into action.

         The total package amounts to $164 million over two years. An amount of $52.99 million will be spent in the first year and $24.22 million in the second year, a total of $77.21 million. How they get these exact figures is totally beyond me because we do not know the number of farmers that will apply or how long the drought is going to continue. I think the figures should be rounded out somewhat. That, of course, leaves $87 million to be added to the RAS funding, which is something we all welcome.

         As generous as that $164 million is—and we acknowledge that—we should compare it with the $620 million, in 1994  dollars, that the coalition spent in the 1982-83 drought. We should compare it with the fact that, if interest rates rise one per cent, $170 million will be ripped off farmers in extra interest payments. We have already had a 0.75 per cent rise. Probably another three-quarters of one per cent rise is due before Christmas at least.

I dare say just the increase in fuel tax that this government has imposed on the farming community since the drought started would well exceed what it is offering now in the drought package. In the 10 years the government has been in office, fuel tax has gone from 6c a litre to something of the order of 35c a litre.

         The one element in this drought relief package that the government has not picked up from the coalition's package—I noticed that it lifted about 30 per cent of the package—was the fodder subsidy scheme. About 80 per cent of calls coming into my office are calling for this sort of scheme. I realise that both the National Farmers Federation and the Grains Council of Australia are against a fodder subsidy scheme, for reasons that neither I nor my constituents have not been able to comprehend. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that fact, and the government has latched onto that knowledge and belted us around the head with it. There is very little hay around, but wheat, which farmers were delivering at about $100 a tonne at the end of harvest, is now being bought back at $235 a tonne, if the farmers can afford that. That is ASW 10 per cent wheat.

         A couple in their mid-60s rang me from Coolabah, which is a little town halfway between Nyngan and Bourke. They are not in an exceptional circumstance area and are purchasing about 10 tonnes of wheat a week. They have a 500 kilometre round trip to haul it from the Narromine silos. They have 13 fuel drop-off points in their paddocks to get that wheat out to their sheep. They can afford to feed about 6,000 of 8,000 sheep—the other 2,000 will have to take their chances—hoping that they will get their sheep through to shearing in January so that they can take advantage of the higher price. You do not have to be a mathematician to work out that that is an unsustainable position. Any assistance that could be given with fodder subsidy would be very welcome.

         I want to talk about the rural lands protection boards that are included in New South Wales and those that have been excluded. Initially, when the minister announced the scheme, a map went out which included 11 boards. In northern New South Wales, it included the boards of Wanaaring, Bourke and Brewarrina in my electorate. Soon after that, another list went out, with the approval of the minister, despite what has been said on the other side of the House today—I will come back to that a minute—listing 10 more boards. The initial criteria was that you had to be drought declared for 24 months out of 36 months to qualify. The first 11 boards met that criterion, but the next 10 did not.

I asked why those areas had been included and why the criteria had been expanded.

Marie Russell rang me the other day—she will not mind me using her name; she gave me permission—and told me that in 1990 her family were in a desperate position and had to send their stock off to Nyngan. Most of the stock were wiped out with the flood that went through then. They put some money together which they had on hand—the family has been there since 1885 I think—and they repurchased stock in 1991. But they went into a raging drought again and spent $55,000 of their savings, every penny they had, in keeping that flock alive.

         In 1992, when the drought continued, they lost 7,000 of their 9,000 sheep. They then had to turn round and restock again. In 1993 they went through drought yet again, and now in the middle of October 1994 these people are not in an exceptional circumstance area. They cannot afford to send their sheep away and they cannot afford to buy fodder. They are in a desperate situation. If they are not assisted in some way, these people will go—a family that has been there for over a 100 years. An absolute tragedy. I hope the government in cooperation with the state government will somehow see fit to help people like this.

         I was talking only last night to Wayne Altman from Gilgandra, which is in the electorate of the shadow minister who is sitting beside me. He rang me because he is distributing food parcels just north of Dubbo. The Dubbo board has been in exceptional circumstances for drought for only 16 months out of the last 36, so it is favourably off, according to the government. They are putting together $100 food parcels which will feed a family of four for a week. The sorts of things that go into the parcels are basic things—flour, sugar, Weetbix, canned fruit, toothpaste, toilet paper and that sort of thing. Rotary, St Vincents and various food stores such as Franklins are helping in this.

         Coordinators are identifying these people and, in providing free labour, going out to them. It is done as discreetly as possible. They are approaching these people and saying, `We hope you are not offended'—to use the words of Wayne Altman—`but please accept it as our gift to you.' I asked what the reaction of the people was when given the parcel and he said, `It is heartbreaking because many of these people break down and weep in front of us.' They do not want to make the family feel bad in any way. It is at times like this that the best in people come out by providing this sort of assistance. I think that is wonderful indeed.

         I just mention that example of an area because it is not within cooee of going into a drought declared exceptional circumstance area. Dubbo, which is on 16 months, will have to wait for another 16 months before it qualifies for the 24 months. New South Wales is 93 per cent drought declared today. I have many boards in my electorate, such as the Wilcannia board, the Cobar board, the Broken Hill board, et cetera—boards virtually the size of Tasmania. To say that these areas cannot be included, when there are divisions within those pasture protection boards or rural lands protection boards which should be included, is sad indeed.

         The Mayor of Nyngan, Elaine McLaughlin, wrote to me only today saying how desperate she is to get Nyngan included in the areas for assistance. There are other areas to the south like Condobolin, Forbes, Hillston, et cetera that should be included too. I would like the minister, if the drought continues for another two or three months or so and it becomes more desperate, to look at somehow enlarging the criteria when he has to revisit this legislation so that these people can be assisted.

         —I really was not going to speak on the Drought Relief Payment Bill because I thought it would be well catered for. I am bitterly disappointed to hear the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), a man for whom I have a high regard and a man who I think was the first in this House to call attention to the crimes of the Australian Wool Corporation—something which nearly caused him to lose his preselection for the National Party. In the years I have been in this House I have become increasingly intolerant of cant and humbug. There is no doubt it occurs a great deal on both sides of this House.

         This bill we are debating today is very good legislation. I have no hesitation at all in congratulating both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Senator Bob Collins, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It is well known that I am not a fan of the Prime Minister, but in this area I think he has done extremely well indeed. Some of the things that the member for Parkes raised I am very well aware of, but I suggest the reason for the hardship that exists in rural Australia has been commodity prices, particularly in the wool area, and not directly the drought. I am not a stranger to drought either. When I took up pastoral property with my brother in 1964 we went for six continuous years into declining commodity prices and drought. We had nine inches of rain in six years—and by anyone's standard that is a drought. We did not get or indeed seek one scintilla of support from the government.

         The north-eastern wheat belt of Western Australia, which was in my electorate from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s—now, unfortunately, part of the electorate of O'Connor—had 10 crop failures in 11 years with no real recognition or special assistance for them at all. I do not doubt the severity of the drought in the eastern states. I do make the point that droughts occur everywhere and, as the Prime Minister said, drought is a feature of the Australian rural scene. That is absolutely true. It was not said in any sense of degrading the rural sector on the problems it is enduring; it is simply an absolute fact. I believe we have to do much more to encourage self-sufficiency amongst farmers to make provision for these droughts that will inevitably occur.

         If you take cores from coral off the coast of Queensland or cores from glaciers in New Zealand, it is quite clear that for eons drought has been a recurring feature of the Australian landscape. It has been accurately pinpointed that in about 1888 a drought commenced in the same areas which are affected by drought now, and it lasted for 15 years. It may very well be that this drought will last that long. I sincerely hope that whatever government is in power has the fortitude to see the required assistance through if the drought is that prolonged.

         As Abraham Lincoln said, if every city in the United States were destroyed, with not a stone left standing, rural America would rebuild every city. `But,' he said, `if rural America were destroyed, the grass would simply take it over.'

         I pay tribute to the Labor Party primary industry and resources committee, chaired by the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods). This committee was one of the big driving forces behind the government's package. The member for Page, the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), the member for Richmond (Mr Newell), the member for Paterson (Mr Horne), the member for Calare (Mr Simmons) and Senator Sue West from New South Wales were very vocal and very strong in support of their belief that something must be done for these people.

         I want to touch on something the member for Parkes said, because I thought it was a cheap shot and appallingly ignorant. He talked about Senator Bob Collins not coming to a social security teleconference, after it had been arranged, because he was busy trying to get the numbers for uranium at the national conference. The reality is this: Senator Collins's attempt to change the uranium policy was much more important for farmers than his being at a teleconference. If we do not do something about the national current account, it is inevitable that interest rates will rise.

         Uranium mining will be worth $800 million to $1 billion to this nation if allowed to develop. I believe that it is a tragedy that Bob Collins, Julian Grill and Mr Eade, the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, were simply not quite able to muster the numbers on the day. But I believe that the work they have done will see a change to that policy. Those valuable export dollars will help to keep down the current account and contain interest rates, which are important to farmers.

When the present government commissioned Dr Garnaut to look into affairs relating to the Wool Corporation and the bungling that had gone on for years—bungling which had been supported by the member for Gwydir—I remember being at a conference to discuss this document. I have very little regard for Dr Garnaut. I believe that his book

         Anyhow, along with the member for Gwydir I attended at one of those many identikit towns that occur throughout New South Wales and said my piece. The member for Gwydir then got up and proceeded to read from the Garnaut report. During the break, following his speech, one local said to me, `Oh, my goodness, we in the National Party are so lucky to have bright people like young Mr Anderson in our ranks.' I thought to myself, `Yes, indeed, people get the party they deserve.' However, I think that is a little harsh because, while the National Party itself may be of so little intellect, I do not think rural industry and the rural sector generally are.

         But what did we have today? We had the same tinsel, the attacks, the snide remarks, the ingratitude, the petulance about what is a very good program. The member for Gwydir said at least six times, `I must agree that this snuck up on us and took us by surprise.' I gave up counting after that. It did not take us by surprise at all. It was quite clear there was a drought in New South Wales and the government, like everyone else, was hoping for rain, hoping that the problem would go away. When it was apparent that the problem was not going to go away, the government did act—and I think the government acted in time.

         I remember the member for Parkes talking about the Fraser government spending $600 million on drought assistance. I was actually drought affected at the time, but I do not remember getting any of that assistance at all, the reason being that most of it went on drought subsidies. The problem with drought subsidies is that they are simply rorted. They also drive up the price of fodder, which makes it difficult for those farmers who are not getting subsidies. It is a nonsense scheme. For the member for Parkes to come here and support drought subsidies really does, in my view, detract from his credibility. It is quite clear. Anyone who understands the free market would understand why drought subsidies are not a very sensible idea.

         What drought subsidies also do, of course, is limit the farmer's options. If he is only limited to getting a subsidy on drought, it may not be what he needs. The answer to his drought may very well be some subdivisional development on his property. So I make that point very strongly: what the government has done in steering away from fodder subsidies is very sensible. Anyone who has any understanding of how the private sector and free market works would understand why that is the case. But we have the Deputy Leader of the National Party talking about relief retention and recovery—good, rolling rhetoric. What was his solution? Drought subsidies. What a nonsense!

         It came to my notice today—and until now I have not been aware of it—that the public sector unions in Australia have circulated a request to their members asking them to agree to a payroll deduction being made to support drought relief. They conservatively estimate that this will put about half a million dollars cash into the Farmhand appeal. They are certainly to be commended for that. I am sorry that they have not had more publicity for it because I think publicity and recognition of their case is well deserved.

         We also have the opposition lamenting that the government has not done enough to help small business in country towns. I understand the plight of small business in country towns. I am grateful for support that I had from small business in Kalgoorlie when I was in the pastoral industry; it carried us through very difficult times. But there is absolutely no doubt at all that the most effective way to assist rural communities is to support the base on which they rest. The nature of the support to be provided through the drought relief payment is such that money will flow through the family directly into rural towns. Direct income to meet day to day living expenses has a multiplier effect, somewhere between 1 1/2 and two, they say. That means that every dollar spent generates into the broader economy $1.50 to $2. Most of this will be retained in those local towns. So the government has not  neglected  small business;  it  is  still there.

The member for Parkes correctly pointed to the attitude of banks in this country. I believe that the performance of the banks leaves a lot to be desired in many areas.

         In conclusion, I want to say something about commodity prices. It is quite clear that, without a dramatic improvement in commodity prices, there is going to be an ongoing problem for those wool growers who have been severely affected by the drought. The Wool Corporation, over its tenure, inflicted on rural Australia probably three Alan Bonds worth of damage to the economy. The big difference is that Alan did most of his damage overseas; the Wool Corporation did most of its damage in Australia.

         If you analyse the rising wool prices, you see that the price of wool between 20 microns and 25 microns has not significantly risen. While the prices will sustain people in a no debt situation, they are not the sorts of prices that will pay past debts or put any flesh back onto the bones, which the wool industry in Australia desperately needs.

         The wool industry is without a doubt Australia's single most important industry—not because it is the biggest industry, although if the right policies are followed within a decade it will be the biggest export industry Australia has. It is Australia's most important industry because it is diverse and because it is the biggest small business in Australia. Why is it that the price of 19-micron wool has gone through 1800c, whereas the price of 20-micron wool is battling to get much over the old indicator price? The reason is that it is being substituted by foreign wool.

         There is no doubt that Russia, which previously was a massive importer of wool, is now a large exporter of wool. Russia is putting on the market something like half the Australian woolclip in the 20- to 25-micron range, and it is clearly affecting our prices. What happens is this: top makers will buy the very cheap Russian wool. Whilst it has a fine micron rating—developed with Australian techniques and Australian genetics—it is because of many other factors,  often very tender wool. On its own it is not of much value. They mix it with good, strong Australian wool of a wider micron count and then produce an acceptable top, which is sold to the industry as merino top, with everyone assuming that it is Australian wool.

It ought to be on the record that had it not been for Senator Collins and those people who took the trouble to write submissions to him, a disaster would have befallen us, because the department's advice was to scrap controls on the export of all genetic material.

This undoubtedly has the capacity to do the long-term damage to the wool industry that recurring droughts do not do. It stops those peaks in prices which growers need. What is detrimental to growers is not the occasional year of bad commodity prices; it is year after year of slightly lower than the needed economic price.

         This issue is related to drought. It is related to the recovery of the wool industry. It is not too late to act. If we stop now, we can contain the damage. But we should have regard to history. Within 40 years of the Spanish foolishly giving a flock of their merinos to the German court as a wedding present—a daughter married into the House of Saxony—Germany had eclipsed Spain. Within 90 years of Mrs Macarthur getting a flock of Saxony merinos out of Germany, Australia had eclipsed Germany. There were other factors. But quite clearly the message of history is there. It is very important that we act now to stem that damage and that potential disaster that will be even worse than the drought.

         Tonight I want to highlight some of the inadequacies of this package. The government has failed to acknowledge that this drought extends beyond the farm gate. It is not only the farmers out there who are feeling the brunt of this drought; it is the small businesses in the country towns. They have been feeling it for two or three years—in many cases, long before the farmers were feeling it. Many small businesses in country towns extend credit, as the farmers know that the situation with their cash flow is starting to become an emergency. It is not just the farmers who need some assistance and recognition in terms of the impact of this drought; it is the small business operators.

But it is not going to make much of an impression on the huge debts which farmers will continue to owe small business.

The problem many of these small businesses find is that, when they buy from their suppliers, they have to provide their cash up front within seven days.

         The generosity of these small businesses should not be underestimated. They understand the difficulties of farming and in many cases were the first to extend credit to farmers.

         Many of these small businesses have paid enormous personal costs because of the plight they find themselves in as a result of drought.

        In other words, the real danger now is that, as these businesses fail, many of our small country towns could also fail; the entire infrastructure of these towns could collapse and so too the town itself. This will in turn add to the costs of the farming communities as people will have to travel further afield to obtain supplies. Similar thoughts have come from the Small Business Combined Association of New South Wales. Its press release states:

Wheat producers are simply not interested in exposing what crops they may have to a competition.

         One of the iniquitous situations facing many farmers who have been able to put money aside in what are called income equalisation deposits—and according to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) there is something like $130 million currently in those deposits—is that when these IEDs are withdrawn there is a 20 per cent tax on the interest earned that goes to the government. We are debating a package of measures to assist primary producers but we find that those who have been able to put some money aside into income equalisation deposits have to pay a 20 per cent withholding tax on the interest they have earned when they withdraw that money. I would have thought that this is an area that the government would have addressed as part of this drought relief measure.

         We are not going to deny this bill passage at the second reading stage but I would commend to the government the amendment which the opposition has moved. We believe that the small business sector in country towns is being adversely affected by this drought. The drought goes far beyond the farm gate. Many small business, rural operators and contractors, whether they are crop sprayers or crop harvesters, are feeling the impact of this drought. They cannot get access to these assistance measures. I urge the government to pick up our amendment and recognise the plight that the small business sector is confronted with as the drought has rolled on beyond the farm gate into the small business sector.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to put a riddle to you tonight. When is a person who is not liable to pay tax to the federal government taxed by the same government? The answer is when pensioners, who have small work accident compensation awards, the interest upon which still does not bring them up to a taxable income, have huge slabs of their compensation awards taken out in tax. To paraphrase the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), let me put this simply so that even members of the government can understand.

         The background is a High Court decision of last December which found that the interest on moneys held by the Victorian Accident Compensation Tribunal, now called the Victorian Workcover Authority, for injured workers or the relatives of workers who died on the job, was taxable. There is no problem with this decision, as such. The problem has been with the implementation of the decision.

         The Australian Taxation Office was originally demanding  $40 million in tax on the taxable income of the funds held by the authority between 1986 and 1993. That taxable income was $99.2 million. The $40 million included penalties for late payment. As a result of negotiations between the tax office and the authority following the unsuccessful High Court appeal by the authority, the tax office scaled down its demand to $20 million in tax, waiving penalties and the 1986 tax year entirely.

         The authority then deducted tax on all its funds held in trust for around 20,000 beneficiaries. It appears that the authority failed to determine whether any of the individual trusts, of which there are around 7,500, belonged to individuals who are not liable to tax because they did not earn enough. Two weeks ago all the beneficiaries received notices of the amounts deducted in payment of tax to the tax office. People who were old age pensioners or on widow's pensions were shocked to find that their accounts had proportionally large amounts deducted from them in tax. Let me give one example.

         Mrs Smith—this is not her real name—is 80 and has a widow's pension. Her husband died at work in 1975 and she received $11,000 in compensation which was held in trust by what is now called the Victorian Workcover Authority. The balance of money held in trust for her was, until two weeks ago, $4,000. She has been taxed $1,347.85 on the interest received from 1986. Yet, even when we include the amount of interest earned, Mrs Smith did not earn enough in this period to be liable to pay any tax.

         This is where we come to the catch-22. The Taxation Office says that it can only deal with amendments to previous tax returns filed by a taxpayer. As Mrs Smith has legitimately not filed any tax returns in this period because she owed no tax, she is precluded from obtaining a refund of what should never have been paid in the first place. So Mrs Smith is paying tax contrary to current tax legislation.

         What this comes down to is a rapacious tax office hungry to fasten its giant claws onto tax whenever it can. The tax office has wielded the big stick against the Victorian Workcover Authority which appears to have agreed to take tax from the funds of beneficiaries without inquiring into whether those beneficiaries were even liable to pay tax. Under the Income Tax Assessment Act, the tax office has no authority to demand tax from people whom the same act declares not to be liable for the payment of tax. The authority concedes that it has no idea of the financial circumstances of the beneficiaries in its 7,500 trusts. All it needed to do was write to the beneficiaries asking them to produce evidence that they were not liable to pay tax. It did not do so.

         For this reason it is difficult to see how it has acted in the best interests of its beneficiaries, as is the first legal requirement of a trustee. The tax office has treated the authority as the trustee of a pool of funds. This is in fact not the case because each award was separate and created an entirely separate trust, of which the authority was only the overall trustee. The result of this scandalous implementation of the High Court decision is an unethical agreement or arrangement that penalises those with least money in the community, many of whom are elderly. On behalf of these people, I demand that the government enact some of its social justice principles to rectify a shameful wrong.

We are talking about families who have broken down and the financial support for the children who are caught in the middle of separation or divorce. This is an extremely sensitive issue which can elicit much acrimony between parties.

For that reason we on this side of the House particularly are very proud of the replacement of the dependent spouse rebate with a home child care allowance. Essentially, it means that $60 is payable in cash every fortnight to the dependent spouse, generally the carer of the children. Considering the hardship of bringing up a family in the modern world, particularly with high rates of unemployment such as those in my electorate, I am sure this allowance is welcomed by many people.

         I find it quite alarming that people who receive the allowance and who depend on government housing in New South Wales are disadvantaged by the fact that the state government of New South Wales treats this home child care allowance as added income. People who receive the equivalent of $1,500 per annum, which is the maximum amount, are now having that included as part of their assessable income. So they are losing in the order of $3 to $5 a week because their rent has been put up by the New South Wales state government.

I believe it is quite despicable that the state government implemented this new rule for assessable income. It certainly goes against the whole concept of assisting families.

         Let us look at how the dependent spouse rebate was traditionally regarded. The benefit was derived at the end of a financial year in the form of a tax deduction and perhaps a refund. The money was often used to pay off the home loan or whatever, but it certainly was not used as it was intended—to support the children of Australia. That is one of the major reasons why the government changed this policy. Cash is being made available every fortnight to the children and the mainstay of the family, generally the wife, to ensure that those small items that are necessary—whether they be school excursions or something for the children—can be purchased.

I urge all members to take note of what the Premier of New South Wales and his cabinet are doing to those families. It is certainly a very unworthy act.

The closure of these grades in Julia Creek means that the only way these children will receive an education is if their parents send them to boarding colleges or if they receive their education by correspondence. Correspondence is not a viable alternative in secondary education. It may be in primary education but it most certainly is not in secondary education. Parents are simply not qualified to teach their kids in a meaningful way. Try as we might, we will not be able to deliver those sorts of services adequately.

Families will get $2,500 from the federal government and they are entitled to only $2,300 from the state government, a total of $4,800. If the cost of travel is added to the cost of boarding of $8,280, the figure amounts to over $9,000—a shortfall of $4,000 per person. If the average family has two or three kids—if secondary schooling is given to one child it has to be given to the other children as well—they will not be able to have a secondary education.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. I know that you rarely get the honour to take the adjournment debate in the chair, and I do not want you to feel unappreciated. It is interesting that the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) has mentioned the rationalisation of rail services in Queensland. I would like to bring up exactly the same thing in relation to New South Wales.

         I find that in my own electorate over recent years the state government has certainly rationalised rail services. It has cut a number of jobs to the extent that we find that stations that were previously manned—or should we say `personed'—no longer have attendants. We cannot buy a ticket from an attendant.

         referring to a `ticket switch to hit 11 railway stations'. What happens now is, instead of going to an attendant to purchase a ticket, we can go to the station and get change and advice, but then we have to go to a ticket vending machine to purchase the ticket. Of course, the state government in New South Wales claims that this is not to reduce staff.

         Previously we went there, paid the money and bought a ticket. Now we have to go there, change a $10 note, get the change and go along to a machine to purchase a ticket. That obviously represents good government! It is absolutely ridiculous. The next step will obviously be to say, `People who come here have change in their pockets. They go straight to the ticket vending machine, and they no longer need the person. We may as well remove the person.'

         This becomes very difficult because, occasionally, a person will come along who really wants to find out how to get a train to Hornsby. They cannot talk to the machine—they can, but it will not answer them. This is a ridiculous state of affairs.

         What do we find has happened? Previously, until three weeks ago, we had a whole centre there employing about 250 mechanics to service the diesel locos. They are now being replaced; those people have gone. We find that we have new Explorer trains, which have been imported from England—despite the fact that in the Hunter we have an excellent railway constructing facility. The Tangaras were built in Newcastle. We have exported them overseas. Yet the New South Wales government does not want to purchase them, so it went ahead and bought the Explorer from England. Where are the Explorers being taken to be serviced? Every second week they go to Sydney to be serviced. This is the sort of loyalty that the New South Wales government has to the Hunter region.

        Corporate services running costs vary across the portfolio as a percentage of running costs for each agency within the portfolio. This is a function of the range of different activities undertaken within those agencies, and within the corporate services areas of the agencies. For example, the Department of Human Services and Health corporate services cost is 27 per cent of departmental running costs.

        Following receipt of support for ratification of the Convention from the Board of Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in December 1993, in March 1994 I wrote to State and Territory Labour Ministers requesting advice on whether their laws and practices complied with the provisions of the Convention. To date, I have received formal responses from all Ministers, except Victoria, indicating that consultations were underway within their jurisdictions, and that reports would be provided in due course. Victoria and South Australia indicated at the May 1994 Labour Ministers' Council that they had difficulties with the Convention as a target for ratification at this stage.

        I also wrote to the ACCI and the ACTU seeking their views.

        All jurisdictions, except New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have formally agreed to ratification. New South Wales has to resolve a number of interpretation issues before being able to consider providing formal agreement to ratification. Tasmania has identified two relatively minor compliance problems, which should be overcome when relevant new legislation is adopted. The Northern Territory considers that it complies, and may be able to agree to ratification shortly. Several jurisdictions have sought confirmation from the Commonwealth on the interpretation of one of the provisions of the Convention. This is presently being addressed.

        I am advised that the answer is not known. While the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs maintains statistics on the number of applicants for residence on spouse grounds who entered Australia on prospective marriage visas, these statistics do not separate out those whose visa was in effect at the time of application from those whose visa was not in effect. However, persons in the latter category would normally be required to maintain their relationship for two years prior to being granted a permanent visa, unless they were able to establish their eligibility under the death of spouse, domestic violence or child maintenance provisions.

        Australia is able to grant extradition to countries to which the Extradition Act 1988 applies. Application of the Extradition Act to a country gives legal force to extradition arrangements concluded by Australia with another country. These arrangements are of different kinds, with bilateral treaties being only one example. Thus the Extradition Act may be applied to give effect to bilateral extradition treaties, various `less than treaty status arrangements', British extradition treaties dating from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries inherited by Australia, and extradition obligations arising under multilateral conventions. A special extradition relationship exists with New Zealand: the Extradition Act requires the endorsement of New Zealand arrest warrants rather than the more involved extradition process that all other countries are required to follow in seeking extradition from Australia.

        A number of multilateral conventions to which Australia is a party require parties to either prosecute or extradite persons found in their territory for convention offences. These conventions deal with matters such as safety of aircraft, protection of diplomats, suppression of drug trafficking, genocide, torture and protection of hostages. To this end Australia has applied the Extradition Act to those countries who are parties to these multilateral conventions to which Australia is also a party to allow for extradition in relation to specified convention offences. Convention offences include aircraft hijacking, drug, torture and genocide offences.

       Countries with which Australia has succeeded to extradition treaties entered by the United Kingdom. These treaties were entered by the United Kingdom during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is not certain whether all countries listed below consider themselves as having treaty relations with Australia in respect of extradition treaties entered by the United Kingdom. Doubts as to the status of treaties also arise in relation to those states that have ceased to exist such as in the case of the former Czechoslovakia.

        All extradition treaties, arrangements and other extradition mechanisms between Australia and other countries operate subject to Australia's Extradition Act 1988. The Extradition Act creates a mechanism for the processing of extradition requests in Australia. The Act sets out the matters which Australian courts have to consider before ruling on a person's eligibility for extradition. The Act also sets out the matters which the Attorney-General must consider in deciding whether a person is to be surrendered to another country. The Act contains all the internationally accepted human rights safeguards which are now a part of modern extradition.
