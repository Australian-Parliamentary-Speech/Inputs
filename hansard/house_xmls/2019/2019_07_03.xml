              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 16 May 2019, of the Honourable Robert James Lee (Bob) Hawke AC, a Member of this House for the Division of Wills from 1980 to 1992 and Prime Minister from 1983 to 1991, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Prime Minister to speak at this dispatch box in this chamber in this magnificent parliament building was Robert James Lee Hawke. But that meant he was also the last Prime Minister to do so at the despatch box in the House of Representatives chamber in the old Parliament House down the hill. In so many ways, not just in that physical way, he took our country from the old to the new. He was personal enough that every Australian felt connected to him, regardless of their politics, and big enough that we actually entitled an era after him—the Hawke era.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at his memorial, which I was very grateful to the Hawke family and to Blanche for being invited to participate in, Australians loved him just as he loved them. There was a great romance that played itself out in every part of this land with Bob Hawke. They knew each other, he and the Australian people. They forgave each other. They understood each other's virtues and they identified with each other's weaknesses. In Bob Hawke's own words, it was a 'love affair'—and, indeed, it was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1983, Bob Hawke campaigned on the slogan 'Bringing Australia Together', and so he did. From 1983 to 1991, Bob Hawke led a government that redefined our nation for a modern age—floating the dollar, regulating the financial system, admitting foreign banks, dismantling tariffs and starting the privatisation of government owned businesses, microeconomic reform in partnership with the states and territories and retirement incomes for all workers. With sights firmly fixed on the long term with his team, Bob Hawke opened up the Australian economy to the world, increasing competition and laying the foundation for a quarter of a century and more of economic growth that continues to this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, of course it might not have seemed that way during the dislocation of the 1980s and the recession of the early 1990s, but our country had certainly, at that point, turned outward under his leadership. And I also wish to acknowledge that this work was done in a partnership, most significantly with his Treasurer Paul Keating. But it was also a work that was largely, almost completely, supported by those who sat in opposition. Now this was achieved by Bob Hawke's leadership, and that's what I acknowledge; his leadership to embrace common sense, common good, economic reforms, to make Australia stronger and to bring Australians together for that purpose. He had many fights whether in this place, within his own ranks of his own party, or outside this place, but such was his passion, such was his commitment, such was his determination to see the future of Australia going down a common path that it will be forever to his credit and we will be forever in his debt. And as a result of his vision and commitment, the tempo and direction of this economic reform agenda that indeed started under the Hawke government has continued long after that, to this day under my government and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The achievements of government under Bob Hawke were not just economic, they were social as well. After all, economies are meant to serve people. He understood that. They make those great social reforms possible. They were landmark social reforms made possible by that economic success, social reforms that became embedded in our national life, and now, in so many cases, enjoy bipartisan support that was not present when they were initiated. The Medicare card we all carry in our pockets is a reminder of his great contribution, and its promise of universal access is an achievement that has stood, and will always stand, the test of time, as does the outlawing of gender discrimination in the workplace. There was the listing of the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves—what we know as the Gondwana Rainforests—the Wet Tropics of Queensland and the Uluru national park on the World Heritage List, and the handback of Uluru to the traditional owners, the Pitjantjatjara people. His work, along with health minister Neal Blewett, ensured Australia's response to the AIDS epidemic was the best in the world. Tens of thousands of people are alive today because of those efforts. And abroad he stood against apartheid, committed Australian forces to the liberation of Kuwait and was pivotal to the establishment of APEC, which endures to this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was the most electorally successful federal Labor leader in our history, the winner of four successive elections, and is our third-longest-serving Prime Minister. But like John Howard, I agree that he was Labor's greatest Prime Minister. Now Bob Hawke would never accept that. He would say that that honour belongs to his hero, and the hero of so many in this place, John Curtin. And there is no doubt that war takes a great toll on prime ministers—and with that sacrifice with John Curtin there will always be great, great honour—but what Bob Hawke did with peace and in peacetime I think was the greatest tribute you could pay to those who fought for it, including John Curtin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some say that the path of Bob Hawke was a destiny prewritten. That was certainly what his mother believed, and his father too. When pregnant with Bob, his mother repeatedly found herself drawn to the words of Isaiah:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government will be upon His shoulders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a legend he felt entirely comfortable with. But destiny was not an easy partner for Bob Hawke. We know that through the well-told story of his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Bob Hawke always revelled in his belief about the purpose of his life. It's a good thing. When he was asked to conduct Handel's 'Messiah' for his 80th birthday, which those of us who were there were able to relive, Bob felt he had to remind people that the music was actually not about him—not terribly convincing, though! When we look at the extraordinary events of 3 February 1983, one might just have to wonder. A day like none other in Australian politics in many respects: a Prime Minister seeks an early election, a Governor-General makes him wait and wait, and a Leader of the Opposition resigns. He was Leader of the Opposition for just 36 days—no doubt a great mercy! In a coincidence, the current Leader of the Opposition equals that record tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was to our country's fortune that Bob Hawke seemed to have more than his share of luck. When he took office, the drought broke and, of course, Australia emerged from recession—welcome developments. We only pray that that will happen now in terms of the drought. On 26 September 1983, little more than six months into the Hawke government, the nation was galvanised by an unlikely triumph in sport that we all remember. I was a young teenager at the time and I can still remember that morning. It seems like yesterday. In my mind's eye, I can still see him at the Royal Perth Yacht Club—the joy, the exhilaration, the chaos—a reformed teetotaller drenched in champagne. That gaudy red, white and blue jacket emblazoned with the word 'Australia'—how good was that! Sadly, they don't make prime ministerial jackets like that anymore. We can hear his laughter, see the way his body wrenched around, and hear a bold declaration that reminded us that this Prime Minister was very much one of all of us. Whoever we were, whatever background we had, wherever we sat within the great spectrum of Australia, he was always one of us. He was pitch perfect for the times, fearless, brash and Australian. As Australia beat the world, he was so comfortable about who we were—signature notes for the advancing tide of 1980s optimism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If destiny was Bob Hawke's friend, he understood, as I said, it was not a passive relationship. The call to do great deeds is itself a burden, a silent contract involving an obligatory call to discipline, sacrifice and restraint, which he exercised. Bob Hawke, for all of his powers of reasoning, could also be pretty acutely visceral. A few journalists understood that from time to time, as I'm sure people on both sides of this chamber did. He had a capacity to feel, to not disguise or hide his emotions. He shed tears at times. He rose to anger. He expressed joy. He was emphatic as well, but maybe that's because he had his own share of pain. As a boy, he watched his only brother die of meningitis. As a young father, he carried an infant son, his namesake, to his grave—a pain so dreadful he could not visit his own son's grave for almost 20 years. Of course, he was fiery too. There were tears he shed over his daughter's struggle with substance abuse and the tears he shed for the victims of Tiananmen Square as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through it all, we saw the totality of the man, his authenticity and imperfection. He never hid it. I'm told of a story—it may be apocryphal; I'm not sure, but I'm pretty convinced it's true—that on one occasion at Kirribilli House the AFP officer on duty on the day, who was tasked to bring forward the papers and put them in the vestibule at the entry to Kirribilli House, one morning got to see all of Bob Hawke as he opened the door in all his glory. The AFP adopted a different protocol for launching the submission of those documents each morning with greater care so as not to be exposed to the full glory of the great Robert James Lee Hawke. He did never hide himself, physically or otherwise, and Australians loved him for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In honour of the life and service of Bob Hawke I am pleased to announce today that the government will provide $5 million to the existing endowment fund of the General Sir John Monash Foundation to create an annual scholarship known as the Bob Hawke John Monash Scholar. The scholars chosen by the foundation will study in any field deemed in the interest of the nation. The aim will be to support, for up to three years, talented young Australians with ability and leadership potential to develop their skills at leading overseas universities. We believe that this is an appropriate way to recognise the memory of such a great Australian—to see it lived in the lives of many great Australians who will follow in his footsteps in this regard in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the government and indeed this parliament and the nation I sincerely want to extend to Mr Hawke's widow, Blanche, and to his family the deepest sympathies of our country. We share and thank you for caring for Bob through the long sunset of his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again today, as I did on the day that he passed, Jenny and I particularly want to acknowledge the support and contribution of the late and wonderful Hazel Hawke, who was a tremendous support and inspiration to Bob and his family, and who is also deeply and sorely missed by a nation who loved her. Australia is grateful for the leadership and service of Robert James Lee Hawke. Australians can all rejoice for his life. Having served his country tirelessly, diligently, selflessly and passionately, may he now rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his generous comments not just today but at the memorial service at Sydney Opera House, which was a remarkable event for an extraordinary Australian. I also welcome the announcement by the Prime Minister of the government's Bob Hawke scholarship foundation. It is, indeed, appropriate to recognise a young person and to give them support in Bob Hawke's name, because Bob Hawke was always supportive of young people coming through. I first met him as the president of Young Labor, meeting with him about policy issues. At the time Young Labor didn't always agree with Bob Hawke—it must be said—but he was always encouraging. He was a mentor and, indeed, a very dear friend, and he is missed on a personal level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was the first Prime Minister in this new parliament. If you close your eyes for a moment you can picture him by the dispatch box—that famous cumulus of hair, that impish sparkle in his eyes and that voice. He towered in this place with the confidence of a man who'd always felt destined for it. Bob had long known that he wanted to be the Prime Minister of Australia. More importantly, he knew he would be. How could it be otherwise? Family legend always had it that when Bob's mother, Ellie, was pregnant with him her Bible fell open at Isaiah, chapter 9, verse 6:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between this early touch of Messiah and the clarifying effects of a near death experience on his motorbike years later, Bob had a sense of destiny. Bob was a genuine folk figure long before he became the Prime Minister. He was indeed the first politician who built a reputation on TV before he became a parliamentarian. Once asked how he could simultaneously be president of the ACTU and president of the Australian Labor Party, he replied with remarkable candour and in typical Bob style, 'If you can't ride two horses you shouldn't be in the bloody circus.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Doubt was not a regular visitor to Bob's mind, and he wasn't keen on it from others—but that doesn't mean that no-one felt it. As a Hawke prime ministership grew ever more likely, some were worried. His talent and the sharpness of his economic mind were not questioned, but mightn't his larrikin streak embarrass us domestically and on the world stage? Never mind the future, what about the risk of damaging revelations about his past? With the cheer of someone who'd once explained that he had credibility because he didn't exude morality, Bob pointed to his biography and said there would be no shocks. 'It's all in the book,' he explained. But the strength of personality sometimes masked his dedication to his work and to detail—the payoff of habits formed in his long, hard years as an industrial advocate. All this energy was channelled into making life better for his fellow Australians. He was at once our leader and our cheerleader. He was ahead of us, calling us on, and yet somehow he was also walking alongside us and, for good measure, giving us an encouraging push from behind. Bob was hardly a stranger to ambition, but his ambition embraced the rest of us. He knew we were capable of better and he knew we could do it together. Think of some of his bywords that characterised his leadership. Reconciliation, accord, consensus—they're all about us heading in one direction as a nation, rather than about division or conflict, and even though he was Labor to the core, you didn't have to vote for Bob to feel the love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was no one-man band, of course. When Labor was swept to power in the first of his four election victories, Bob was blessed with a ministry of rare breadth, depth and talent, the political equivalent of a greatest hits collection. The Whitlam dismissal was the energy that had driven some of them into politics, but it was never going to steer them. This was no time for crash or crash through. Bob; Paul Keating, his Treasurer; and their team had a clear and urgent agenda to rescue Australia from what they saw as a moribund state, but they knew how to implement it and how to sell it. Their energy was coupled with pragmatism, their courage with intelligence, their impatience with clear heads. They were united in the quest for an open, competitive, free society and an intelligent, creative, benevolent nation. They foresaw the Asian century and the rise of China and they prepared Australia for it. They saw our future prosperity depended on Australia becoming a confident, outward-looking nation. They laid down the foundations of a robust, vibrant economy that has repeatedly withstood forces that have felled other economies in our region and throughout the industrialised world. Ponder some of their achievements: APEC; the floating of the dollar, putting Australia in a position to benefit from global economic engagement; the Sex Discrimination Act; the affirmative action act; the return  of Uluru, the physical heart of the nation, to its traditional owners; universal superannuation; Landcare; Medicare. When they were elected to office, three in every 10 Australians finished high school. When that period of government ended, the figure was eight out of 10—a revolution in opportunity for young Australians. So many more young people also had the opportunity to attend university. There was the Antarctic, never to be militarised, never to be mined. In Tasmania, the Franklin River still flows, wild and free; and there was the Daintree, in Far North Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among his exploits on the world stage, Bob was the driving force behind what South Africa's then finance minister described as 'the dagger that finally immobilised apartheid'. He drove that agenda on the global stage, and it was not a uniform agenda—far from it. It took courage. When Nelson Mandela arrived in Canberra, he said, 'I want you to know, Bob, that I am here today at this time because of you.' What a tribute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fighting apartheid was just one manifestation of Bob's loathing for racism. He knew our strength lay in unity and he was always ready to fight those who sought to divide. When the dog whistle of racism was blown loudly, Bob responded in parliament with thunder. Last year, three decades later almost to the day, parliament united right here around Bob's words to condemn another politician who tried to divide us. That day in this place matched the vision Bob had for us—the Prime Minister shaking hands with the opposition leader, Muslim embracing Jew, all united in the knowledge that racism has no place among us. I spoke to Bob about that day—he was thrilled. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What can all of us here learn from Bob? Don't fear risk. Don't let the word 'no' be your first instinct. Persuade people, bring them with you. Be among the people who chose you to represent them. Listen. Engage. Stay true to your philosophies and make them the bedrock upon which you build your policies. You won't get agreement all the time but you will get respect. Bob showed us the dividends of a political life lived that way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the decades after he left office, Australia's affection for him not only didn't dim; I think it actually grew. The year that he turned 80, Bob was walking out of the MCG with delegates to the annual American Australian Leadership Dialogue when a passing car slowed down. Its young driver yelled out, 'Hawkie, you're a bloody legend.' Bob's reply was both gracious and practical: 'Well, if I'm such a bloody legend, why don't you give me a lift back to the pub?' With that, the former PM hopped into a car, no security, with perfect strangers and sped off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the American delegates with their security was gobsmacked: 'That could never happen in America.' And indeed it wouldn't. It is a perfect Australian story. I hope we never lose that character. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later that year, during his birthday celebrations, Bob stepped out onto the stage of the Sydney Opera House, of course, to conduct a number from Handel's <span style="font-style:italic;">Messiah</span>. It's quite extraordinary when that was shown at the memorial service at the Sydney Opera House. One of the songs in <span style="font-style:italic;">Messiah</span> includes the biblical line that had leapt out at Ellie a lifetime earlier: 'and the government shall be upon his shoulder.' But, fittingly, it was the Hallelujah chorus that Bob conducted: Handel's joyous expression of a prophecy fulfilled. There was a lot of love in the room that day—a perfect snapshot of the long romance between one Australian and his compatriots. Today, in the national parliament, we remember a genuinely national figure: Australia's greatest peacetime Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and it's right that we do so in this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal level, I also remember a generous mentor and friend. When Karen Middleton asked me who should launch the biography that she had written of me, I said, 'My first option is Bob Hawke.' She said, 'What if we can't get him? 'Who's your second option?' I said, 'Bob Hawke.' 'Who's third?' 'Bob Hawke.' It was the great honour of my life to have left this chamber on the day that that occurred. I went down to the office and There was Bob. He had the copy of the book and it had Post-it Notes all through it. It had little notes—he had read every word and done a remarkable job, and the fact that he did that was incredibly humbling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also say, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that our party—and our movement—remembers our great fallen chief. He transformed Labor so that Labor could transform the nation. He took on internal fights and won them so that he could lead the nation. He taught us also how real reform occurs: you require successive victories. He was Australian Labor's most successful leader, with four election victories, which consolidated those reforms like Medicare and superannuation so that they couldn't just be wound back easily. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, of course, also that he never stopped singing 'Solidarity Forever'. He particularly used to get to the line 'Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight?' The music is done now. In the quiet that has fallen we farewell this giant, a beloved Labor leader, our most popular Prime Minister—a man who in so many ways was Australia amplified. We farewell him not with sadness but with gratitude and with love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our gratitude and love also go to his children Susan, Stephen and Rosslyn, who had to share their dad with the nation, and to the memory of little Robert Jr, who, tragically, never got the chance; to Blanche d'Alpuget, who was for Bob love's second great blossoming and cared for him so compassionately during his later years; to the memory of Hazel Hawke, who was Bob's first great love; to the memory of Clem and Ellie Hawke, who raised their son to turn his back on hatred and embrace the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity. And, finally, we turn to that driver outside the MCG that night and we say: 'You were right. Bob Hawke? Legend.'</span>

                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I acknowledge the gracious words of both the Prime Minister and the opposition leader this morning as we rightly and appropriately honour the Labor Party's longest-serving Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hon. Robert James Lee Hawke, AC, joined the Labor Party in 1947 at the age of just 18. His early interest in working conditions can be seen in his choice of thesis, on wage fixing in Australia, an interest that in fact drew him away from his doctoral studies to take up a research job with the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1957. Barely a decade later, Bob Hawke was elected president of the same ACTU in 1969. No-one could question his empathy for his fellow people, his fellow Australians, as we heard from both the Prime Minister and the opposition leader. Our memories range from his pursuit of wage increases to that grand image of the celebrations of Australia's breaking of the America's Cup drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, speaking of breaking the drought, Bob Hawke ascended to the high office of Prime Minister in March 1983, when one of our worst droughts on record was into its fourth year. And the rain began to fall, first over his birth state of South Australia; torrential thunderstorms over country that had been drought stricken just two weeks earlier. A powerful monsoon moved into the west and south coast of New South Wales, then western Victoria, Gippsland and eastern Tasmania. March 1983 was the wettest that the Mallee and Wimmera regions had experienced since 1910. Eastern Queensland missed out, but not for long. The autumn of 1983 drenched the whole Queensland state. By May, much of the Darling Downs was flooded. Spirits were lifted. Farm industries began their long recovery. Australia's economy displayed new green shoots of growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke is rightly seen as an economic reformer, floating the Australian dollar, allowing in foreign banks, founding APEC, the Asia-Pacific cooperation forum, to promote growth in the region. Indeed, Prime Minister Hawke and Treasurer Keating produced a budget surplus. Sadly, other factors proved this period to be a precursor to a recession. But it's true that one of the great legacies given to Australia by Prime Minister Hawke was Labor's most recent budget surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a particular measure of the man that, in the early times after he was elected, Bob Hawke was fair dinkum with the Australian people in acknowledging that the breaking of what was said to be the worst drought since 1904 had helped build a platform for the economic reforms of the 1980s. In an interview with John Laws on 5 March 1984, the Prime Minister spoke of 140,000 jobs created. He said unemployment, interest rates and inflation were all trending down. Laws asked, 'Do you think the breaking of the drought had an effect?' and, to his great credit, Bob did not try to argue the point. 'Yes, obviously the breaking of the drought has helped,' he said. 'I've made it clear all the way along the line that the breaking of the drought and the United States's recovery have been pluses.' These times were an opportunity to take big steps impacting trade returns—floating the Australian dollar, as the member for Grayndler has pointed out—and Bob Hawke was bold and strong enough to do just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we're continuing to build crucial trade openings, not least through major free trade agreements in recent years, to build on the economic reform steps taken forward by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating, and I certainly acknowledge that. But there wasn't universal agreement on economic policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A rally of farmers outside Parliament House in 1985 was the largest and most vocal ever seen. The front page of my local newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Advertiser</span> at Wagga Wagga, on 2 July 1985—I was working at the paper back then—had a single photograph. It was an aerial shot, from a plane well up in the sky, with farmer protestors stretching as far as the eye can see. There were an estimated 45,000 in angry protest over the crippling weight of one new tax after another. A full eight pages of coverage quoted farmer after farmer and those associated with these industries from across the Riverina. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can well remember my mother, Eileen, in her later years saying that that was the only time my late father, Lance, ever protested. Dad wasn't the sort of person to protest. He was the captain of the Brucedale fire brigade and he got involved in the community. He did not believe in protesting, but, indeed, he did that day. He came to Canberra. It was the first time he'd ever attended a rally of that kind or any kind. But do you know what Bob Hawke did? He did what a good Prime Minister should do. He left the confines of this building, the safety and security of Parliament House, and went out to face the music. He fronted up. He addressed the crowd, and good on him for doing so. He probably didn't win the day, but he earned a lot of respect. He earned those farmers' respect. I can well remember dad saying just that: 'At least he showed up; at least he fronted up.' Well done, Bob. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the same Prime Minister Hawke in the firing line who backed our wheat growers. He did. It was in their time of need, just a year later, as America moved to boost its taxpayer subsidies to its own wheat farmers and undercut us in the Soviet market. This was also one of Bob's greatest legacies, certainly for rural and regional Australia. There was a massive threat to our wheat growers, along with the Canadians and Argentinians. To his great credit, Bob Hawke saw the threat and acted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Records from the time show PM Hawke protesting directly to President Reagan. In personal talks with US Secretary of State George Shultz, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Argentinian President Raul Alfonsin all backed up Australia's concerns with President Ronald Reagan. This was, I think, certainly for rural and regional Australia, Bob Hawke at his best. It was a particular measure of the man that Bob Hawke agreed to an all-party delegation from Australia to Washington. The threat was real. It was very direct. Bob Hawke had absolutely no hesitation in endorsing the idea of a cross-party lobby working the halls of Washington.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He saw it not only as a signal that his own efforts were not enough but also as a strong effort to further demonstrate Australia's concerns, and if it meant something to the farmers it meant a lot to Prime Minister Hawke. The Australian delegation won an amendment to the legislation about to enter Congress. It stipulated that any subsidised sale of wheat to the Soviets would be on the proviso that Australia maintained its traditional share of the Soviet market. The amendment was driven by Democrat congressman Stephen Solarz from New York State. There are not too many American wheat farmers there but it was readily agreed to by the bill's proponent, Thomas Daschle, who was from one of the key US wheat-growing regions. Prime Minister Hawke, along with the primary industry minister and delegation leader John Kerin, were big enough to welcome additional help to get the job done. And the job they did get done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was an advocate for the unions but it was not a blind loyalty. He took a stand on principle where he believed it right to do so. In one of the deepest controversies of the 1980s, the Builders Labourers Federation did engage in guerrilla tactics, like walking off halfway through a concrete pour, resulting in the immediate loss of millions of dollars to developers and the halting of progress. This sort of action was un-Australian. Bob Hawke knew it, and he wasn't frightened to say it. There were a lot of factors at play—not least was the future of the accord—but action had to be taken. Bob Hawke took that action. In 1986, the BLF was permanently deregistered in various Australian states by the federal Labor government. Bob Hawke led the way. It came in the wake of a royal commission into corruption by the union. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do honour today, and we do it rightly, Robert James Lee Hawke AC, a leader of great courage and great vision. We honour the longest-serving Labor Prime Minister—eight years and 284 days—for his contribution to the lives of Australians across our land mass. I well remember being at the Sydney Cricket Ground not that long ago. It seems just like yesterday. It doesn't matter what sporting event it is, they will always cheer the actors in the arena, the great sporting athletes. But as soon as they mention a politician generally, these days, they'll get hisses and jeers and boos. Not Bob Hawke—he got the beer, he sculled it, and the crowd just went off. They rose as one: 'Good on ya, Bob!' Everybody around me cheered and clapped. They thought it was just wonderful. But, even when he was Prime Minister, he still received that sort of adulation and those sorts of cheers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was the son of a school teacher and a congregational church minister. Bob Hawke sensed the need to contribute to the lives of others, to make others' lives better—to contribute to the broader community. He was a larrikin, we all know that, but he has also a Rhodes Scholar. He was the leader who sought to unite the people around him, even the farmers out there on that day in 1985. As a headline in a special supplement of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 18 May read, 'In his prime, and at the end, Hawke held his head high.' Indeed he did, and rightly so. Vale Bob Hawke. </span>

Prime Minister, can I also say thank you to you for the comments you made at Bob Hawke's memorial two weeks ago. That was a great gathering of the Labor family, led by the Leader of the Opposition. It wouldn't necessarily have been the easiest speech to make, but it really mattered to us that the Prime Minister of Australia was there to acknowledge Bob Hawke on that day. You did it with dignity and grace, and we thank you. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke led an amazing life—a magnificent painting on the canvas of Australia. As a young boy in the seventies my heroes, like many people's, were in world of sport: Lillee, Thommo, Sam Newman at Geelong, the Nankervis brothers. But for me, with an unusual—perhaps an early and some might say an unhealthy—interest in politics, Bob Hawke occupied the same space in my imagination. He was a presence on our screens that sparkled with energy: a playful smile and a fierce power of speech that was a weapon in the service of the downtrodden and the most vulnerable. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a larger than life figure, heroic, and perhaps in that youthful image there is just the smallest example of the way in which the whole nation related to Bob Hawke. From the very first day that Bob entered the public eye, oozing charisma and seriously intelligent, he began a lifelong love affair with the Australian public, the likes of which we have never seen again. I absolutely remember, as a 15-year-old on that fateful day in February 1983, being glued to the TV as then Prime Minister Fraser went to Government House and at the very same time Bob Hawke became the Leader of the Labor Party. It felt like such a portentous moment, as though we were at the dawn of a new age. Just a few weeks later this was realised as Bob Hawke was elected the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I entered adulthood and a more serious political consciousness, Bob Hawke was the main actor on the stage. And what a star he was. He embraced his union roots, but he reached out to the whole of Australia, famously speaking on the night of his election to those who didn't vote for him. He grabbed the idealism of the Whitlam era but, with pragmatism and smarts, he implemented it. He understood the power of government, in truth, the power of that side of this chamber, because that's the side that changes lives. In the process, he led the most significant peacetime government that this country has ever seen. He opened up the economy. He floated the dollar. He reduced tariffs. He greatly increased our productivity. He turned us into a trading nation and, in the process, laid the foundations for 28 years of uninterrupted economic growth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He embraced immigration. There would not have been a milk bar owner in the 1980s of Greek, Italian or Eastern European heritage who did not see Bob Hawke as an absolute hero, because he made them feel welcome. He made them feel that this was their country too—as it most certainly is. He dramatically increased school participation rates, broadened our university base and, in the process, made us a smarter country. He played his part in the reconciliation of Australia with its First Peoples. He significantly increased the status of women within our society. He left us an incredible environmental legacy: the Franklin River, Kakadu, the Daintree, Antarctica. And he had Australia take its place in international affairs as a confident nation. Playing his part in ending apartheid is an example. He played his part in seeing Australia know who we were as a nation and what we were on about in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">George Megalogenis, in his really wonderful book <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's Second Chance</span>, said about the compact of federation that it was a stunning act of self-harm, a political defence mechanism that united labour and capital by extending racial purity to industry protection. George said that Australia's political class was born thinking small.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob often remarked that since European settlement the most significant step in our nation's history has been that wave of immigration in the immediate aftermath of World War II. That, combined with his government in partnership with Paul Keating, tore done the moribund compact of federation, and in its place he put a superstructure for our nation today, for, more than any other person who has graced this chamber or this parliament, Bob Hawke is the architect of modern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so, for a young person enthused with government and politics and the power that they had to change people's lives for the better, Bob was an inspiration. Everybody who sits behind me now can articulate the ideas and the philosophies which led them to become a member of the Australian Labor Party and a member of this place. It's the same for me too. But, in addition, there is for me a deep and profound sense that I agreed with Bob, that I followed Bob, because for people of my generation Bob Hawke was the inspiration which led us to a life of public service in the Australian Labor movement. But, actually, I see Bob as the Australian embodiment of an even grander tradition, because we stand here with the deep belief that the evolution of civilised society principally occurs through the operation of progressive politics implemented from the centre. That is Jefferson. It's Lincoln. It's the two Roosevelts and the story of America. But, in a contemporary Australian sense, it is Bob Hawke who is that part of the golden thread of human development, the custodians of which in this country today are the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the year 2000 I became an assistant secretary of the ACTU. Bob in his retirement gave a lot of time to the ACTU. He used to note that it, of all the organisations and places where he had worked, was the one where he had spent the most time. As a result, I got to know Bob just a little and I really remember the first substantive meeting that I had with Bob. We sat together at a lunch at the ACTU congress in Wollongong in that same year. I was nervous—pretty starstruck, actually—about spending some time with Bob, but I needn't have been, because Bob put us all at ease straightaway. He was charming. He was engaging and interesting. He was interested, actually, in a really generous way, in us and in the people around me, and before long we were hanging on his every word and we were in the palm of his hand. I remember ringing my dad straight after. I was really excited. I felt like I'd been given a very special gift: an hour with Bob. In the ensuing years, I got that gift a few times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was pain in Bob's life. As Paul Keating remarked at Bob's memorial, this is a brutal business that we're all engaged in, and mostly we all get carted out. But there was not a hint of bitterness in Bob Hawke. He was excited to be alive. And it struck me, at the end of the day, that here was a man who was just really delighted to be Bob Hawke. I've got to say that Australia without Bob feels a little less bright. It feels a little less colourful and a little less interesting. Yet modern Australia is such a vastly better place for having been touched by the existence of Bob Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to give my condolence today to Blanche and all the Hawke family, and to thank them for allowing their man to become our great man. He was Labor through and through. He was from us. But, ultimately, he was actually much bigger than us. He was a part of the entire Australian polity. At the end of the day, he is owned by every Australian. In his passing, in the words of Edwin Stanton, spoken about another past hero, Bob now belongs to the ages.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  I thank the member for Corio for a wonderful personal address. It's a great privilege to join the other speakers and pay tribute to the Labor Party's longest-serving Prime Minister and one of Australia's great Prime Ministers, Bob Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His contribution to his country will not be forgotten. On his watch, the Australian economy became more competitive and open, as it's been said, with deregulation of the labour market, tariff reform, privatisation and, of course, the floating of the Australian dollar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On his watch, Australia stood tall on the world stage, standing against apartheid but also strengthening our relationships with our neighbours and also with our key ally, the United States. Bob Hawke developed a personal rapport with Ronald Reagan. He inaugurated AUSMIN. He was instrumental to the establishment of APEC. I also want to pay tribute to his deep affection for the Jewish people and for the state of Israel, which was a continuous thread in his public and private life. In fact, his tireless advocacy on behalf of Soviet Jews was something that will never be forgotten, and it led to a number of them being given freedom and being taken from behind the Iron Curtain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the environment, the Franklin, the Daintree, the Antarctica and the Kakadu national parks all had their protections extended, benefitting from the signature of his pen and the vision of his heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just what he achieved that was special; it was also the way he went about it and the impression that Bob Hawke left. Whether he was shedding tears of sadness when he spoke about his family, or shedding tears of joy when Australia won the America's Cup, his nation was behind him. The Australian people loved Bob Hawke. He knew it, and they thrived together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many in this place, I have my own Bob Hawke story. When I was a young student at University College in Oxford, in the main dining room there were portraits of heads of state, prime ministers and presidents who had attended that college—Bill Clinton, Harold Wilson and Clement Attlee—but Bob Hawke, who had attended that college at Oxford, had no place on those walls. A couple of years later, when I returned to Australia and I was doing my articles of clerkship—the House may find it hard to believe I was very shy and retiring back then—Michael Duffy, who was the Attorney-General in Bob Hawke's government, was there, and I went up to him and said: 'Look, you wouldn't know me from Adam, but I'd like to contact Mr Hawke. Is there any way to do it?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He took me into a small room and he then dialled Bob Hawke. He said to Bob Hawke, 'I've got this young man here who wants to speak to you about a proposition.' So I did. I said: 'Mr Hawke, I would like to see your portrait hang in University College at Oxford. As an Australian and as a former Prime Minister, you should hang there.' Quick as a flash, he said, 'That's great.' I asked who his favourite portrait artist was. He said, 'Robert Hannaford.' He sat for a number of sessions. The portrait was done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill then came. It was quite a significant amount of money. I was thinking, 'How do we put this together?' Bob Hawke, who was famous for his love of horseracing, was in partnership with John Singleton and others. Their horse won a major race. The next morning, I rang Bob Hawke and I said, 'Look, is there any chance that your friends may want to tip in for this portrait?' He said, 'Leave it to me.' He rang back not long after. He said that it was done. The portrait was flown over to the United Kingdom. Bob Hawke himself flew over. The high commissioner went from London to Oxford. The portrait now hangs in University College at Oxford for all Australians to see their great Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final word I want to leave with is to Bob Hawke's father, Clem. In 1979, before Bob Hawke had entered politics, Clem was asked about the prospects for his son. Clem said: 'Bob was as bright as a button as a boy. He is a humanitarian. Anything Bob takes on, he does well. He has a wonderful heart, sympathy for the underdog and great ideals.' Clem said of Bob, 'I think he would be a very good prime minister.' Clem, you were right. You're probably up there talking to Bob now and agreeing on one thing: your son was a great Australian Prime Minister. Rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I would like to start this condolence motion by recognising that we gather together on Ngunawal country, as is appropriate when we're speaking about Robert James Lee Hawke. Of course, he was our longest serving Labor Prime Minister and the member for Wills, in Melbourne's north, from 1980 to 1992. We know that Bob was born in Bordertown, South Australia, more than 89 years ago. He lived a life of public service and giving. I think that will be the overwhelming theme today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the words of the member for Maribyrnong, who made a statement on behalf of us all when Bob passed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With his passing, the labour movement salutes our greatest son, the Labor Party gives thanks for the life of our longest-serving Prime Minister and Australians everywhere remember and honour a man who gave so much to the country and people he cared for so deeply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A well-known quote from Bob Hawke, which I think is powerful and certainly guided his public life, was, 'The things which are most important don't always scream the loudest.' How true that is, and how important it is that all of us in this place remember it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob is genuinely mourned by Australians, those who voted for him and those who didn't. That was what set Bob apart: his ability to reach across those things that divide us and to unite Australians. The last time I saw Bob and Blanche was at the Woodford Folk Festival, along with Tony Burke, Anthony and many others. Christmas had just gone. The wonderful Blanche attended many forums. For the most part, Bob sat in what was known as the Kremlin, a collection of buildings and tents from which Bill Hauritz and his trusty team ran the festival. His body was indeed frail, but his mind was totally attentive and his eyes were lighting up with conversation. He was friendly, happy to see you, charming and compassionate—just as he was when I sat with him at the Labor Party's 20th anniversary celebration of the Hawke government at the Hurlstone Park RSL club. Bob made a rousing speech that night; it moved us all. As our leader has said, at the launch of Bob's now much-thumbed, post-it-noted autobiography, I also listened to Bob; and, like everyone else, I found his capacity completely awe-inspiring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke offered a vision of an inclusive, forward-thinking Australia. He was able to tap into Australians' sense of fairness to find the rightful place of First Nations people. He transformed the conversation on land rights and self-determination. He announced the 1987 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which examined the death of Aboriginal people in custody during the 1980s. He established ATSIC, giving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians elected representation and a say over our own affairs—huge steps forward. Despite the troubles of ATSIC in the latter years, and its abolition, Bob Hawke laid the groundwork for a voice to parliament and for self-determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob increased funding for services and programs that benefited First Nations Australians, and Bob was the Prime Minister when Uluru-Kata Tjuta was handed back to the traditional owners. At Bob's memorial, I related that, in my home, I have a rare screen-print of that hand-back, signed by the traditional owners: Reece and Cassidy Uluru, Nipper, Nui Minyintirri, Kanari and many others. Six of the signatures on that screen-print are marked with a cross. In 1988, Bob received the Barunga Statement, a statement that sits in this House. If there's one thing that every member should do today, it's go and have a look at that statement on level 1. It was a statement on bark. It called for self-determination, land rights and recognition, and resulted in the Prime Minister committing our country to a treaty-making process. Bob's response dispelled the false dichotomy and fear-mongering that Indigenous advancement meant a loss for non-indigenous Australians. Bob knew it meant advancement for all. Thirty-one years ago, Bob Hawke said of Barunga:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… in this bicentenary year, I've asked all Australians to understand that those 200 years which come on top of 40,000 years of Aboriginal culture, traditions and civilisation, that it is the Aboriginal people who were the prior occupiers and owners of this land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's incumbent on all of us in this place to make good on that very genuine commitment to advance reconciliation and make sure a treaty with First Nations Australians is delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, on a very personal note, I had the honour to deliver the acknowledgement of country at the memorial services for both Bob and Hazel Hawke. They are both very treasured memories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people have spoken about Bob's achievements, but none so far have mentioned Landcare. This month marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Landcare, one of Bob's greatest achievements. He managed to unite people across the political divide to take practical steps to protect biodiversity and natural resources, and protect the productive capacity of our country. I have a deeply personal connection here too. My late husband, Rick Farley, was part of the creation of Landcare. It's something Bob graciously acknowledged at the Landcare launch. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Today I am committing $320 million to a package of measures to apply over the Year and the Decade of Landcare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I express here my gratitude to Rick Farley of the NFF and Phillip Toyne of the ACF. They're two organisations one would probably not immediately imagine forming an alliance—but it is an indication of the importance of this issue, and an inspiring demonstration of the way forward that they used their imagination and commitment to develop proposals and put them constructively to Government. Their work has been an invaluable contribution to the creation of this new program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke knew what was really important when he said, back then:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This, ultimately, is the single task all of us in this place share. At the launch of Landcare, Bob also spoke about climate change—truly visionary—and Australia's responsibility. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I've said the environment is a global problem, and I can assure you Australia's concern for the environment doesn't end at our shores.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We will be taking the lead in developing international conventions on greenhouse gas emissions and on biological diversity.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were words not only more relevant but more urgent today. This is but one example of Bob choosing the hard task of improving Australia over easy politics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was popular and respected because he had the conviction and the strength of character to make decisions which were not necessarily popular, but which no-one could deny he was doing it in the national interest. Landcare is but one example. I want to say that Paul Kelly's article on Bob's passing accurately described Bob. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He had exceptional political qualities, enjoying high popularity for a long period, and sound judgment that saw him lead a uniquely reformist Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a consequence, Bob's legacy is all around us. You will hear it today many times: the Medicare card; year 12 completion rates; universities that are open to all based on merit; our sense of fairness; our national understanding that growth is stronger when it is shared and when the safety net for the most vulnerable is strong and generous; our modern and outward-looking economy; and the protection our environment enjoys including, as people have said, the Daintree, the Franklin and, of course, Antarctica. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was unique among prime ministers. He allowed Australians in their living rooms to see his human frailty. We all know and shared at least some of his disappointments and fears; people have already spoken about them. I don't know if it would be possible today for someone to reveal so much of themselves as Bob did but I do think it had a lot to do with why Australians could relate to him, trust him and respect him. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to leave the House with a small anecdote about Bob's kindness and care for people. Some years ago, as member for Canterbury in the New South Wales parliament, I helped Bob's stepson, Louis—Blanche's son—who was being evicted from an artist's collective in Summer Hill. Weeks later, and completely out of the blue, I got a call from Bob to thank me for helping, to thank me for doing my job and to thank me for being caring. It is a great example of the calibre of Bob Hawke. To Blanche and family, and of course remembering Hazel, we say KO to a great Australian.</span>

                  <a href="265585" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I firstly extend not only my deepest and sincerest condolences to the family, but also to you, the Labor family. You, as well as this nation, have lost a favourite son—one that will never be forgotten. When Bob Hawke became Prime Minister in 1983, I was a small boy in Western Queensland, six years old. My only appreciation of politics at that time, after my father had been elected to the Bjelke-Petersen government, was Queensland politics. But let me tell you, some years later, as I matured and understood the impact the Hawke years had in shaping our nation and shaping regional Australia, we are far richer for it. He is the father of modern Australia. Reforms that he implemented, his government, with the aid of the opposition, and the courage it took to implement those economic reforms, deregulating the financial sector, meant that there was capital that flowed for the first time into the regional communities. That meant regional communities could finally flourish and grow, by opening up to an outside world, allowing our farmers to not only trade and compete, but compete at a fair level. Bob fought for a fair go for farmers on the international stage. Opening up trade markets but making sure that we got a fair go was so important to each and every one of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of his biggest legacies that will always live on and will always be seen in regional and rural Australia is that of Landcare, and that was achieved with another great Australian in Rick Farley. That was one of the greatest achievements, I think, that regional and rural Australia will be able to look back on, because that's underpinned our sustainability and our longevity in regional and rural Australia. It took vision and it took courage to bring people from all persuasions together to look for a greater good and a good that was going to last in perpetuity. It's something that I know personally as my own family farm has benefited from the advent of Landcare. We were some of the perpetrators of some of the poorest farming practices in our district, but the advent of Landcare meant that we finally understood our country; we understood how to manage it and make it better and how to live with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in closing, let me say I think Bob Hawke personifies what's great about this country, that the ordinary can become the extraordinary. Australia has lost a truly great Australian, but we are so much richer for having him. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  I first met Bob Hawke in the mid-1970s when I was with the Northern Territory Trades and Labour Council. I was charged with the responsibility of going to an ACTU conference in Sydney to argue against the prospect of uranium mining in the Northern Territory. My remit was very clear: 'You go down there and you tell those bastards that they're not to mine uranium in our country. The workers of the Northern Territory won't tolerate it.' Of course, that was an easy measure to sell. So I went to the ACTU conference, diligently and forcefully put my case, called Bob Hawke every name in the world, and got done like a dinner. An hour or two later at the pub, Bob rocks up. 'How are you, son?' 'Fine, Bob.' He said: 'Well, no hard feelings. That's the way it is.' And for me that was the start of what became a very good and long relationship with Robert James Lee Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next week, on 11 July, we will celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the election of the 35th Parliament in 1987—the parliament to which I was elected to become a member of the Hawke government, and I am the last remaining fossil of the Hawke government in the parliament. And it was a great pleasure to be involved with him and with all of those who were involved in the decision-making processes of the labour movement and the Labor Party during that wonderful period. We've heard eulogised already, in many ways, the achievements of that great government—over those great governments, I should say. And when I stand back and look at it—I was thinking about it last night, 'What the hell am I going to say that's going to be a little bit different or add something to what others have said?' I could only think that my personal experience of the government might be useful because, despite the fact that we have these great achievements writ large—and they were terrific achievements, of that there is no doubt—and we have transformed the nation for the better and forever, it was a collective process, and that needs to be contemplated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we've got a pretty good caucus—I've been a member of a number of them—but this is not a fractious caucus; this is a unified caucus. The caucuses of bygone days were not so unified; they were very fractious. If you can, contemplate the ideological divide across the Labor movement when we were deregulating the finance industry, reducing tariffs, changing the face of manufacturing in Australia and privatising assets. Can you imagine the debates that took place within the Labor family in this House—in the old house in the first instance? They were extensive, they were difficult, they happened and they were encouraged. I can well recall meetings about the privatisation of Telstra that went on for hours; Qantas, hours. We know how to have meetings in the Labor Party. We like a good yarn. Those were the days when the Left used to go out and brief the media after Left meetings. Those were the days when the Left had a position on the budget. It was an interesting period, and I was so privileged to be part of it. Bob had such charisma that, ultimately, he was able to bring it all together. He had some great lieutenants, of that there is no question, and we shouldn't doubt them, both the factional leaders and his ministerial and cabinet colleagues. They were a wonderful support, but they argued virulently amongst themselves and in cabinet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll come to one particular issue which Bob believed may have eventually caused his own demise. We've heard the member for Barton refer to a number of important issues dealing with the First Australians. I want to talk for a moment about Landcare and recognise the member for Barton's since-deceased husband—a wonderful man, Rick Farley—and Phillip Toyne, who was a great friend of mine and someone I knew for many years. They had the capacity to work together within a framework set up by Bob Hawke to allow us to develop the national Landcare scheme. No-one would have contemplated the capacity of a Labor government to bring these forces together, moderate them and come up with a scheme with in excess of $350 million or so, yet it happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One sign of his capacity to bring the nation together was the Prices and Incomes Accord. We had come into our conversation something that, sadly, I have to say, has dropped off: the whole concept of the social wage and the ability of working people to accept less than they might otherwise get for the fact that the government was going to invest in services for them and their families—a better education, better health, better infrastructure—the sorts of things we argue for in this place on a daily basis. That conversation was had with the Australian working people. The Australian nation was involved in that conversation. What the Prices and Incomes Accord did was allow the nation, on the back of Australian workers, to go forward. We shouldn't underestimate the difficulty of that process and the importance of it and the importance of the partnership of Bob Hawke, Bill Kelty of the ACTU, and the team. It was extraordinary. Sitting as a member of the caucus, as a member of the government, watching all this happen, I was left in awe, really. I saw these great national figures, people of great personality—Peter Walsh, Kim Beazley, John Dawkins, John Button, Neal Blewett, Mick Young—replete with skill, capacity, brilliance and a willingness to achieve for the good of the whole Australian nation together. I could go on for a week, but I won't. It was such a delightful thing to do, to be a member of that government, and we should learn from it. We should learn about our capacity as a parliament to achieve great things for the nation. We should learn that we have, within us, the innate capacity to do good things; we just need to have the will to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk, in a more concentrated moment or two, about First Australians. Bob had a couple of losses. Prior to entering into this parliament, I worked with the Central Land Council in Alice Springs. Pat Dodson, now Senator Pat Dodson, was the director and I was the policy officer. It was after the 1983 election and the issue of national land rights came up. The government committed itself to national land rights and the first iteration of its proposals reinforced the strength of the land rights legislation of the Northern Territory, allowing Aboriginal people a veto, control of their land and a whole range of things within it. Then, scurrilously, the Premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke, scuttled it. We didn't get national land rights, because Brian Burke was selfish and, I might say, racist, in undermining the aspirations of Aboriginal people for national land rights and in undermining the capacity of the Hawke government to achieve that objective. He did it in partnership with the mining industry, who in those days left no stone unturned to try and overturn any rights that Aboriginal people might have to control what was happening on their land. Ultimately, the National Federation of Land Councils came together and said: 'We're not going to cop something that Brian Burke says is acceptable. We won't have it.' So they campaigned, and I was involved with Pat. We were here courting the government. We were here pressuring the government not to pass the national land rights legislation, because it would've weakened and undermined the rights of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and elsewhere. Now, that's a shame. That all happened because of the recalcitrant, selfish Labor premier. It's a fact of history. People may debate me, but I'm prepared to back up what I have to say through facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Post that period, Bob did some extraordinary things. He had this innate belief in opposing racism and discrimination. There was the creation of ATSIC. We hear the calls for a voice—this was a voice. It was dismantled, sadly, by the Howard government, but this was a voice based on regional assemblies around the country. It was a very forceful thing. It gave Aboriginal people rights, which they previously did not have. It gave them a recognition of self-management and self-determination, which was opposed, I might say, by the conservatives at the time. That's sad, but then, on the back of the meeting at Barunga and the Barunga Statement, we had the calls for reconciliation and the reconciliation council, and we had the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. They were things that would not have happened if it had not been for Bob Hawke's leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a long way to go. On 23 August 1988, we had the first substantive debates in this new parliament. The first motion to be moved was one which acknowledged Aboriginal Australians and asked for recognition and an affirmation of the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage and a whole range of other things. It wasn't supported, ultimately, by John Howard. They sought to amend the legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was given the honour to be the second government speaker behind the Prime Minister. I remember that day, and the pride with which I was able to stand at this dispatch box. And, during the course of his contribution, the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, made some seriously important observations which we need to contemplate and recognise and understand and appreciate that we can do a lot damn better. He said, in part:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Government is committed to a real and lasting reconciliation, achieved through full consultation and honest negotiation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal citizens of this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It will be recognised by the compact or treaty which we are committed to negotiating with Aboriginal and Islander people, and it will be recognised by our support for this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a commitment we have yet to meet. What is wrong with us? And, at the conclusion of his speech, he referred to some statements by a truly great Australian, someone who was a mentor of mine and for whom I worked: Dr HC, or 'Nugget', Coombs. And this is what the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What is required by government is the political will to follow through with these goals. In a recent article about the proposed treaty Dr Nugget Coombs said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">   It's a politician's job to recognise when the will is there to do something; but they also have a responsibility to create that will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again quoting Bob Hawke:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On the spurious claim that such a path to reconciliation would create division in the community, Nugget Coombs went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">   It's never divisive to correct injustice. The fact of injustice is divisive and will continue to be until we correct it and learn to live with it. People who benefit from injustice will oppose this, but you don't stop working for justice simply because people around you don't like it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That seems to me something we should all learn from.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to make some concluding remarks around something which Bob believed caused his demise and relates to the internal workings of this Labor Party. And this was the issue of Coronation Hill. Arguably the most disruptive period within the Hawke governments was this argument over mining of Coronation Hill, Guratba to the Jawoyn people, the resting place of Bula and referred to by them as the sickness country. His support for opposing mining at Coronation Hill caused a bitter feud in cabinet and caused him great conflict and argument with his closest friends. He stood up to them and he insisted—he insisted—on achieving his way, but it wasn't without great divisive debate. And I referred earlier about the attitude of the mining industry. Well, this is reflected in one Hugh Morgan, who was then managing director of Western Mining Corporation, when he likened the defeat of the proposal for mining at Coronation Hill to the fall of Singapore. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The decision on Coronation Hill is not merely bizarre, it is resonant with foreboding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Unless it is strongly resisted and overturned within a short period of time, this decision will undermine the moral basis of our legitimacy as a nation, and lead to such divisiveness as to bring about political paralysis …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you believe that? This was a leading Australian industry figure—remember, we're talking 30 years ago—and it was scandalous. But sadly he had the ear of some in cabinet, and they vociferously argued against the propositions being put by Bob Hawke. Bob has commented on this. In his memoirs, he said: 'This decision divided a cabinet and alienated the mining industry. It aroused all the passions which flare when Aboriginal rights, issues and beliefs are added to the already combustible environmental versus development confrontation.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't have time to go through all the arguments about the environment and other matters but I was integrally involved in this decision as the member of the Northern Territory representing the interests of the Jawoyn people. Ultimately, Bob Hawke said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My position on mining at Coronation Hill was accepted. This was comfortable for the more bitter of my opponents, who had the luxury of making it known that the decision represented the will of the Prime Minister and not the majority view of the Cabinet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to an article by Sid Maher in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 31 December 2015, where he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… "I was annoyed beyond measure by the attitude of many of my colleagues, of their cynical dismissal of the beliefs of the Jawoyn people."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He challenged cabinet that those who opposed the Jawoyn position essentially were saying that the traditional owners were talking—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob later said that he had no doubt that this contributed to his loss of the prime ministership to Paul Keating in December 1991.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final comment refers to that contest in 1991. There were a group of us in the caucus who were solidly of the belief that Bob should have remained Prime Minister. In the first Hawke challenge, Bob's senior colleagues all combined around him and ensured that he won. In the second Hawke challenge, they fell off like flies, and his senior cabinet colleagues went to him and said, 'Bob, we don't think you can win; you should pull out.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a group of us backbenchers, or parliamentary secretaries, who went over to the Lodge and sat down with Bob—the member for Banks, Daryl Melham; Con Sciacca; the former member for Burke, Neil O'Keefe; and me—and we said, 'Bob, what do you want us to do?' And he said, 'I want to contest this.' We said, 'We will go out and try and get you the numbers.' Now, remember, this is against the desire of his senior cabinet colleagues, his mates, who had told him to move on. There was only one of them who came out publicly supporting his position, and that was Simon Crean. We had the ballot, and Bob lost 56 to 51. It was an extraordinary outcome, really, when you consider the mountain of opposition that was being put against him by his cabinet colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have lived a very fortunate life and I've had the great honour and privilege of being in this place for a damn long time. But I cannot—cannot—leave this despatch box without saying what a great man he was. We know this because others have said it. We know it because of what was achieved and how this nation has changed as a result of what he did and what he showed us. What I say to the government now when speaking—and I see the minister at the table talking about the need for a treaty and the issues I addressed earlier: constitutional recognition and a voice—is, 'Just remove the ideological shackles and the blinkers that prevent you looking across and saying that we can do this together,' because we can, and we must. Let's not be like John Howard those many years ago. Let's make sure we reach across the table and achieve this outcome. It's a challenge for us, and we can do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Hazel Hawke doesn't get a lot of mention here but she was one wonderful woman and a great partner to Bob when he was Prime Minister. In the pilots' strike of 1989 she was due to open an art exhibition at Yuelamu, which is about 200 kays north of Alice Springs. We flew from here in a twin-engine plane via Broken Hill to Alice Springs so she could drive up the highway to do this event. She needn't have done that, but she did it. She was a great and wonderful woman, and a great partner to Bob.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Blanche, Susan, Steve and Rosslyn and their extended families: please accept my condolences and that of Elizabeth, my partner, who knew Bob well. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="208884" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PORTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I offer my deep condolences to the Hawke family and to all the broader members of the Labor family represented today by members opposite. In thinking about what to say at this moment my mind was drawn to a really beautiful essay on leadership by Isaiah Berlin. There have been lots of mentions of Isaiah today; this is a different Isaiah. He made a comparison of leadership styles, in a wonderful essay after World War II, of Roosevelt and Churchill. He described two alternatives—what I think he considered to be opposite strengths in leadership. The first was an individual completely at home, not merely in the present but perhaps even more so in the future; someone who was capable of knowing with clarity where they wanted to go, by what means and why. He described those types of people as policy innovators having a half-conscious, almost premonitory awareness of the coming shape of their own society. These were essentially people who could see clearly an outcome for how they thought the world should be and could see clearly paths around how to get to that outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he described an alternative leadership style as being anchored in the strongest possible sense of the past—what he conceived as a sort of unseverable attachment to a description he gave of a brightly coloured vision of history. He saw those types of people as being able to reflect back at their own country's people a composite reality of who they really were that very much resonated with them. It seems that what can make for particularly successful and powerful leadership is people who have both that authentic and insightful sense of who their nation's people really are and who can themselves reflect their own country's contemporary mood back at the people they represent, but who at the same time are futurists. I guess that's in the sense that they're committed to changing central parts of the social and economic landscape that they find themselves in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was Prime Minister between 1983 and 1991, obviously, and so he was the Prime Minister of the youth of many of the people here in this parliament and the Prime Minister of the youth of many Australians of generation X. As Prime Minister, Bob Hawke was clearly one of those national leaders who was able to harness that genuine love he had of his country into an energy and optimism, and reflect the best strengths of Australians back to themselves. Very fortunately for Australia, those rare personal qualities weren't squandered. As we've heard this morning, they were harnessed and utilised as a force for enormous good. The eight years of the Hawke government were eight years of government that had broad enough appeal to underwrite this amazing, energetic, risk-averse and overwhelmingly successful commitment to substantial economic reform. That's not to deny all the very significant social policy changes during that era, but it was a period in Australia's government which saw this incredible rarity of the social strength of an individual in a national leader being translated into hard-nosed economic reform. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One personal piece of evidence of the breadth of the appeal of Bob Hawke and his government became apparent to me through the actions of my grandmother. Norma was a very strong-willed woman, a lifelong dyed-in-the wool Liberal, and I recall very vividly in circa 1992, she broke her television because of Paul Keating. It's fair to say that Prime Minister Keating was not Norma's particular cup of tea, so to speak, and that she was a very passionate type—in fact, she is the genealogical link that makes the member for Kennedy and I, as well as friends, blood relatives, but that is a story for another time; by personal invitation, I will tell that story. But Norma, my grandmother, in my presence, threw what I think might have been a vase, which was proximate to her mood, at her own TV, breaking it in the process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This wasn't quite an event as spectacular as Elvis's shooting of his 25-inch RCA TV because he took offence at the singer Robert Goulet, but it was nevertheless a bit of a sight to witness your grandmother crack her own TV with a swift throw from the outfield of her living room. When I asked her why at the time—and she wasn't in the mood for longer explanations—she simply said, and it will always stick with me: 'They should bring back Bob Hawke. He was a great bloke and at least he liked cricket.' So the fact this woman, who was a dyed-in-the-wool lifelong Liberal from the other side of that voting divide, felt an obvious and genuine affection for Bob Hawke, demonstrated to me then—as have the many reflections today—and since his passing, the real power of those people who shine back through the prime ministership a genuine love of the country's people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is obviously a day for the Labor members of the House, and I'm very much looking forward to their recollections and insights, particularly from those who knew the man—and I only met him once at the WACA Ground in the President's Room on the first day of a Perth test match, and he was very generous. I want to quickly finish with the shortest possible story relating to cricket and the University of Western Australia. It was a story relayed by Bob Hawke himself on ABC Radio in Perth in 2013 and it seemed to capture a slice of the spirit of the individual man, something of a Belle Epoque in Western Australia and something of the place that is the University of Western Australia, which was a formative part of Bob Hawke's life. The story was relayed by Bob Hawke—and I might say that UWA, for those of us who've had the great privilege to spend time there, is a place of incredible physical beauty. CGI could not visualise a place more physically Eden-esque than UWA in such a uniquely Australian way. That sense of oasis must have been even more heightened in the late 1940s and early 1950s when Bob Hawke was there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you read in the John Curtin library, in the mid-1940s—and it changed a bit in the early 1950s—it was a 35-hour plane trip to Sydney. The isolation of Perth and that oasis effect at UWA must have been quite remarkable. Bob Hawke told the story of having a job as a gardener in 1952, hauling manure by horse and cart to the UWA campus rose gardens. So, a thoroughly modern Prime Minister had that as a job at UWA. On the third of these trips, the horse apparently decided it wasn't much interested in completing the remainder of the work. Bob Hawke approached this problem in a typical consensus and conciliatory way, attempting, he said, to have a word with the horse to see if he could persuade it to do what he wanted it to do. The horse wasn't convinced. It bolted. The cart tipped and ripped a pretty good gash in Bob Hawke's thigh. On that very same day, the South African cricket side was playing the Governor's Eleven at James Oval at UWA. Bob Hawke stumbled onto the field where he found the South African middle-order test batsman Roy McLean on the field. Roy promptly clasped his hands over Bob's thigh to stop the bleeding until an ambulance arrived. What a place and time that must have been, talking about brightly coloured visions of history, and what Bob Hawke lived through and what it brought to his prime ministership was remarkable. So, of course, was the way in which he was such a futurist. By his own admission, in finality, he was a pretty haphazard student during his first two terms at UWA, soaking up what campus life had to offer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The end to the story that he told on Perth radio was the one alluded to by the opposition leader—that one evening he was on his way home from university on a motorcycle and he had a quite bad accident. He ruptured his spleen, found himself on the critically ill list for a week and came very close to death. He cited that accident on his way home from UWA as a turning point where he felt that his life had been spared for a purpose and that he should make the most of it. Of course, that he very much did, as today's proceedings are testament to. So, again, my sincerest condolences to Bob Hawke's family and to all of my colleagues opposite.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I loved Bob. I loved him as an Australian, I loved him as a Labor leader and I loved him because, over the last 10 years, we became friends. We became quite close. We've already heard from people the way Bob Hawke, as an Australian, knew us and was of us and loved us. But there was also—what no speech can do to bring it together—the way Bob Hawke would fill a room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was not a tall man and every time the political barb was thrown at John Howard with the term 'little Johnny Howard', John Howard would protest that he was actually taller than Bob Hawke. But there was something in a small person's body that created this human giant the moment he walked into a room or the moment he spoke. I remember as a member of Young Labor, as a delegate at the New South Wales conference at Town Hall, when Bob Hawke would come in to address us. The beginning of the speech was always dreadful. Bob was not good at reading a fully written out speech. At some point about 10 minutes in, he'd get bored with what had been written and he would just take off. There are a number of people who can walk into a small meeting room and fill it, but not many people can fill the Town Hall. But that was the measure of Bob.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he also loved the things that we loved. One of the only moments of tension between me and Bob was one time when he offered me one of his Bob Hawke beers. Now, of course, as is common for people of Irish heritage, I'm coeliac, so there's only a couple of brands of beer that I can have that don't wreck me. And when I said no, there was a movement in Bob Hawke's eyebrows. They sharpened. I started to try to explain, and as the eyebrows got sharper and sharper I had that moment when, for the first time, I saw Bob as he looked when Andrew Peacock and John Howard looked at him—that complete 'I do not understand what you are saying to me'. And from that moment on, every time I caught up with Bob, I made sure I had some gluten-free beer that I had brought with me so that the challenge wouldn't be quite the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've talked a lot about Bob's prime ministership, but it's important that we as Australians realise the way he represented us on the world stage and, even after he stopped being in this room, kept representing us on the world stage. The Boao Forum for Asia is what China has always wanted to be the Davos of Asia—a large international conference. Bob himself was asked to be the chair of that. He had the view that, no, you needed to have an Asian leader as well, and the job was shared with Fidel Ramos. But Bob would go every year to Boao, as have senior ministers on each side of this House over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he was there, there would be one night when all the Australians were called to the stage. Australians from all different businesses—everyone from a foreign minister from Liberal or Labor through to Twiggy Forrest or whoever was there—would be called up onto the stage, and they would be obliged to sing 'Waltzing Matilda' with Bob. But there was a rule: he would hand the microphone to everyone when it came to the choruses but the moment it got to the verses he would seize it back, because only Bob was allowed to sing the verses. If anyone, even though they didn't have the microphone, tried to join in, they'd get a sharp look and they'd be told that was for him. That 'Waltzing Matilda' would be heard at events throughout Australia and the world.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one of the testaments to Bob's legacy is the fact that today we want to pretend so much of it was bipartisan. And that's a good thing. That's good that we want to remember the world as it is now. But Bob was always amused about the number of fights he had to have for things now considered bipartisan. He was okay with it. If people want to own the legacy, go for it. The truth is, he always had the view that if you were going to deregulate the economy you had to increase the security in people's lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why Medicare was fought for, and that wasn't bipartisan. That is why superannuation was fought for, which still isn't bipartisan. That is why one of the great achievements and great honours for all members of this House, and one that will always rest with Bill Shorten, is the fact that a resolution on race—that Bill Shorten had the privilege to move last year—was carried without dissent in this parliament. It was, with only one word change, exactly what had been moved by Bob Hawke years earlier, with John Howard as Leader of the Opposition insisting that it be opposed and divided on, and people like Philip Ruddock crossing the floor. I don't say that to draw back the pain of the past but to simply say let's not pretend this was easy for Bob at the time and there was sudden bipartisanship. Where Australia has got to now is so much of what Bob was fighting for then. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Australian, Bob understood so well the concept of mateship. In conversations with him late last year, when he was tired and he was frail, there was one moment where he particularly lit up. He said, 'You know, Paul and I are mates again. We've sorted it out. We've fixed it.' And he beamed. It meant so much to him, that the years of tension and difference with Paul Keating had gone full circle and the friendship was there again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love Bob because I'm Labor. For me, I joined the Labor Party because of the saving of the Daintree rainforest. It was the campaign for the Daintree that caused me to become a member of the Labor Party in the first place. We can rattle off, very quickly, the Franklin, the Daintree, Kakadu and Antarctica. Bob and I started to become friends in the years when I held the environment portfolio. We need to remember, with Antarctica, it wasn't just a simple decision. It had got to the cabinet papers. As Bob was reading his cabinet papers, on the weekend, it was already there as a recommendation that Australia would agree to mining in Antarctica. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob read it and responded with a term that is certainly not parliamentary and took it to cabinet. The advice from everyone around cabinet and all the smart people was, 'It's too late; it's done. Every other country has signed on.' Bob said, 'No, we're not doing this.' He got onto his friend Jacques Cousteau, and both Paul and Bob were involved in conversations with Michel Rocard, then the Prime Minister of France. They turned it all around. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a great privilege for the 20th anniversary of that treaty to be in Hobart with Bob Hawke and Michel Rocard, celebrating the 20th anniversary of what was and always will be the largest conservation decision in the history of our planet. There never has been before, and there won't be again, an occasion when a conservation decision of that size is made on this planet. That belongs to two men, who have both now passed away: Bob Hawke and Michel Rocard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob had never been to any of our bases in Antarctica, even though he was responsible for them. So as environment minister I managed to get him onto one of the planes. I was so happy and surprised, because I had never seen the photos, that at his Opera House memorial service one of the photos that came up was of Bob in Antarctica. I was worried at the time of him going to Antarctica as to whether or not we might get in trouble for having sent him there and whether it might become a partisan thing. It never did but, just to make sure, I made sure that the shadow minister for the environment, the member for Flinders, was also invited on the trip to Antarctica, which he didn't take up, and I've not let him know why until now. That was back when we got Bob there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warren Snowdon referred to the Kakadu decision. One of the arguments that Bob used—and this was public at the time—against his own cabinet's decisions, when the traditional beliefs of the Jawoyn people were being mocked, was saying: 'How can you expect respect for your Christian faith and not respect the faith of the people who have always been on this land on this particular issue? How can you do that?' Bob would often talk about his cabinet. He loved his cabinet. There were many times he would say to me, 'You have a good cabinet.' That was when we were in government. He was very complimentary of the frontbench that we took to the last election. But he would always pause after that and say, 'But it's not as good as my cabinet.' But notwithstanding how much he loved his cabinet, even though a majority said to go the other way, he put his authority on the line. His view was that that was the final straw in losing the prime ministership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When stage 3 of Kakadu was added to the World Heritage area, there was a gap within the boundary. It was an area called Koongarra. The reason there was that gap, Koongarra, was that the traditional owners, the Djok clan, at that point were divided as to whether they wanted it permanently protected or whether they might want it mined at some point in time. Twenty years later, the Djok clan was down to one member. There is today only one surviving member of the Djok clan, Jeffrey Lee. For all the different moments I have had in this chamber, the most special one for me, I suspect, will always be when we put through the legislation to add Koongarra to the World Heritage area and add it to the national park. Harry Jenkins was in the chair. I was the minister moving the motion. The shadow minister was in here for it. Sitting side by side, on those public gallery chairs just over there, were Bob Hawke and Jeffrey Lee. They were there to watch the next stage of the Kakadu legacy take place. When we had a media conference later that day—which never made it to evening news, but that's life—Bob took no credit for himself. His entire speech to the press gallery was about Jeffrey Lee. He is a man who could have become a multimillionaire, yet had decided to preserve his land forever by adding it to World Heritage area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as I referred to at the start, Bob and I became friends and quite close. I've never known anybody so ready to die. He was not wishing it on, but he believed that, yes, it was imminent. At the Woodford Folk Festival over summer, he said this to me many times: 'You know, mate, I won't be back. This is my last one.' He was relaxed about it. For a lot of us who were friends of his, we found this really challenging. We weren't quite as relaxed about it as he was. But he was convinced, and right, that he wouldn't be coming back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He would sit and do his cryptic crosswords each day, because he was determined to always keep his mind sharp. He would do his cryptic crossword each time. As Linda Burney mentioned, the room where it was done at the Woodford Folk Festival is their head office and, as only the Woodford Folk Festival can do, is called the Kremlin. Sitting at the Kremlin each day, Bob would be there doing his cryptic crossword. There was a view that he was probably too frail to go out to the festival this time. Instead of leading the festival in 'Waltzing Matilda'<span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> they recorded some and played it on the big screen. The crowd went wild. While he would sing 'Waltzing Matilda'<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>for the crowd outside, within the Kremlin it was always 'Solidarity Forever'. The rule was the same: don't try to join in in the verses. Our role was to help with the chorus, with fists raised, and he would take the verses for himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Towards the end of the festival, Bob turned to his great friend Bill Hauritz who, together with Amanda Jackes, runs the festival. They went out on the buggy for Bob to have a look at the festival. They went from the private area to the public area, and no-one looked. They drove the full length of the first street, and no-one had noticed. Bob was quite crestfallen and he turned to Bill and he said, 'They've forgotten.' And Bill thought, 'Well, we'll turn the corner and we'll go back.' And as they turned the corner, one person at quite a distance pointed and at the top of his voice said, 'There's Hawky.' And from that moment he was mobbed. Nothing had changed. The love that you would have seen 20 or 30 years earlier was there at the festival, with people taking selfies, people wanting to talk to him and people just wanting to say, 'Thank you, Bob.' After about 40 minutes, he said to Bill, 'Please take me back.' He'd had enough. But that moment, where he thought maybe the relationship with Australia had changed, showed that it hadn't and, even with his passing, it never will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm grateful for his friendship and grateful, through those festivals, that I got to know Blanche, Louis and Bri. I didn't get to know Hazel at any point in her life nor do I know very well Sue, Stephen and Rosslyn, but, obviously, to everybody, my condolences. I'll miss a great Australian, I'll miss a Labor leader and I'll miss my friend.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I want to start by acknowledging all of those on the other side for whom this is a very powerful and emotional day. A great figure in the life of the Labor Party and a great figure in the life of Australia has passed. He was a friend and a mentor to so many. The member for Watson gave what I would frankly describe as a beautiful speech. It was a recollection of somebody he knew well and who was one of the great icons and mentors. I might just inform the House that it looks like there's a tear in the eye—I won't give it away completely, but it does look like there is—and rightly so. The Leader of the Opposition's acknowledgement was for somebody who was a friend, a mentor, an iconic figure, but, above all else, a human figure. And that was the story for all of Australia. I'm one of so many who had the pleasure of meeting him but I wouldn't say I knew him. Those opposite did. He was their shining light—their lodestar. He was their leader and an inspiration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do remember, in September of 1983 whilst I was in my final year of secondary school, watching the America's Cup. We were all enthralled with the whole back and forth of the races and the way Bob Hawke, as the Prime Minister but also as the cheerleader of the nation, captured that spirit. For so long afterwards, it wasn't the jacket—of course, the jacket is hard to forget—it was the ethos, the passion, the joy and the fact that he was able to articulate the mood of the nation to capture it and add to it. It was such a powerful moment in Australia—a unifying moment. I don't think I remember a more unifying moment for Australia. I've said to friends and to family on occasions other than today that that was the singularity of the essence of Australia all brought together. To have somebody who could speak for the country, of and by the country, was just a wonderful sense of who he was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something else happened in September of 1983. That was also the month that the Medicare legislation, the Health Legislation Amendment Bill, passed Old Parliament House—same month, same time—one a moment of great joy; one a moment of great import. The interesting thing about that is it was only six months after the government was sworn in. As a legislative achievement, it was a landmark. As a legislative example of rapid, high-quality work, it's almost unparalleled. I was thinking through this today: that that was done within six months was extraordinary. I thought, 'I have some responsibilities in terms of the Public Service; I think I'll take that as an example.' But that Medicare has become a deeply engrained bipartisan commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only the day before the election was called, I had the privilege in this current role of signing off on the latest addition to the Medicare list—through the work of the Medical Services Advisory Committee, which is the body which administers the items that go on the Medicare list—of Kymriah. Kymriah is a breakthrough cellular immunotherapy. It would otherwise cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. But the fact that we can make this available through our hospitals for the treatment of adolescent and childhood leukaemia and lymphoma is, in many ways, the great continuum from that which was commenced in 1983. To think that back then you could have said, 'This system will, in the future, help provide not just a treatment but a potential cure for leukaemia and lymphoma'; this week I was informed that six children have already been treated for conditions that were deemed to be incurable. We await the results with hope and with prayers for their families, but with the knowledge that the system begun in 1983 continues to deliver with an absolutely passionate bipartisan commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, at the moment we have the highest bulk-billing rates on record, something of which I'm immensely proud. The member for Hasluck, the now Minister for Indigenous Affairs, and I have worked together over the last two years in this space to see a nation coming together. That is the test of successful policy—does it continue beyond one administration to the next? I want to acknowledge that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge in the health space the immensely important work that Bob Hawke and Neal Blewett did to take a proactive step at the moment that HIV-AIDS was threatening to spread dramatically not just through the gay community but through the whole of Australia. Their preventive work, which had its controversies at the time, was something of profound importance. I'm delighted to honour the memory of Bob Hawke by informing the House that today we will release figures which show that, in the last year, we have had the lowest rate of HIV infection in two decades. I acknowledge the member for Sydney, the former Minister for Health, who passionately continued the action on HIV. That continuum, that flame, across different governments at different times has meant that we've achieved that lowest rate in 20 years. The addition to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of PrEP, a preventive medicine to ensure that HIV is not transmitted, has been credited with part of that success, building on the work which dates back to the Hawke government and all successive governments and all successive health ministers since then. I hope that the new foundation which the Prime Minister announced, the Hawke foundation, will contribute to further medical research to give young medical researchers the opportunity to further their careers and to produce breakthroughs that will help the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am somebody who has spent considerable time in the environment space, often opposite the member for Watson. We would disagree on some things but secretly conspire to achieve others. And then there were the things he talked about where I had no idea what his cunning plan was. But good on him on that! To acknowledge what happened with Bob Hawke and the environment is to acknowledge something quite profound. His contribution on Antarctica, I think, may be his most important environmental legacy. The fact is that we've been able to add to it and continue it, and we have a $2 billion program to honour that legacy of protecting Antarctica—something which no Australian government will ever walk away from, in my view. It is because, deeply embodied within the parliament, we have a shared goal of protecting Antarctica that we have a $2 billion refurbishment program for the Antarctic icebreaker. Many of us have worked in this space together. To see that continuum I think is extremely important. What was done on World Heritage, the work in relation to Uluru, Kakadu and Gondwana—all of these things are abiding and then added to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Landcare: Landcare has been an immensely important part of the fabric of the Australian landscape—literally the landscape and the people who work in the land. With my great friend Ken Wyatt, we have looked at Landcare projects and other projects over the years, and I never lost the source of that, the origin of that—the work of Phillip Toyne, Bob Hawke and others in bringing that together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on behalf of the government and on behalf of the people of Flinders, I want to acknowledge the work of Bob Hawke; his amazing life. When I met him, what struck me were his dancing, mischievous eyes that he still had in his later years and that immense love of all of the people. As long as he thought you were doing the right thing by the people, he thought you were okay. He was a great figure and he will continue to be a great figure. I want to pass on my best wishes to everybody on the other side—it is a difficult day in a difficult week—and to all of those Australians who will benefit from his abiding contribution to Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I think many of us on this side, and of course the government benches as well, have very mixed feelings about this condolence motion today. We've lost a Labor legend, an Australian icon. We have heavy hearts for that reason, but there is so much to celebrate too about the life of Bob Hawke. There were so many stories, both at his memorial service and in the media in the days after. We heard of his sad death. And today as well we have had so many insights into a life well lived by an Australian who was loved by the Australian public and who loved them in return. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've lost a friend, a mentor and a shoulder to lean on. The outpouring of grief that we saw in the days after Bob's death was really very real. It was sincerely felt across the Australian public, and I think that rawness was really salved by the wonderful memorial service that many of us attended. Blanche d'Alpuget, who was Bob's great love and carer at the end of his life, did such a marvellous job of inviting people to share their memories of Bob so that we heard from colleagues, family members and former staff. Every member of the Australian public was able to join in that celebration of that wonderful life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our condolences, of course, go to Bob's children—Sue, Ros and Stephen—who, with their much-loved mother, Hazel, had to share their father for so many years with the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob didn't mind a bit of a cry every now and again. I think he was quite different to many Australian men of his generation. He didn't try to hide his feelings and, on that day in that memorial service, there were many tears shed but there was a lot of laughter too and acknowledgement of Bob's great contribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob became Prime Minister at a time when the country was bedevilled with inflation and a moribund economy. We were a divided Australia—an Australia that was uncertain of itself and in a slow decline. It felt like the place was fizzling out. Bob was exactly the right man for that epoch. As one writer said, 'He had the smell of history about him.' He was a consummate conciliator—a man who brought avowed enemies to the negotiating table, who healed the wounds of our party and our nation. But he was much more than just a consensus politician; he was prepared to take risks—it might have been the punter in him. He was big, bold and brave. The accord, Medicare, the floating of the dollar, the deregulation of the financial system, the tearing down of tariff walls: it is a remarkable list, and so much of it was done with his great collaborator, Paul Keating.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when we talk of Bob at a time like this it is very easy to forget how hard-fought those reforms were. It is wonderful that so many of them have become popular today or just common sense or just accepted as inevitable, but the reforms were hard-fought. Bob didn't mind having those fights. Many of them, of course, were with his opponents from other political parties, but plenty of them were from our side as well. I was a university student starting university at the time when HECS was being introduced, so I can tell you there was more than one vice-chancellor's office stormed by my friends and me at that time. There were more higher education conferences protested outside of than it's perhaps wise to remember on a day like this. Those reforms were bold, and because they were bold they attracted controversy, and Bob wasn't scared of that at all. Though controversial, though difficult and though hard-fought, those reforms changed everything for our country. They opened our economy. They released the shackles from our nation. They made us more competitive, more relevant globally. They laid the foundation for decades of economic growth and they held true to Labor values: the concept of the fair go, of fundamental decency, of reaching out a helping hand to those who were most marginalised and offering them the social safety net that the member for Lingiari has spoken about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He didn't build bridges just within Australia. Allowing the 27,000 Chinese students who were living in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre to remain in Australia, again, was a difficult and controversial thing to do, but it projected our values as a nation to the globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob certainly had an antenna for talent. The depth and breadth of talent assembled in his cabinet was astonishing, with the likes of Paul Keating, Gareth Evans, Kim Beazley, Brian Howe, Susan Ryan, Neal Blewett, Barry Jones and John Button. There were so many talented people in those cabinets who really worked together to challenge, to debate, to argue and then to agree and make our country better. He harnessed their gifts and brought out the best in them. Under his leadership they changed Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Watson, I caught up with Bob quite a lot in the later years of his life. We talked a lot about the achievements of his government, but he didn't feel a need to relive his successes. He was very comfortable with his legacy. He was proud of his legacy, but he didn't feel the need to remind people of it constantly. He didn't have things to prove or scores to settle. He wasn't rewriting history in the later years of his life. He was happy to reflect on those times and the way he'd achieved the great successes of those battles, but he was also very focused on the future. We will remember those achievements for him. As Blanche—his beloved Blanche—said at his memorial service, one of the achievements that Bob was proudest of was taking our high school graduation rates from three in 10 young Australians graduating from high school to seven in 10 during the relatively few short years of his government. He knew the importance of lifelong education. He knew that it had and has the ability to transform the life of an individual—to give them opportunities that their parents and grandparents never dreamed of. He knew that education could set someone on a course, as his education did, to shaping the nation. But he also knew the importance of investment in education as a driver of economic success for this nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see the difference that that investment in education during the Hawke-Keating years has made to our economic opportunities as a nation today. As I said earlier, as a uni student, in the early years of the HECS generations, I was doing my fair share of protesting. But what the Higher Education Contribution Scheme did was allow the opening up of attendance at university to many, many more Australians. Having the contribution scheme meant that we could increase attendance at university in a way that would otherwise have been unaffordable. Thousands of additional students were given the opportunity of an education. Just as people say that when you look at the Medicare card in your wallet you should remember the legacy of Bob Hawke, I think it's fair to say, particularly if you're from a working class family and you look at your university degree on the wall—if you've gotten around to framing it; most of us probably haven't—that you have to remember that that, too, is a legacy of the Hawke government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was up-front about his flaws, and I think it was beautiful the way that many of the speakers at his memorial service didn't pretend that Bob was perfect. He wouldn't have wanted them to pretend that he was perfect. I think that's what, as he said himself, people responded to: the humanity that he was prepared to share with the Australian people—his struggles as well as his successes. He was an extrovert's extrovert. He could charm the birds from the trees. His personality, both the flaws and that real charm, helped deliver four election victories in a row. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, we asked Bob Hawke to come to Canberra and speak to our caucus and staff at a dinner as a special surprise guest. I had very, very strict instructions from his wonderful, loyal, long-serving, beautiful and dedicated PA, Jill Saunders, that I was not allowed to let a million people get their photos with Bob, because he was getting older and he was getting tired and everybody would want a photo with him, and it was after dinner and it was going to be too exhausting. So there I was on duty, trying to stop people mobbing our great hero, while Bob was behind me calling them in: 'Come on! No worries, let's get a photo together!' Jill had given me instructions that I was to have him home early and it was my job to make sure he got out of there in good time. I was exhausted, leaning on the table and thinking, 'When is this going to finish?' and he was singing happy birthday to one of the people working at the Press Club. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a man who got so much strength from talking to people. Of course, it was a little bit about the adoration, because who doesn't love being adored? But it was much more than that. It was actually about hearing about their lives, their struggles today, their successes, their families, their work. He got so much back from his interaction with people—with his old friends, former staff who he always stayed in contact with, and also the new people that he met wherever he went. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes Bob and I would have lunch at one of his favourite Italian restaurants in Darlinghurst, and I had lots of questions about some of the battles of the past and some of the successes. But he was very keen to talk about the politics of the day and very keen, always, to think about the future. He wasn't someone who was just dwelling on the past and reliving his great victories. He profoundly cared about the modern Labor Party. I know he was very supportive of many of my colleagues who are here today. He profoundly cared about our electoral prospects, our policies and our potential successes. He was focused, laser-like, on the future. I thought it was beautiful to hear his granddaughter Sophie talking at his memorial service about the many years of environmental activism and real achievement that the member for Watson and others have detailed. Bob was still talking about climate change. He'd talked about it decades before most people. He was still talking about climate change and global warming even very recently when I'd seen him. Sophie was talking about this, too: his commitment to seeing real action on climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Bob and Blanche loved Lord Howe Island, which is in my electorate. I saw them there. The Prime Minister was talking about Bob answering the door in the nude, and Gareth Evans has talked about that in his books. I'm very happy to report that he was wearing bathers on Lord Howe Island! He did love the natural environment there, the fishing and the world heritage protection that had been achieved for Lord Howe Island too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People see Bob as very blokey and beer-drinking. They see the larrikin elements of him. But what I saw in our conversations was the phenomenally sharp intellect, his capacity to recall detail, his resolve, his indefatigability and his compassion for people. I think that face of his—the laughing eyes, as the health minister was talking about, with lines etched into his face from a lifetime of warmth and wisdom—is something that Australians will always remember.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was always prepared to campaign for our Labor cause. In 2016, when he saw Medicare under threat, he was prepared to don the battle gear again and travel around Australia. I travelled with him to many functions—speeches, press conferences, visits—where he was speaking of Medicare and the great legacy that he was so proud of. Michael Lee told me that he was happy to campaign in the City of Sydney Council elections when Michael Lee was running for Lord Mayor many years ago. He was always prepared to turn up to back the Labor Party and Labor Party candidates. We all remember him singing at the top of his voice 'Waltzing Matilda' and 'Solidarity Forever'. But we also remember the man who was so gentle and tender, visiting Hazel in her last days and holding her hand and softly singing 'Danny Boy' to her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was absolutely larger than life. I remember, at the City of Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks one year, Bob and Blanche turning up all in white on a launch, landing on the steps of the Opera House and coming in to the fireworks. He loved a grand entrance. I think that in many ways he would be very touched by his exit as well—the outpouring of feeling for him from our nation. I went to see him for the last time at home just before the election campaign got into full swing. He was tired. As the member for Watson said, he was very tired. But he was still full of insight into the current campaign and the political issues that we face today. He was full of encouragement. I can't really describe how very encouraging he was of me personally, how generous he was with his time. The feeling that he always gave me—I was much younger; I'm a woman; he was a man; all that—is that I always felt like he treated me as a comrade. That meant so much to me, to be treated as a comrade by such a great man. I'm sure many of my colleagues share this feeling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by saying this: Kim Beazley has spoken about Clem Hawke more than once and the influence that Clem had on Bob. Clem used to say, 'If you are a believer in the fatherhood of God, you must believe in the brotherhood of man.' You absolutely saw that with Bob. He didn't have that sort of faith later in his life, but the relationships he had, including with people like Nelson Mandela, show how intensely he believed in the brotherhood of man.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3A" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Australians</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I also rise to speak on the condolence motion for Robert James Lee Hawke. There are visual images you retain of individuals in circumstances throughout your life. They're tangible because they bring out the essence of the individual. My first father-in-law and I used to often debate about Bob Hawke and his role in the ACTU and being a strikebreaker. We'd have great discussions about the quality of the man, his capacity to bring together warring factions and bring them to a point where he would get agreement. I thought that was remarkable given many of the industrial challenges that prevailed in that period in Australia. Even greater is the legacy of the markers that he leaves, in the reforms that he created for this country out of his driven element of humanity, and the way in which he wanted to bring about changes that had a focus on equity for all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hadn't met Bob Hawke until I was attending a meeting at Old Parliament House. There were a group of us from the National Aboriginal Education Committee standing on the steps, waiting to head up and register to go and see the Hon. Susan Ryan, Minister for Education at the time. We saw a Comcar pull up with a flag on it. Somebody in the group said, 'That must be the Prime Minister.' Bob Hawke got out of the vehicle, started to walk up the steps, saw us, turned and came over. He stood and said, 'Where are you from?' The eight of us had a conversation. As we all know, when we're in these jobs our advisers try to hurry us on for the next appointment. But what struck me was he said, 'They can wait.' He stood and talked with us for 15 minutes about some of the issues that we saw as being important for the education of Indigenous kids and pathways to better opportunities and he shared with us his thoughts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned, at the time, that health was another one. He said to me, 'You need to meet with Richo.' I asked about the good senator, and he said, 'He's a good man; you'll get an opportunity to meet with him.' But I was a public servant and there are protocols for public servants to meet with federal ministers when you're from a state jurisdiction. I got that chance with Richo much later, on a national body. I recalled the Prime Minister's words and raised an issue with Richo. I angered him immensely. I'll share that story one day. When you incur the wrath of Richo you certainly feel the heat. But he was one of the incredible team the Prime Minister had in leading this nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That meeting resulted in me meeting Hazel Hawke, at a later point. What I liked about Hazel was that she was a Western Australian; she was a Perth girl. From my perspective, Bob had married into the right pedigree. I got to know Hazel very briefly, but what I found with Hazel was the same as I found with Bob: the compassion that both of them had for social issues, and particularly their commitment to Indigenous Australians. And I saw that in their son Stephen, who I met later in the Kimberley, and in the work he was doing. But he left an indelible impression from that meeting. What I saw was somebody who was prepared to take time from a very busy schedule to talk with us, to listen and to look us in the eye. I never saw him once look over our shoulders to see if there was anybody else around, and that's a great marker of the integrity of people who seriously want to engage on a very challenging issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, when the Australian parliament moved into this building, I recall that, on the very first sitting day here in this chamber, he made his first item of business a resolution acknowledging the prior occupation of land by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. And, when you think of that period, that was substantial. When you think of the time in which he made that statement about people and acknowledging their dispossession and the denial of their citizenship rights, that was a momentous moment that was captured in time, because we'd not had that acknowledged in that manner in a chamber at the national level. I saw that as typical Hawke: his vision, his commitment and his propensity to acknowledge the wrongs and to work to right them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His legacy in many issues will be left for a long time. I remember sitting with my first wife, because she worked in a library, and they'd just brought in copies of the decisions around Kakadu and the books that were associated with them. I was flicking through them. I said, 'When are these going on the public shelf?' And she said, 'They've got to be processed and labelled and a session process occur.' And I said, 'Who did this?' And she said, 'The Prime Minister.' Now, that Kakadu decision was momentous because it changed the way in which a piece of significant Aboriginal land that was sacred to a nation of people was going to be protected. It was important because it is still pristine today; it remains as a significant area that Australians can celebrate. I know that he would not have had an easy journey in taking that through cabinet, because he would have had to argue with other colleagues who saw capacity for it to be used in different ways, but he nevertheless did it. He understood that the new parliament also sat on ancient land, and that also shaped his thinking. He also understood that change begins with recognition and respect, and he manifested that—and that carried through to Paul Keating. Paul Keating's Redfern speech was a landmark speech. And while at the time those two finished their careers and their successful achievements together on an acrimonious note, the legacy that Bob left with Paul was manifested in that speech. Galarrwuy Yunupingu said that Hawke's efforts to bridge the gap back between black and white Australia were always sincere, and that sincerity prevailed throughout all the time that I watched him do the work that impacted across many areas. Others have remarked on how Hawke always acted in good faith, and what we do is develop relationships based on trust, faith and integrity. I have to acknowledge that I enjoyed that privilege with your former leader. He demonstrated that time and time again on many issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He sat down together with First Nations people at Barunga in the Northern Territory. Images appeared on television of him sitting on the red Australian earth, surrounded by gum trees and the sky. When he received the Barunga Statement, that visually sent a very strong message around the nation: that he accepted the principles that were being explained in that statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He established ATSIC. ATSIC was a significant structure for Indigenous Australians. It provided the opportunity for people at the community level to influence the thinking on directions taken and on policies that needed to be established to make a difference in the lives of our children and future generations—how you engaged with them and how you were involved in trying to shape a future that would make a difference for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation—the appointment of Senator Pat Dodson there, the work they did and their engagement over a period of time—and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody changed the way in which all tiers of government responded to policy. The benefits gained over that period of time have been the backbone and foundation for the policies that we now have in place and the reforms that have occurred. There is still much to do, but he invested in Indigenous education with AbSec, Abstudy—tertiary qualifications being a major driver of his own vision—and job opportunities. He never gave up on those or the traineeships, which prevailed as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the deaths in custody, he handed back ownership of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park to its traditional owners. One thinks of Uluru as being a spiritual hub and a significant area of sacredness. He went against the advice that was given by national parks to prevail with the status quo, and so it made a difference. It resulted in other handbacks over a period of time. The IBA, the ILC and some of the land issues emanated from a bold move that he took. I do get what all of you on the other side have said about his strength of leadership, because he toughed it out at times. He was prepared to be different. He was prepared to stand with people in our community, to walk with them and to effect change. At the time of the handing back, hundreds of people, both Indigenous and non-indigenous, attended the ceremony when Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen handed over the deeds to the Anangu.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke went on to fight for us, sometimes with full and blistering force. Sometimes he had to capitulate, because the other issue that he faced was the pragmatic reality that the forces that you have to take on in order to effect change are very different to the conservative period in our time. But, nevertheless, he was persistent at all times. On the issue of mining at Coronation Hill in Kakadu, I know that he fought bitterly against some of his cabinet colleagues, because he saw and recognised the importance of country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He respected the Jawoyn people. The proposed mine was in sickness country, where the serpent god, Bolung, lived underground. They believed that mining would disturb Bolung, and this would have dire consequences for them. In Hawke's words, he did not pretend to comprehend or to share the Jawoyn beliefs but he did understand and respect their identification with the land, with their gods and with the earth. Again, having that belief was forward-thinking for the time in which he was leader of this nation. He told his colleagues that dismissing these beliefs as fallacious and mythological amounted to discrimination. If there was one thing that Bob Hawke couldn't stand for, it was racism, and I heard him express that view on several occasions. As was referred to by colleagues on the other side, in his mind, the Jawoyn's beliefs were no less legitimate than those held sincerely by Christians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He formed this view after having sat down with the Jawoyn and listening to them. This simple act of listening to people, sitting around in the dust or in a boardroom, was powerful. This is something that still resonates strongly with me today: a leader of a nation, who is prepared to sit and listen not only with his ears but with his eyes. I noticed a couple of times he would react to somebody who showed a facial expression that indicated that they weren't happy. He would stop and say, 'What is it that you want to say?' Sometimes in our roles we don't listen enough, but certainly Bob Hawke did. That simple act also meant sometimes there were disappointments because he would have to say no. He would have to say: 'It's not feasible; I can't win it, but I'll have a go.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawke himself said that one of the great regrets he had as Prime Minister was that he wasn't able to do more for Aboriginal people. He said, 'There is still much to be done across so many areas.' There were unrealised hopes and dreams, but Bob Hawke changed that conversation. By the time Bob left the prime minister's office, it could be said that Australians had a much better understanding of the need to sit down with First Nations people, to acknowledge past wrongs, and to get on and deal with the injustices. He opened the opportunity for a dialogue that has grown extensively, and subsequent prime ministers have continued what Bob left as a legacy. His final act as Prime Minister was to hand over the painted Barunga Statement to the custody of this parliament for permanent display. The handover took place in an emotional ceremony. Today, the statement hangs near the Members' Hall, where we can pass it on our way to the main committee room. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was a man who held the needs of Indigenous Australians dear to his heart, and he wanted Australians to hold them dear to theirs as well. When I reflect on Bob Hawke the person, I respect his regard for all Australians but in particular Indigenous Australians. His zest for a full life and his leadership of a nation is a legacy that I know he was proud of but that, equally, those of his family can cherish. He was never afraid of a challenge and always stood by a sense of a just and equal society. Anna and I would like to provide our condolences to Bob's children, Susan, Stephen, Robert and Rosslyn. His late ex-wife Hazel had raised his family with all the demands of Bob being ACTU leader, and later Prime Minister, and served ably as the first woman of Australia. I also offer my heartfelt sympathies to Blanche d'Alpuget. I hope the kind words this place offers today provide her comfort in what I'm sure is still a difficult time. Bob Hawke, thank you for what you did for our nation, but in particular for First Nations people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWK" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  It's a great privilege to follow the Minister for Indigenous Australians. I want to thank him for his contribution to this condolence motion. I want to thank the government for agreeing to set aside today's proceedings to honour Bob Hawke, and for the energy and the effort that so many government members have taken to prepare speeches and for the generous content of those speeches in tribute to a man who was not of their political party but who I think all recognise made a great contribution to this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up, as so many in this chamber did, in a deeply political household that, in my case, was fiercely Labor. Although I had an 'It's time' badge pinned to my clothes when I was a toddler, the 1983 election is the first election at a federal level that I remember clearly. My mum had taken leave from her job to work in Labor Party headquarters, as she did for all of Hawke's elections through that period. I assume my mother was at an election party far more enjoyable than mine six weeks ago, but my brother and I spent the evening of election night in 1983 at my great-uncle's house—my great-uncle on my father's side. My father's side has a proud but very misdirected Tory legacy in their family, and my great-uncle, who was a dear, dear man, unfortunately was a terrible Tory. I can still remember to this day the scowl on his face as he looked at me clapping when Bob Hawke walked into the tally room on that evening. I'm not sure I really understood why I was clapping, except that I knew that's what my mum wanted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right through my adolescence, Bob Hawke was Australia's Prime Minister. The first federal election I was entitled to vote at, I got to vote for Bob Hawke. So it's perhaps hard to be entirely objective about a man who was such a giant in those formative years of my life. But on any objective measure, at a far more mature age than I was when I first voted, I'm very clear in my mind that Bob Hawke was Australia's greatest Prime Minister. There is room for reasonable people to disagree about these things. As the Prime Minister quite reasonably said, the test that John Curtin was subject to during World War II was something that, thankfully, none of us have ever known and hopefully will never know. But Hawke, I think, on any objective test, deserves the title of Australia's greatest Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His time as Prime Minister was located in the middle of a period of relatively strong and stable leadership for almost four decades from Whitlam to Howard, a period that we've not known in this place for more than a decade. But the remarkable thing among those five prime ministers, Whitlam to Howard, is how quickly Hawke got the job, because all four of those other prime ministers—Whitlam, Fraser, Keating and Howard—had served at least 20 years as parliamentarians before they became Prime Minister. Bob Hawke had just served three and, as the Prime Minister said earlier today—I didn't know this statistic myself—only 36 days as Leader of the Opposition. Truly blessed. The speed with which he came up to the toughest job in the nation was just extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He excelled immediately and right through the course of his prime ministership in all the major areas of public policy as we understand them. On the international stage, as many on my side of the chamber and the other side have said, he was confident, he was hardworking, he was progressive and he always projected an independent Australian national interest on that international stage. On economic policy, he's universally and justifiably recognised as the Prime Minister who oversaw the modernisation of the Australian economy, with a brilliant Treasurer in Paul Keating and a wonderful cabinet as well, setting us up for the 20 years of uninterrupted economic growth that has lifted Australia's prosperity to such a degree over the last almost three decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he was not presiding over the only economy in the Western world that was undergoing the pressures of the 1980s that Australia was confronting, and his response—or his government's response—to that was something that I think deserves some attention, because this was the era of Reaganomics. It was the era of Thatcher's radicalism, and there was an alternative path to the path that Hawke and Keating steered Australia through. It was that path of Reaganomics and Thatcher's radicalism. Instead, Hawke's modernisation of the Australian economy was uniquely and quintessentially Labor. He worked with those workers and those communities in Australia that were being impacted by the pain of unavoidable economic restructuring, because the truth is that, over the sweep of our history, Australia has generally been particularly poor at structural adjustment. We've generally expected communities just to suck it up. I've seen that in my own community over the last five years as Australia's car manufacturing industry has shut down. Structural adjustment programs have really just extended to helping workers dust off their CVs and perhaps do some job interview training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawke, Keating and John Button's approach was quintessentially different. It worked with workers and their unions. It worked with local communities and came up with deep, meaningful structural adjustment programs that we've seen only too rarely here in Australia—the car plan, the steel plan, the really deliberative approach to waterfront industry reform that was extraordinarily hard but worked with unions and industry and local government authorities to make sure that, as far as possible, it spread the pain of that unavoidable economic restructuring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, and as has been said so many times already over the last few hours, his social reforms, as well as his economic reforms, still sit right at the heart of Australian society today. They are enduring. They are now an unstitchable part of the fabric of Australian society—Medicare, lifting the high school retention rate from 30 to 70 per cent, making meaningful those higher education reforms that Whitlam had started a decade and a half earlier, universal superannuation. Expanding childcare, I think, was one of the jewels in the crown of Australia's social reforms during that period because it made practically meaningful the ability, particularly of working mothers, to combine work with family responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the final area of policy I want to address is the environment. There's already been a number of speakers who have addressed this, particularly the member for Watson, who has had a lifelong devotion to environmental policy. Hawke's granddaughter Sophie told the story at Hawke's memorial service—and the member for Watson has relayed it as well—about protecting Antarctica. That alone, if it were his only environmental protection achievement, in itself, would be a giant legacy. But there is so much else besides that—the Tasmanian wilderness, the Daintree and visionary programs like Landcare that have already been talked about. Without question, Hawke is the greatest Prime Minister that Australia's natural environment has ever had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to address the question of climate change as well, because at Hawke's memorial Sophie also said that, in the past several months, Hawke had expressed great sadness that Australia had failed to act on climate change and that he saw it as a collective failure of our nation that we'd traded short-term interests over intergenerational equity. In the 1980s, barely a decade after the term 'global warming' first appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Science</span> magazine, Hawke created the Commission for the Future. Some of its earliest work was the greenhouse project to examine climate change—its causes and effects and the methods to manage the problem. Before 1987 or 1988, there had barely been a public mention of climate change beyond scientific journals, particularly until the testimony of NASA scientist James Hansen to Congress in the US in the late 1980s. This was part of what I think was a golden area of global climate change cooperation, when no politician suggested that the scientific community was engaged in conspiracy or suggested that the current generation's economic interests should take priority over longer-term considerations, including the economic interests of future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1988, the Toronto conference bought together politicians, scientists and economists from several dozen countries and called upon the developed nations of the world to stabilise carbon emissions at 1988 levels by 2000 and to cut them by 20 per cent by 2005. Hawke was a key supporter of this effort. He spoke passionately on the television in 1989 alongside his then 4-year-old granddaughter, Sophie, imploring Australia to think of the long term. He was very clear on the potential of climate change to disrupt Australian life. As he put it: 'The greenhouse effect'—as we called it back then, and now call global warming—'cannot be dismissed as just another environmental problem. It has the potential to change fundamentally, within a single lifetime, the way all nations and people live and work.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawke fought the 1990 election campaign largely on environmental issues, including the Coronation Hill goldminers, as we've heard already a number of times this morning, as well as a commitment that a re-elected government would adopt the Toronto position as an interim target—Australia's first emissions reduction target. It is worth noting that this was a bipartisan position adopted by Andrew Peacock, the then Liberal leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Hawke years ended, and the recession of the early1990s took hold, the golden era of climate consensus, very short as it was, drew to an end. Powerful lobby groups and companies targeted the science in a manner not seen against any other scientific consensus in the modern era. The powerful tools of self-interest, economic doomsaying and fear took hold in the political sphere, and the landscape was slowly infected with toxic sludge, tearing at the groundwork that Hawke had worked so hard to lay for climate action. To honour Bob, we should continue the work that he began, because Bob knew that we only borrow the planet; we borrow it from our kids, from their kids and so on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first met Bob almost 20 years ago on an evening as part of the election review after the 2001 <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> election loss, as it was called then, that he and Neville Wran conducted along with Tim Gartrell. We had a party members' forum in South Australia. As I recall it, I was blamed for pretty much all of the party's ills at the time! It was a meeting that was obviously stacked with my factional enemies! After that, the four of us enjoyed a dinner over several hours and several bottles of wine. Tim and I, pretty young at the time and straitlaced individuals, were exposed to all of the colour of Labor's history over recent decades—the terrible conferences and so on and so forth—through Bob and Neville, two giants of the Labor movement. We bonded over a common knowledge of Ray Gietzelt, who was the legendary general secretary of the union that I was the secretary of at the time, the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia. Ray had been general secretary of the union for decades, and was really the driving force that got the numbers for Bob to become the ACTU president in the late sixties. There was also their love of Lionel Murphy, who was Ray's best friend and a great friend also of Bob and Neville. That set the tone, I think, for a relationship that all of us enjoyed on this side of the House, no matter how young, junior and relatively insignificant we were in the Labor movement. Bob always treated us as equals, and was always incredibly generous with his time to encourage, to advise and to press us to be more ambitious, more progressive and more brave. He really was the most generous Labor figure of his time in terms of devotion to continual campaigning for Labor and the mentoring of younger Labor people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I last saw him at his home over summer, enjoying a couple of hours with him, Blanche and Sue Pieters-Hawke, his daughter and a great friend of mine who I've worked closely with, particularly around dementia, as well as his dear friend and former advisor Craig Emerson. As the member for Watson remarked, at some point during that afternoon we were sharing a cigar with his daughter Sue and Bob put his hand on my forearm and just said, apropos of nothing at the time, 'Paul and I have made up.' It was clearly a wonderful thing for him personally, and, as I remarked to him at the time, such an important thing for our party. It was so important that he and Paul had broken bread and the most important partnership of modern Labor had found a way back together before Bob had passed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to send my condolence to Blanche and his family, Sue, Stephen and Rosslyn and his granddaughters, but also to his friends. I particularly want to mention Craig Emerson, who I know was such a dear friend to Bob for so many years and who gave so much of his time in Bob's later months to ensure that Bob's family was supported—that Bob and Blanche, personally, were supported—and also so that Bob was able to connect with so many members of the Labor Party in his final months. Today we farewell a genuinely exceptional Australian.</span>

                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise to contribute to this condolence motion in relation to the late Bob Hawke. The memorial service at the Sydney Opera House was a remarkable event, and it was a great privilege to be able to attend it. The array of people who were assembled there from so many walks of life was powerful evidence of Hawke's extraordinary impact on our nation. Listening to Paul Keating, Ross Garnaut, Bill Kelty, Kim Beazley and Craig Emerson, amongst others, was in some ways like attending a seminar on the 1980s economic reform process. To touch on why I found that significant, I want to refer to something that I said in my first speech in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unusually for a student politician, I also went to lectures. Studying economics in the mid-eighties, my political views were further developed. I saw that Australia had an outdated economic model, with rigid labour markets, high tariff walls and heavy government ownership and control of many areas of the economy. But I also learned about the changes being made—floating the dollar, opening up the banking sector to foreign competitors and reducing tariffs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, in my first speech in this place I chose not to emphasise that those reforms were led by Bob Hawke. But today, as I rise to join other parliamentarians to pay tribute to Bob Hawke, it is absolutely the central point that must be emphasised. While reflecting on being thrust back in memory to the 1980s, I should add a personal reflection, which I think is somewhat appropriate, that at the time I lived in a student share house in Glebe. We had in that house a very useful household item, which was then quite widely available in the shops. It was a hollow plastic bust of Bob Hawke with a screw top, a wine tap at the bottom and a large printed label, 'take the piss out of Bob'. In our student household we did that frequently, pouring in the contents of the those four-litre wine casks which were a common feature of student consumption in the 1980s and may well still be so today. I think, by the way, that that is an indicator of Bob Hawke's place in Australian popular culture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to make three points in my brief contribution today. Over his term as Prime Minister Bob Hawke led an economic reform process that was vitally important to Australia. A critical way that he did that was by working with other Australians. The impact of that was felt right across our economy, as many other speakers have observed. I want to touch briefly on the impact he had on the telecommunications sector. The reform process that Bob Hawke led was quite remarkable, and the list of reforms is an extraordinarily long one: floating the dollar; opening up the banking sector to allow the entry of foreign banks; deregulating interest rates; a range of tax reforms, including the introduction of the capital gains tax; opening up a whole series of markets to competition in transport, banking, telecommunications and other markets; privatising, in whole or in part, government business enterprises like Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Many of these have gone on to become highly successful, wealth-generating companies, expanding their operations around the world. There was the introduction of HECS and, of course, the tariff reform and reduction process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In retrospect, when we touch on it and when it's described, it all seems and looks so smooth and easy. But of course it was a highly challenging process and required great political skill. Hawke was prepared to take on some very tough fights as part of the reform process. Not every one of them was successful, like the attempted introduction of a national identity card, the Australia Card, in the late 1980s, or the attempt to introduce a consumption tax as part of the 1985 tax reform process—the famous 'option C', which was abandoned when Hawke got off the cart. I say this not to be critical at all but to make the observation that, to achieve the extraordinary range of reforms that he did, he had to be prepared to take on a great many issues. While he had success on many if not most of them, he didn't have success on all of them. But he would not have achieved the success that he did on those where reform was achieved had he not been prepared to take on those, including the few, where success was not achieved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of Hawke's great strengths, which I would argue that he deployed to its greatest effect in his time as Prime Minister and which was a feature of his career, was his ability to work with others. Of course, he had extraordinary intellectual capacities and he had the benefit of a tertiary education of great breadth both in Australia and internationally. His knowledge about industrial and economic policy was very deep at a time when tertiary education was not as common and widely available as it is today. But as well as his deep subject matter expertise, what he also had was enormous interpersonal skills and a great capacity to persuade others to follow the course that he advocated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He came into this place with an incredibly rich set of personal connections. He had worked for decades at the very apex of the industrial relations establishment. He had very strong networks, not just amongst union leaders but amongst business leaders. His use of national summits as a way to build support for reforms was masterful. I do want to acknowledge his readiness to work with political opponents to achieve policy ends. As many speakers from this side of the House have observed, a number of his achievements as Prime Minister depended upon, or were facilitated by, his readiness to work with this side of the chamber to achieve his policy ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of his other very significant achievements was working with Nick Greiner, the then Premier of New South Wales, in relation to National Competition Policy. One of the realities of Australian politics and policy is that if you want to achieve outcomes as a federal government then you need to be ready to work constructively with state governments. Certainly, when it comes to National Competition Policy, that partnership between Hawke and Greiner was enormously important in achieving a series of reforms that were given effect to at both federal and state government levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me finally touch briefly on the impact that Hawke had on the telecommunications sector. Others have spoken about his impact on a whole range of sectors. Certainly, his impact on the telecommunications sector was profound and long lasting. I think Australians today take it for granted that we have a telecommunications industry which is vigorously competitive and where there is relentless technological innovation. We now see the mobile operators introducing 5G networks, and we see the NBN rollout of fixed broadband approaching competition. When Hawke came to power in 1983, it was very different. There were two government-owned monopolies, Telecom Australia and OTC, and they had firm control of all aspects of telecommunications services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a series of significant reforms under the Hawke government. The first geostationary communication satellite was launched by AUSSAT in 1985, although I would make the point that AUSSAT was established in 1981 under the Fraser government. The reform progress continued. There was a considerable reform of the market structure. There was a new Telecommunications Act passed in 1989. This was followed by an even more significant reform, which was unveiled in 1990. Kim Beazley, as the then minister, brought forward a proposal to combine Telecom Australia and OTC; to issue a second fixed telecommunications licence; to issue—almost as an afterthought at the time—three mobile licences to use this newfangled technology called GSM; and to lay the groundwork for the full deregulation of telecommunications in a few years subsequently. After 1996, when the Howard government came to power, that deregulation process was continued with the Telecommunications Act 1997. The features of the telecommunications sector that we take for granted today are, in many ways, a reflection of policy decisions taken under Bob Hawke's leadership. That really is one of many sectors where his leadership has had profound and lasting impacts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Others can speak of their personal experience of Bob Hawke. From a different side of politics and from a different generation, I never met him, although, like all Australians, I feel that I know him. Also, like all Australians, I have benefited from the remarkable program of economic reform that he led. I express my condolences to Bob Hawke's family. I say thank you, Bob Hawke, for your service to Australia.</span>

                  <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  The sad irony of condolence motions is that you wish the clocks could somehow be turned back so that the subject about whom you speak can hear the words that are actually said. That's certainly the case today for the fine tributes we've already heard, and it was certainly the case at that generous, affectionate, pitch-perfect celebration of Bob Hawke's life at the Opera House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many members in this place, when I brave the crisp Canberra morning for a jog through the parliamentary triangle I pass the statues of three great Australian prime ministers. My running pace, I'm pleased to say, allows me the time to study the detail of the sculptor. On the path between those old boarding houses at Barton and the chamber down the hill, Ben Chifley and John Curtin walk side by side. It's a beautiful pair of statues. It captures the quiet moment ahead of another busy day—two old friends sharing a laugh; two giants who shared the burden of winning a war, securing a peace and building a home fit for the heroes who returned. Further down the road on the shores of the lake he saw come to life, Robert Menzies walks alone. There's a winning smile on his face—the expression of a man accustomed to success, confident that it will last. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was back on his 87th birthday that I asked Bob, and his beloved Blanche and his children and a crowd of wellwishers, how we could capture Bob's likeness in a statue. Maybe it could be with a microphone or a megaphone in one hand and the other moving in time with the words, rallying, inspiring and delighting his audience. Maybe it could be with his head cocked, one hand grasping his earlobe, listening respectfully to an Aboriginal elder, a captain of industry, an American president or a local parent out doing the shopping. Maybe it could be in the stands of our racecourses, with creased and folded form guide in hand, ticking off another winner. Or maybe it could be in 'that' jacket, mouth open, roaring with laughter, wearing the champagne, giving his prime ministerial blessing to a national sickie! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very quickly, on Bob's 87th, we came to the conclusion that, whatever the pose the sculptor opted for, the statue could never be tucked away in some quiet corner of our bush capital. It would have to be out amongst the Australian people, the people who loved Bob because they could tell Bob loved them, the people whose innate wisdom Bob trusted and whose support secured, more often than any other Labor member, that of the people. In reality, no matter the final location, no matter how lifelike the bronze or how skilled the hands that shape it, no artist will ever be able to surpass the monuments that Bob and his government already built larger than lifetimes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many of those achievements, the product of fierce debate and hard decisions, have earned the ultimate compliment from Bob's political opponents. They now gently reweave and rewrite history to pretend that they supported them all along. This brings me to that magic Hawke word that's frequently invoked and less well understood. The word is 'consensus'. Consensus is what attracted me to join the Labor Party. Consensus is what Hawke and Keating and Kelty, and those marvellous Labor leaders of that generation, delivered. Whether it's protecting our environment, standing up to racism or progressing economic reform, looking outwards to the world, consensus was never the low-rent, low-risk pursuit of the lowest common denominator. It wasn't about agreement above all else—a communique without content. It wasn't about compromise at any cost. Bringing our nation together did not mean presenting people with a set of soft options or leading our people down the lazy path of least resistance. Bob and the brilliant cabinet that he chaired so assuredly, so generously to his colleagues to include their talents, didn't demand consensus or capitulate to it. They built it through leadership, through persuasion, through what Paul Keating in his wonderful tribute described as their shared obsession with a more clever and creative Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's true that Bob had a genuine and unique connection with the Australian people. He nurtured that and treasured it. But he also deployed this connection of his in the service of something bigger, in the service of our country. Bob understood that political capital was destined to depreciate, no matter what. He understood that the true test of a leader's qualities and a political party's worth are whether they choose to invest that capital in national progress. Bob has left us unfinished business, too: treaty, climate change, a more independent foreign policy, better Medicare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were young we were warned not to meet our heroes because we were told that they are destined to disappoint. Like so many in the opposition ranks, it's amongst the great privileges of my life that not only did I get to meet my hero but I had the honour of knowing him as a friend and learning from him as a mentor. I never lost that sense of wonder that comes from turning to your hero for advice though, just as I could tell that Bob never tired of his deep interest in national political debate, his deep affection for the trade union movement, his profound belief in the Labor Party and its values and his boundless love for the Australian people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I last saw Bob just days before he passed away. He was sitting out on his beloved balcony. He had a crossword in front of him. There was a dictionary, a strawberry milkshake and a cigar, which was removed for the photo. The sun was on his face. He was at ease with himself. I understood that this visit was most likely goodbye, although he had a sturdy constitution, because I had visited him twice before in previous months thinking that that too, perhaps, would be when I last saw him. I tried to tell him what he meant to me and what he meant to all of us. I'm not sure that I found the right words for the weight of the moment. Yet still I think Bob knew. He wanted to talk about everything else, not himself. But he knew what he meant to Australia. He knew what he had achieved for our country. He knew that he was loved by his family, by his friends, by his former colleagues, by the people, right to the end. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Bob's family: the families of those who have served as leader will know what you've been through, but many others can't. I mean no malice by that. What you have endured and given very few will understand, but please be assured that many can appreciate that sacrifice for public service. Chloe has asked me to place on record her and her family's gratitude to Hazel, Blanche, to Sue, to Ros, to Stephen, to Sophie, to Rupert, Ben, David, Paul and Gabi and to their beautiful children Evie and Bronte, Kel and Sam, and Louis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will miss you, Bob. We will carry up your unfinished business. We will recall your lessons but we understand that there will never, ever again be another Bob Hawke. You were one and you were unique. From all of us in the future who receive the benefits of you and your government and your passions: we are grateful. May you rest in peace. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  As Minister for the Environment, I express my deep respect and my gratitude for the legacy of the late Robert James Lee Hawke. He cared for Australians, he cared for the environment we all share and his passion for both would be felt across continents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In protecting environmental landmarks, Bob Hawke made his own political and social landmarks: the Franklin Dam, the protection of World Heritage areas from our northern tropics to Central Australia and his outstanding international role in the protection of Antarctica for future generations. This was remarkable leadership that has stood the test of time, and these are decisions that members of this House continue to recognise and respect. Bob Hawke wasn't the first politician to care for the environment, but he was the first to bring it to the very centre of our national discussion. For the many divergent views that we may at times have now on how best to protect our environment and our place within it, there is no dispute about its priority within the political and social debate, and that is in many ways Bob Hawke's legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under his leadership, Australia added to or extended the boundaries of six properties on the World Heritage List, including the Daintree wet tropics in Queensland, Uluru national park, the rainforests of Gondwana and Western Australia's Shark Bay. Of course, nobody could fail to mention the protection of the Franklin River and the Tasmanian Wilderness Heritage area. This was a defining moment in Australia, one that would engage the whole community in a national debate and one that would lead to a fundamental change in our national approach to protecting the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate about the Franklin was about more than the traditional Left versus Right political ground game. It captured something bigger, something outside ourselves. It raised our consciousness of the natural world and demanded that we listen. As a young person whose family could see the good from both sides of politics, I certainly was part of the crowd singing 'Let the Franklin Flow' as loudly as anyone when Goanna belted out their 1983 signature anthem at Canberra's live music venues. I was far from alone, and so many other Australians can today trace their first active support for the environment back to this moment and this cause. It would lead to the passing of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 under the Hawke government and to a High Court ruling which would confirm the Commonwealth's right to protect our World Heritage areas and make laws to protect the environment. Environmental debates continue today as we strive to balance our modern way of living with the protection of our natural surroundings, but the parameters of those debates have changed forever. The concept of damming the Franklin today would be unthinkable for all sides of politics, and that, again, is a measure of Bob Hawke's legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later this week the World Heritage Committee will meet in Azerbaijan to consider a historic listing of the Budj Bim Cultural Landscape of south-western Victoria. It will, we hope, be the first time an Australian site is awarded World Heritage listing for its Indigenous cultural value, recognising 6,000 years of management by the Gunditjamara people. Six traditional owners will be in Azerbaijan for the UNESCO meeting, and Bob Hawke would have been the first to give them a cheer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was a larrikin Australian whose laugh would stand out in any public bar and whose voice would echo powerfully on the world stage. It was Mr Hawke's capacity to influence world leaders that would see a permanent ban on mining in Antarctica. This was no easy fight, but his work with French Prime Minister Michel Rocard in the late 1980s to lobby the Antarctic Treaty nations would lead to the signing of the Madrid protocol on environmental protection, the protocol which safeguards Antarctica to this day. His contribution continues to be recognised by the Australian Antarctic Division with the prestigious RJL Hawke postdoctoral fellowship for Antarctic environmental science, awarded every two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been a farmer and a member of my local Landcare organisation, I would pay tribute to another of his environmental legacies, the national Landcare movement. This involves everyday Australians and landholders working with government to protect our biodiversity and natural resources. It is a vibrant and important part of so many rural communities, one that encourages sustainable agriculture, and it remains a cornerstone of our environmental policy. When Bob Hawke was just shy of his 88th birthday, he lent his face and name to a brand of beer. His royalties were donated to Landcare Australia to protect our natural resources, so members and senators may bear that in mind later today—in moderation, of course!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am honoured to stand before this House and recognise the important environmental legacy of Australia's 23rd Prime Minister, the Hon. Robert James Lee Hawke AC, and I extend my sincere condolences to his wife, Blanche, his children and his grandchildren. I add my thoughts and prayers to all who mourn him today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AN3" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I rise to extend my condolences to Bob Hawke's wife, Blanche, and his children, extended family and friends. I'd also like to make reference to Craig Emerson, a long-time friend of Bob's and someone who really was very supportive of Bob and Blanche through a very difficult period in recent years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You could spend so much time talking about Bob Hawke. We've only got limited time, of course, and everyone wants to contribute in this place, but I can't recall a time in my life when I don't remember Bob Hawke. As a child, I could remember him on television as the larrikin union leader—well before he was Prime Minister. I can vividly remember him on television: often on the news, often being involved in national disputes and, most usually, looking to reconcile those great disputes. He was a person and a public figure already, well before he had entered this place. It was a very unusual thing to think that someone could have such a fully formed public presence before entering this place, but Bob Hawke had that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been touched upon but not enough so far in this important motion is the importance of his role as a union leader before he became a member of parliament and, of course, the Prime Minister of this great nation. He was at first a researcher, a forensic researcher, at the age of 29, in 1958, at the ACTU. And he of course was someone of a different nature, of a different calibre perhaps but certainly of a different time to many of the people he was surrounded by at the ACTU. He was a Rhodes scholar, university educated and surrounded by men—and, indeed, it was men then, in 1958—that were self-educated. They'd been deprived of the opportunities of education, they had come from the wrong side of the tracks and working-class families, and of course did not have the same opportunities as others back then. But he was always of the view that these self-educated union officials helped inform his world view well before he came to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You think about it in these terms: he spent just over 11 years in parliament; he spent 22 years in the union movement as a researcher and then as a brilliant, compelling and persuasive advocate on behalf of the union movement, and then finally, for 11 years, as the leader of the ACTU. And I think that was very much an important part of his experience that provided him the ability to be such a great Prime Minister, to be such a great chair of a Westminster cabinet and, indeed, to fulfil a remarkable legacy. And you could spend all of your contribution to this motion discussing one reform of the Hawke government, because there were so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is I believe the Hawke government still stands as the best government we've seen in this nation's history. We can argue whether indeed wartime prime ministers were under more pressure, endured more challenge, suffered through the pressures and therefore deserve to be seen as the greatest prime ministers, particularly in the case of John Curtin. But I don't think anyone can argue that the breadth and depth of reform of the Hawke government does not stand as the exemplar of government in this nation since Federation. And that's why we see contributions in this place that are generous and that acknowledge the extent of the reforms of the Hawke government from this side of the chamber and indeed from the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many things you could touch upon. I just want to repeat some and others I may want to touch upon that haven't been emphasised: opening up our economy to the world, floating the dollar and establishing the accord, which was absolutely instrumental to the reforms of the Hawke government. Without the accord, the social wage could not have happened. Without the consensus with the union movement and the business community, we could not have seen these fundamental reforms happen in this nation. It was Bob Hawke, of course relying upon his friends in the union movement, reaching across to the business community and saying: 'You have a national obligation to help restructure our economy so we can modernise this nation in the nation's interest.' And it was that leadership that was so outstanding that allowed many of these reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go on: the creation of Medicare—remember, that's the return of universal health care after the abolition of Medibank by the previous conservative government and we should not forget that; recognising Uluru; saving the Daintree; ensuring the Franklin flows; protecting the Antarctic; and improving the retention rates of year 12 students from 30 to 80 per cent. That transformed the opportunities for young people in tertiary education, opening up universities so that people could become better skilled, better educated—indeed for themselves an important thing, but of course important for this nation to have a knowledgeable and skilled workforce. These things happened under the Hawke government, and they were not things that necessarily would have happened if there'd been another government of another hue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I respect and acknowledge the sincere condolences that have been expressed by the Prime Minister and other government members today. I believe they're sincere, and I appreciate the contributions being made today. But I think it's important to note that we should not allow history to be revised to the point where we would assume that what happened under the Hawke era would have happened if there had been a conservative government in its stead. That is not the case. As the member for Hindmarsh mentioned, we were in the world of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. We had trickle-down economics. We had the radicalism of the right. We had Milton Friedman, the economist, who became the orthodox view of those governments. Bob Hawke and Paul Keating did not ascribe to that view, and nor of course did the Labor Party. We took a different path. We included people in the process. We wanted to make sure that everybody gained. That was not indeed the approach taken by conservative governments around the world at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course there were differences. They may have changed over time, but the floating of the dollar was not supported by Bob Hawke's predecessor, Malcolm Fraser. And the floating of the dollar was not supported by the first opposition leader of the then conservative opposition, Mr Peacock, at the time. The floating of the dollar happened under the Hawke government with the Treasurer, Paul Keating, at a time which was not agreed to by the then opposition. Nor was the creation of Medicare supported by the opposition of the time. In fact it was vehemently opposed, as were of course many of the Indigenous reforms that the government sought to or indeed managed to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst we very much appreciate the genuine, sincere comments by the Prime Minister and other members of the government, I think it's fair to say this country would be of a different nature and have taken a different path if we had not seen the election of the Hawke government in 1983 and the ability to stay in government for four elections with Bob Hawke as Prime Minister and then subsequently Paul Keating in the fifth election win of that era. That was critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there's no doubt that Hawke had learnt from the Whitlam era. He learnt two things. He learnt you could do so much in so little time, because the remarkable efforts of the Whitlam government led to major, much-needed reform of this nation, but of course the breakneck speed of that reform was in part a reason for the downfall of that Whitlam government. That's the first thing that Bob Hawke learnt. He learnt that you could bring about reform but that you needed to be fiscally responsible, you needed to have a collegiate, disciplined Westminster cabinet and, even if you were bringing about that reform, you needed to do so in a way that was economically responsible. That was the difference. But it certainly was something that was undertaken by a remarkable set of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have mentioned many of the cabinet ministers that comprised the Hawke cabinet over those four terms—remarkable individuals who worked as a team, led by a remarkable leader, Bob Hawke. But it's important to note that there were very significant differences and, indeed, Bob Hawke learnt from the last Labor government, which had its failings and had its flaws but certainly, at its heart, had the focus to make sure that we saw Labor values inform policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, I don't remember a time when Bob Hawke was not in my consciousness—as a union leader, then as a Prime Minister and then, after that, as the nation's elder, always present and always part of our lives. That's why it was such a personal shock, I think, to each of us when he passed. Even though it was inevitable, it was still a shock and it was a loss that we feel deeply. I think that's true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fair to say that I could mention many other policy achievements of that government, but one of the things I'd like to turn to is that, for someone who was so much against being a moraliser, Bob Hawke had such a remarkable moral compass. The moral compass needle of Bob Hawke always pointed to the right thing, often by reflex. Think about his decision to give 30,000 Chinese students a home in Australia because of what we saw in Tiananmen Square and the massacre of Chinese citizens in China. In responding against the advice of his own department and others about the particular diplomatic challenges he would confront in doing so, he chose to support those students by reflex, as a matter of conviction, informed by his view that it was the right thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He took the same sorts of values to his position with respect to Nelson Mandela. Before he was Prime Minister, as ACTU president he was very much a supporter of imposing bans on the apartheid state. Then, as Prime Minister, knowing that the bans themselves were not achieving results, he led the Commonwealth and other Commonwealth countries to put investment bans on that country until we saw the end of apartheid. My colleagues have already mentioned the great appreciation that Nelson Mandela expressed to Bob Hawke, after his release. We were the first non-African country that Nelson Mandela visited after his release. Indeed, the ACTU was one of the first places he went, because the unions and Bob Hawke were very much instrumental in putting pressure on that regime in order to see the release of that remarkable historical figure and humanitarian, Nelson Mandela. These are the achievements of a great, great leader, and Bob Hawke should be remembered in that manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish on one final thing. We've heard about the way he touched everybody's hearts. He always gave you the impression that you were a close friend. Even though I'm not going to for a moment pretend that he was a close friend of mine—although I knew him for a long time—he always gave the impression when we met that there was some sort of intimate relationship. I think that was his remarkable skill: the way he dealt with people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was one occasion, if I may finish on this note, that just really sums up the man himself. I was in Darwin with my wife, Jodi Dack, and daughter, Una Rose. We were in Darwin; we had had a holiday. I noticed Bob Hawke coming into the Qantas lounge. It was packed. That longue was absolutely packed that day. There were no seats anywhere. As soon as I saw him coming, I grabbed the Qantas staff and said: 'We have to find some chairs. Bob Hawke has turned up.' He wasn't as young as he once was, and I wanted to make sure he was comfortable as we waited for our respective planes. We sorted that out. I ushered Bob over. He was accompanied by his great support. I said, 'I have some seats for you, Bob.' He said, 'Thank you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remembered that I had never had a photo with him and my daughter. I asked him if he wouldn't mind me just taking a photo. Of course, he immediately said that was a great idea. This is why I remember the date well—it was 4 August—because it was the birthday of Jodi's mother, Kay. Jodi's mother, Kay, loved Bob Hawke. She was living in Adelaide at the time. Jodi said: 'Is it all right, Bob, if I ring my mum? You could just say happy birthday to my mother.' Bob said: 'Say happy birthday to her? I'm going to sing her "Happy Birthday".' We had to find him some space in the Qantas longue. We rang up the number. He didn't even introduce himself; he just started a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' on the phone to a bewildered Kay, who was listening to this person, who seems like they're impersonating Bob Hawke, singing 'Happy Birthday'. He just sings the song, as he always did, completely loud and bold. He really did believe he had a magnificent voice. It wasn't just 'Solidarity Forever'. He sang 'Happy Birthday' as if he had known Kay forever. After he finished, Jodi took the phone and Kay said, 'Who's that impersonating Bob Hawke?' Jodi said, 'No, that was Bob Hawke.' Instead of just saying, 'I'm happy to say happy birthday,' he had to do the whole bells and whistles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was what he was like. It didn't matter who it was. It didn't matter how significant the person may have been in the public eye. He treated everybody with great warmth and great passion. He always seemed to be interested in other people. For someone who certainly wasn't shy in thinking of how good he was himself, it was remarkable how much he thought about other people as well. He listened to them and listened to their ideas. Perhaps one of the reasons why he was seen as such a great Prime Minister was that he listened to his colleagues and allowed his colleagues to run their portfolios and run debates in a way that really brought the best out of people. He was a remarkable leader. We will miss him. This nation owes a great debt of gratitude to him and to his family. We have broken the mould. There will be no other Bob Hawke, but what a remarkable thing for this country to have such a great Prime Minister for such for an important period in our history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  Facing a Dennis Lillee bouncer, spending an hour at the track with Bart Cummings and having a beer with Bob Hawke are all things that I would have loved to have done as a young man growing up. From everything we've heard from these speeches today and everything else that has been said, Bob Hawke had a unique ability. He could be equally at home at Oxford, getting his Rhodes Scholarship, and equally at home at a pub anywhere across the nation. He could be at home in a boardroom, he could be at home in a classroom, he could be at home around a cabinet table and he could be equally at home around a kitchen table. This is a uniquely Australian quality, and one that he obviously had in enormous quantities. I would like to think that a lot of it has to do with the first 10 years of his life, growing up in country Australia. That's where you do have to ensure that you can walk and talk with all types of people. That was a capability that Bob had in spades. I've loved the stories about his passion for horseracing, for always wanting to make sure that he had the guide with him and that he was able to get his bets on. If I ever had that chance to have that beer I would have loved to have been able to talk about the great Australian horses, because it's a passion which many people still hold across this nation and the racetrack is one of the great levellers of Australian society. In my view, that's why Bob was probably so at home on the racetrack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what the Hawke government did in setting this nation up for the future, many have also spoken about the reforms and important microeconomic reforms that were undertaken. I think the title of Paul Kelly's book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The End of Certainty</span>, captures a lot of it. Up until that stage, we were a protected nation. We were a certain nation in the way that restrictions were put, especially on our economy. But Hawke and Keating had the ability and the will to change that—to create an uncertain economy. That brought with it uncertainty, pressures and challenges, but also—and there is no question about this—it set our nation up for the prosperity that it enjoys today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there's an important message in how it was done: the consensus in which it was undertaken and also the way that cabinet government worked in the Hawke era. He knew that he wasn't the font of all wisdom, although, as many of the anecdotes have shown, he had a very high opinion of himself. But he still understood the importance of cabinet government and ensuring that there were proper processes in place. That meant that all the people that sat around that table were able to use their intellects, their experiences and their know-how to contribute to the important reforms that took place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it came to education, there were also significant achievements by the Hawke government. It's perhaps no surprise that this is the case because, as has been detailed, Bob Hawke's mother was a schoolteacher. The late Hazel Hawke noted that his mother had been frustrated at not being able to pursue further education because of the demands of marriage and family, so perhaps this was also one of the things that drove him when it came to education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasing participation in the length and the breadth of our education system was something that the Hawke government achieved. There were big increases in the retention rates for school students to year 12—an important development, because that then meant they were able to access our higher education system. There were important reforms to the structure of the higher education system that led to a significant increase in participation. There was also the introduction of an income-contingent student loan scheme—HECS—which once again became transformational for our higher education system. Many will also be familiar with another memorable achievement that he had in higher education: sculling a yard of ale—two and a half pints, or 1.4 litres—in 11 seconds, a then world record at Oxford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While at Oxford, Hawke wrote his thesis on the history of wage fixing in Australia for his Bachelor of Letters degree. It was entitled 'An appraisal of the role of the Australian Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration with special reference to the development of the concept of a basic wage'. In her memoirs, Hazel Hawke recounts Bob returning from this final oral exam on his research for his thesis. When asked how it had gone, he replied, 'Those Pommy blokes'—and I'm sure he used another phrase—'told me I knew more about it than they did.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawke's widow, Blanche d'Alpuget, listed the large increase in the proportion of children finishing high school as one of Hawke's proudest achievements. Between 1985 and 1992, the retention of school students to year 12 increased from 46 per cent to 77 per cent. In 1988, the year before the Dawkins reforms were implemented, almost 169,000 students commenced higher education in Australia. By the end of 1996, this had increased to over 261,000—growth of almost 55 per cent. By contrast, Australia's population had grown by about 10 per cent in the same period. It was another remarkable achievement. Prior to those reforms, Australia had a binary system of higher education, with universities and with colleges of advanced education that were often quite small and that focused primarily on teaching.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Dawkins reforms saw the end of this two-tier system, with the amalgamation of the colleges of advanced education, either with each other or with existing universities, to form one unified national system. Between 1983 and 1996, 18 universities were established. That's a near-doubling in the number of 19 universities that existed when Hawke came to power in 1983, and, as we in this space all know, being able to access higher education can have life-changing impacts. There is no question that the broadening of our university sector brought education closer to home for many Australians. Many of those universities have gone on to great things and contribute not only to the education of Australians but to one of our nation's largest exports, our $35 billion international education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With such growth, of course, came the need to ensure that higher education in Australia was sustainable, and the introduction by the Hawke government of the HECS system, with which many of us are familiar, in 1989 laid the groundwork for long-term sustainability. It's incredibly important to note that countries in Latin America and, to our north, in South-East Asia are now looking to introduce schemes of exactly this type so they can broaden participation in higher education. That is the true mark of long-lasting reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of us who were alive and studying in 1989 will remember the tragic loss of life at Tiananmen Square at the time and Hawke's decision to allow Chinese nationals who were studying in Australia to remain here. At that time, there were more than 10,000 Chinese nationals studying in Australia. Another important legacy as a result of that compassionate decision is that currently there are 150,000 Chinese nationals studying in Australia today. I have no doubt that the decision taken after Tiananmen Square in 1989 has led to the continued use by Chinese nationals of our higher education system. It is wonderful that the government has been able to announce today the scholarship program that will bear Bob Hawke's name. There is no question that education was one of the things that he was incredibly proud of, not only of his own but of what he was able to do to increase Australians' participation in our education system. It is a legacy that is not only still being felt in Australia today but across the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I take this moment to pass on my sympathies to Bob Hawke's family. He obviously had a life and a family that had its trials, tribulations and joys like all Australian families. But there is no question that we have lost a great Australian. I wish to pass on my sympathies and my condolences to the Hawke family.</span>

In starting, I thank the government for allowing the extent of this debate to occur in this chamber—the chamber in which the first Prime Minister to speak was Robert James Lee Hawke. I also thank the Prime Minister for establishing the award in Mr Hawke's name to be given to students of excellence, and I think that is certainly fitting of the memory of Bob Hawke. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been said of Bob Hawke so far and much more is yet to be said, but he certainly was a man who believed in Australia, and I think it's fair to say that Australia believed in him. He was a true son of the labour movement, but I believe, beyond that, he was probably Australia's greatest agent of change. There is no doubt that our nation will be forever in his debt, I think, for the magnitude of change that occurred under his leadership as such, not only the structural reform of our economy but also our outlook as a nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a young union official at the time, I was in awe of Bob Hawke's passion and determination that championed the lives of working men and women. I remember how he inspired us in his capacity as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Even then, as President of the ACTU, he was a household name—he was as well known as any public official in the land at that stage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember him being at the forefront of major industrial disputes. He was a skilled negotiator, a fantastic advocate in the Industrial Relations Commission. But, above all, what I remember about him in those days is the way he sought consensus. He was universally respected—whether it was employers, employee representatives, government or elsewhere, this man commanded their respect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My earliest recollection of him was his ability to persuade strong and powerful unions to moderate their industrial positions to ensure that workers in some of the weaker sectors of our economy were not left behind. No doubt that had some bearing on his thinking after he came to government in 1983 about the prices and income accord—the idea of a social wage. That was certainly born out of that, but I saw that in evidence when he was leading the ACTU. He genuinely cared for all workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of us know him as Australia's longest-serving Labor Prime Minister. He will be forever remembered for his work in transforming the framework, particularly the economic framework, of this country. He and Paul Keating were such a formidable duo. It wasn't that they did this by strength; they did it by encouraging people with the argument that we can be better. He deregulated the financial sector. He floated the Australian dollar. He opened up our economy to the world. He caused us to be a more confident nation and certainly a more outward looking country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it's not just these great achievements in the economy that he will be remembered for. He was also an avid believer in the environment and he knew wholeheartedly the importance of increasing the government's focus on environment protection. To this end, he pushed for the protection of Antarctica. He led a UN task force at a time when international interests were keen to have mining of some description in Antarctica, and sympathetic states such as the UK and the US, whilst they didn't actually have notions of banning mining, certainly thought there was scope to have regulated mining in Antarctica. Hawke sought international cooperation. It wasn't that he opposed mining there—he went one step beyond. He wanted to get a blanket prohibition on mining in the Antarctic, and, after securing, first, the support of the French, he then systematically found allies in other international arenas and he established exactly that. His effort in Antarctica not only prevented mining; it brought the focus of scientific research, which is now so critical to our understanding of climate change itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also fought on many other fronts: protection of our natural environment here at home, the prevention of the damming of the Franklin River, the expansion of protection for the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests in Tasmania, and the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland; and—the one that Warren Snowdon spoke about a little earlier—the banning of uranium mining in Jabiluka and Kakadu's Coronation Hill. He pursued these on the basis that he saw their World Heritage value and these parts of our environment deserved to be protected. He didn't do it for political expediency. He didn't do this to get a vote. He did this in the genuine belief that, for future generations, the natural beauty of our country needed to be preserved. In his own words, he said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The essence of power is the knowledge that what you do is going to have an effect, not just an immediate but perhaps a lifelong effect, on the happiness and wellbeing of millions of people …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We just heard the Minister for Education speak, and I thank him for the words he said. Bob Hawke's investment in education and his investment in universal healthcare are a stark reminder that he worked not only for Australia; he worked for every Australian. By the way, at the start of Bob Hawke's prime ministership in 1983, only three out of every 10 kids completed high school—three out of 10. By the time he left the prime ministership, it was eight out of 10. He set us on the path of becoming a smarter nation. The benefits that flowed from that were improvements in tertiary education, the HECS scheme that followed et cetera. Really, getting more young Australians to finish high school did materially affect where we are now. He really set out to create a smarter nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through his more persuasive efforts, he certainly convinced significant elements of the trade union movement in this country that looking after workers wasn't just about awards and rates of pay but also included looking after the dignity of people in their retirement. In 1983, when he became Prime Minister, very few blue-collar workers enjoyed retirement benefits. Through his efforts we saw the birth of universal superannuation, one of the greatest advances for workers in generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had an unshakable belief in our nation's potential. He thought that we could be a better nation, and in his government he set about achieving that. He had a very down-to-earth manner about him. He was a genuine personality, and Australians followed him over the eight years of his prime ministership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things that I do remember vividly is how moved he was and how affected he was following the massacre at Tiananmen Square. He felt that so personally, and it was right that, following Tiananmen Square, he let thousands of Chinese students who were studying remain in this country. It also showed his great depth of humanitarian spirit. But for me—and the member for McMahon at the table, the member for Werriwa and those of us who have the honour of representing some of the most multicultural communities in this country—the efforts of Bob Hawke also led to our nation becoming a more inclusive and open country. We are now certainly the net beneficiaries of the extent of immigration that has occurred in our land. But we have also seen the great depth of humanitarian spirit that did flow from those efforts, particularly as a result of the massacre in Tiananmen Square.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I leave his humanitarian aspects, what I think has also got to be seen as an enduring legacy of Bob Hawke is his work to end apartheid in South Africa and his efforts to free Nelson Mandela. It was his selfless and forward thinking that really reinvigorated the Australian spirit—namely, we can make a difference for the better in our world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following our defeat in 2013 and as we moved into 2014, as the Chief Opposition Whip, I thought that it would be beneficial if we had a function where we got caucus members—and also, importantly, their staff—together. It wasn't to put bandaids on things, but I think we did need to reinvigorate our party at that stage. And we thought: who would we get who would inspire the notion of Labor and get us back fighting for reform, fighting for change—those things that Labor's best known for? We actually got Bob Hawke to come, and it wasn't difficult. He asked me, 'What do you want me to do?' and I said: 'If you could, just speak to the dinner for maybe 10 to 15 minutes. Just give people a bit of a rev-up. I know we've had an election loss, so you could actually put a bit of spirit back into our side.' He said, 'Ten to 15 minutes?' 'Yes, Bob, that'd be marvellous if you could do that for us.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifty-five minutes later—meanwhile, the entrees and everything else were getting cold—everyone was still spellbound by this bloke who had just captivated us. He had taken us through every major Labor initiative—social reforms whose making you could be thrilled that we had had our fingerprints on. He said, 'This is where we need to go for the future.' And then he actually broke into the song 'Solidarity Forever'. Most of us could at least hum along with the chorus line, but Bob knew every verse of it. As a matter of fact, he sang every verse with the microphone—I don't think he had it at the time, but someone gave it to him, so he walked around the room doing this. He had such a great night. Jill Saunders, who was Bob's PA and who worked with him in Parliament House and who was working with him as a former Prime Minister—this was getting late in the night—said to me: 'Look, I've got to go. I'm going back to my motel. He's now your responsibility.' I didn't quite realise the extent of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were sitting the next day, so everyone was peeling off and going. It got down to where there were only about three or four of us left. One of them was me, of course, because I had the responsibility to get him back to where we had to go. There was Bob and my wife, Bernadette, who was trying to encourage him out because they were turning the lights off in the Press Club at that stage, until one of the young waitresses who was serving the tables actually came out. One of her friends—I forget what her name was—actually said, 'Mr Hawke, it's her birthday today; she's turning 23.' That changed everything. He had this young woman come over. He put his arm around her. Then he sang to her, and this went on and on. By the way, we had to have another drink while all of this was occurring, of course. When we left, the lights were going out. There were only about three of us left walking out of the Press Club. Fortunately, I had a car waiting that only had to go 100 metres up the road to Hotel Realm. I got him up there and got him to his room. I thought Jill Saunders did well by actually handing him over that night, but he had such a great night. He said, 'This is what it is to be Labor: to go out and be able to enthuse the Labor spirit—having enthused people who are committed to go on to make change.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks before his death, I got a call from Craig Emerson. He said that Bob's been having a few discussions with Blanche of what might happen after. I said, 'Oh, okay.' As long as I've known Bob, despite the fact that his father was a religious minister, I don't think Bob really thought there was another Godhead other than Bob—that's probably putting it inappropriately. Anyway, I thought he was a lifelong committed atheist. Craig suggested to me that he'd just like to have a talk to someone and asked if I knew anyone who could go and sit with him and have a talk. I said, 'I'm sure we can find somebody.' But he said: 'There are a few things. It's got to be someone who has some Labor leaning.' I said, 'Okay, we can do that.' And then he said, 'But someone who is sympathetic to trade unions.' So that narrowed the field a little. Anyway, I had a talk to Bishop Terry Brady in Sydney. I had known that Bishop Brady's father was an official in the Building Workers' Industrial Union. I was told by Craig that Blanche had agreed that it sounds like I had the right bloke, so Terry went over to see Bob on a very warm Autumn afternoon. Terry sat in the sun while Bob spoke to him. I think Bob probably did most of the speaking in between his large cigar. Bishop Terry told me, 'I sort of sat downwind of this cigar, soaking in the aroma.' He said, 'I'm not sure who got the most out of all of that.' Bishop Terry told me, 'This is a person who I've met today who has so fundamentally changed this nation for the better.' I'm not sure where their spiritual discussion went, but I certainly know that Bishop Terry got a heck of a lot out of his meeting that afternoon with Bob.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a privilege to have been a part of the labour movement. I worked with Bob Hawke through his time at the ACTU and I've seen what he achieved in this place when he was able to continue to care for Australian working families in such a material way by making the changes that have enabled what we currently have. He has put us on the path for advancement. He has changed the way we think about ourselves. This man has made a difference for the better in our country. To Blanche and to his children I offer my sincere condolences. To Bob Hawke: may you rest in peace.</span>

                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  Today, we have the great privilege of honouring the memory and legacy—and to commemorate and celebrate the life—of Robert James Lee Hawke. Of course, many people will know him as the ACTU president, the member for Wills and Labor's most successful Prime Minister. But I should reflect that he was also a long-time resident of the federal electorate of Goldstein, living for many years on Royal Avenue in Sandringham. After his death, because of the affection for him held by many Australians, there were little tributes set out the front of his former home in Royal Avenue in Sandringham. People dropped off flowers and set up candles. This was many years after he had left our community and gone not just to the Lodge and Kirribilli but also to live in Sydney as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say though that, throughout his entire time while he was the member for Wills and Prime Minister and lived in the federal electorate of Goldstein, despite the spirit of him always wishing solidarity forever, the federal electorate of Balaclava and then Goldstein never sent a federal Labor member. I'm sure it had nothing to do with his personality or the great sense of respect that the residents had but was a reflection merely of political values that the community shared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister this morning referred to the fact that Bob Hawke was the Prime Minister who saw over the end of one era in Australia's political life and the beginning of a new. When I was studying at university, it was often a common thing that we studied books like <span style="font-style:italic;">The End of Certainty</span>, that covered much of his prime ministership and, of course, his achievements. While there are many things that people can say about Bob Hawke, the thing that I always respected about Bob Hawke, even though I had different political leanings, or at least partisan leanings, was that he understood the importance of having justice in a free society. In his first speech he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… privilege without concern, without compassion and without a real contribution to others less privileged is not only an obscenity but also will ultimately be self-destructive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That principle that he held true to is right, and it continues to inform so much of what he would call us to do today: to continue to make sure that we build an Australia that takes everybody forward together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people in this place have already referred to the fact that when his mother was bearing him the Bible fell over and came to the book of Isaiah, and she made remarks about how the newborn child would have the weight of government on his shoulders. But the brutal reality is that there's no point having power if you don't know what to do with it. The weight of government is one not just of administration but of leadership. And what Bob Hawke did—and many people have cited examples already today—was take incredible stands that helped modernise Australia at the time. Obviously, there were significant achievements in the economic space, particularly around floating the dollar and exposing Australia to global competition and the establishment of APEC and the contribution it made to the development of international organisations to promote free trade and peace throughout the world. There was the contribution he made to make sure that Antarctica was mine-free, and he made a commitment to the stewardship of the environment that we should want for our country and our world into the future. But one of his most remarkable—and, frankly, boldest—achievements was, of course, his preparedness after the Tiananmen Square massacre to say to those Chinese students who were in Australia that they should be able to stay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawke's legacy is, of course, of policy. Yes, there's a part of it that's around the narrative of being a larrikin. There is, of course, the story of his rise and fall. But I think his legacy for us, to inspire us today, is to have courage about what Australia can achieve. Regardless of our partisan leanings, I think that's what he embodied through his honesty, his character and what he brought to Old Parliament House and this Parliament House as well. We should be encouraged and inspired by his leadership and his contribution to our nation. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  My first political memory—in fact, one of my clearest early memories—was 5 March 1983, the day the Australian people elected the Hawke Labor government. I remember my parents quietly going to Smithfield Public School, where I attended, to cast their votes for Bob Hawke to become Prime Minister—or, more accurately, for my predecessor, Dr Dick Klugman, to be the member for Prospect, as our seat was then called. He was also, ironically enough, my predecessor as shadow health minister. My parents and those millions of Australians who voted to elect Bob Hawke did so with hope, but they could not have envisaged the sea change, the massive revolution, nor the significance of the government that they were electing on 5 March 1983.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't see it at the time, but I've said to people since that if you want to understand the significance, the star that Bob Hawke was in the Australian political landscape, use the wonders of the internet that we now have and YouTube the arrival of Bob Hawke at the National Tally Room down the road here in Canberra; see the aura he had as he and Hazel entered the National Tally Room as the Prime Minister-elect of Australia. He said not a word. He didn't give a speech. He simply walked from one end of the tally room to the other. The impact that had, as the whole country stopped to watch, was enormous. He then undertook a press conference where he thanked the Australian people for their confidence and sent a message to those Australians who did not vote for him. Specifically, he said that he wanted to address the people of Tasmania, who voted very solidly against the Labor Party in that election and elected not one Labor MP, to say that he wanted to lead a government for all Australians—and he certainly did that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He did not see his personal popularity—which, of course, was enormous, with an approval rating of more than 70 per cent—as something to be kept in a cupboard and not put to work for the Australian people. He used that popularity, that political capital, as a bulwark to lead the most reformist government in Australia's history, to lead the most significant and sustained period of economic and social change in our country. As has been said, he led a cabinet of talents in a partnership with the Treasurer, Paul Keating, with the most enormous consequences: to modernise the country in a way which had not been attempted or achieved in the past. Much has been made of his reforms—rightly so—of opening the economy, floating the dollar, tearing down the tariff walls, engaging in the great productivity and competitiveness revolution, and his national competition policy. Much has been rightly made of financial deregulation, opening up to foreign banks, freeing the capital markets, liberalising the labour market and ensuring that the economy was modernised and open.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He and his government knew that the whole purpose of that was to give something back. They introduced the best healthcare system in the world, Medicare, against ferocious opposition from the medical establishment and from honourable members opposite at that point. They were determined to do so in a way not only to implement but cement the reforms. They were building on the great achievement of Bill Hayden, who should be acknowledged in this debate, the social security minister of the Whitlam government, who had, against the same fierce opposition, introduced Medibank. They took that as a model and introduced Medicare, ensuring that they brought the Australian people with them so that the reform was cemented and so that, despite the political opposition, after successive Labor governments, it could never be undone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, the beginnings of universal superannuation were completed in the Keating government. It gave Australians the chance of a dignified retirement. Superannuation had been the preserve of a privileged few until the establishment of the Hawke-Keating government and their reforms. They knew that Australians who worked hard all of their lives deserved a dignified retirement. Putting the miracle of compound interest to work for those millions of Australians was something that only a Labor government could achieve. Other honourable members have mentioned the lifting of school retention rates from around 30 per cent to over 80 per cent so that eight in 10 young Australians finished school and had the chance for better and further education. All of these social reforms, investing in the social fabric and providing social conditions and standards, would become the bulwark of our society and could not be resisted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He engaged in economic reforms that were hugely controversial at the time. He introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, which honourable members opposite went to the 1986 election proposing to repeal. He knew that this broadening of the tax base was absolutely essential for the fairness of the tax system as well as for providing the financing of important investments in our social fabric. This was Hawke the reformer and the tackler of tough issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an arrangement between himself and his Treasurer. Hawke could use his very considerable communications skills, matched with those of his Treasurer, to convince the Australian people of the merits of their case. Much of it looks easy in hindsight—inevitable, almost undeniable. But that was not the case. It was hard-fought reform not only in this room but, at some points, in our party. Hawke and Keating famously lost an argument about privatisation at a national conference and delayed the privatisation of Qantas and Australian Airlines by two years, as they continued to argue for these reforms in the party. Of course, they inevitably held the day. This was Hawke the great reformer, for whom our country owes a great deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many honourable members, I came to know Bob Hawke a little later in life. I know that some honourable members know his great partner, and sometimes rival, Paul Keating much more closely. Paul Keating has always recognised the innate power of their partnership: they could only do what they did together, and they could only achieve what they did as a partnership. I last saw Bob at a function for Hannah Beazley, our candidate for the seat of Swan, in Sydney. I was conducting that for her. Being so close to her father, Governor Beazley, he wanted to come to lend his support. I could tell, at that point, that we were nearing the end for Bob Hawke, but we had a good talk on that occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He maintained his interest in our movement, our party and the country right until the end. Honourable members will recall his joint stewardship, his joint op-ed in the Fairfax pages in the final stages of the election campaign, endorsing the Labor Party and our economic agenda in the recent election. That was something that Dr Emerson and I had been discussing with Mr Keating, as we talked about whether such an op-ed—it would be the first time they had come together in decades—were possible. They were both keen to do it. Such was Bob Hawke's keen interest. As has been noted, he didn't want to vote postally; he wanted to actually cast a vote on the Saturday for the Labor Party. He wanted to hold on that long. But, alas, it was not to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke has been rightly noted and lauded by the Prime Minister and others on the other side as one of Australia's greatest Prime Ministers, appropriately and rightly so—because he is. He will always be one of the country's great reformers. He was somebody who dreamed of what could be and somebody who knew it would not be easy but would tackle it nevertheless, because we were not living up to our potential as a country. We were falling short of our massive potential. Bob Hawke could see that in every day of his prime ministership. Bob Hawke was a great Australian in every sense of the word. He was a passionate, patriotic, loving Australian. He loved our country, and he was determined to deliver for it. He was a remarkable man, a remarkable politician. We shall not know his like again. I join with the House in extending my condolences for his loss but my celebration of a life very well lived.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I too am privileged to rise to speak on this condolence motion on the death of the Hon. Robert James Lee Hawke, the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia. Indeed, it's fitting as I'm one of only three members of this chamber—indeed three members of the parliament—who served when Bob Hawke was Prime Minister, the other two being the member for Lingiari, who spoke earlier on this motion, and my good friend the member for Monash. They both served at the time when Bob Hawke was Prime Minister. Indeed, he was Prime Minister when I was first elected to this place in May 1991. It was a position he held until the end of December 1991, when, as others have remarked upon, he was then toppled by Paul Keating and subsequently retired from parliament on 20 February 1992.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was elected Prime Minister in 1983 and became Labor's longest-serving Prime Minister, and at that time the nation's second longest-serving Prime Minister, a length of time only eclipsed subsequently by John Howard. Bob Hawke was well-known to a generation or two, if not three, of Australians. Prior to coming here, he was a well-known figure in the Australian polity. His time as advocate of the ACTU, his presidency of the ACTU, his presidency of the Australian Labor Party all meant that Australians in every part of this country knew of Bob Hawke and what Bob Hawke stood for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And on coming here and becoming Prime Minister he made an enormous contribution to the welfare and the wellbeing of Australians, as so many other honourable members have noted. I won't repeat all the remarkable achievements of the Hawke-Keating government: the floating of the dollar; the dismantling of the tariffs; reforming of taxation; the introduction of Medicare, which the previous speaker, the member for McMahon, spoke about; and, indeed, the reform of industrial relations. Many of these matters were supported by the then opposition, but it was indeed the leadership of Mr Hawke and his Treasurer at the time, Mr Keating, that led to remarkable changes in the Australian economy and, indeed, in the outlook of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his contribution earlier in the day, the member for Corio referred to the lineage of Jefferson, Lincoln and the Roosevelts in the United States of America. It reminded me of that book by Doris Kearns Goodwin, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Team of Rivals</span>, which spoke about Abraham Lincoln's amazing presidency and life in the United States. The thing about that was that Lincoln presided over a very talented group of cabinet members, and the same can be said about Bob Hawke. It strikes me that if a Prime Minister, if a leader, doesn't always want to be the smartest person in the room but can recognise and can encourage the contributions, the talents and the expertise of those also sitting around the cabinet table, then the outcome is much greater than any one individual can achieve. Indeed, many have remarked upon how perhaps one of Bob Hawke's greatest contributions to Australian political life was the fact that he was the chairman of a cabinet, a cabinet in which there were many other talented individuals who contributed to the outcome of this country. Indeed, that cabinet was, by modern standards, a relatively small cabinet, but it was a talented cabinet and did great things over that period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Successful reform comes from longevity in office, but longevity requires the trust of the Australian people. That trust of the Australian people only comes to leaders who are prepared to listen unceasingly to the Australian people, to know that ultimately we in this place must serve them, that we must meet the challenges of their everyday lives, not just now but the challenges that they'll meet in the future, and have a preparedness to argue for a proposed set of solutions that will address those challenges now and in the future. As other speakers have remarked, it was one of the outstanding achievements of Bob Hawke to unceasingly argue for the proposals that he thought were important to bring about the wellbeing, the welfare and the better economic and social outcomes for the people of Australia. We all stand in his stead in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I came here in the last months of the Hawke prime ministership. Paul Keating launched his first challenge to Bob Hawke, as I recall, at the end of June in 1991—I think I'd been here for a matter of two or three weeks when that happened. Over the course of that period of time when Paul Keating left the frontbench and sat up here on the backbench on this side until the second, successful, challenge occurred in December of that year was a difficult time for Bob Hawke as Prime Minister. It's, sadly, an iron law of Australian politics that two challenges to a Prime Minister will ultimately succeed—one can think of other occasions over succeeding years when that's been the case here in Australia. During that time, Bob Hawke nonetheless continued to argue his case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember sitting on the other side of the chamber next to Wilson Tuckey. In one famous encounter between the Speaker and Tuckey—which occurred on a fairly regular occasion at that time—there were no time limits on answers to questions, and I think Bob had been going on for about 14 minutes in the answer to one question. Tuckey famously—some might say infamously—stood up and said to Leo McLeay, who was the Speaker, 'Mr Speaker, would you put him out of his misery?' It was probably unkind in the circumstances, but nonetheless it was a reflection of the willingness of debate which occurred. I say that because in discussions like this sometimes we can be sentimental about the past. Sometimes we can forget that what happens in here is nonetheless a willing debate about a series of issues. But what I think is important about Bob Hawke's legacy is that he saw the common good of this country and what the best outcome was, as far as he saw it, and he was prepared to argue it for this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, each year I travel to your state to watch a certain bike race. When driving over there and back, it's become our family practice to stop at the Bordertown Hotel to have lunch on the way back to Melbourne. Every time I pass through Bordertown, I've thought about Bob Hawke and how this small country town, close to the border of South Australia and Victoria, produced one of our greatest leaders—obviously, Labor's greatest Prime Minister—and one of the greatest prime ministers of this country. I was pleased to read therefore that there's been put in place a proposal to purchase the house in which Bob Hawke was born and to turn it into a museum for Bob Hawke—and more broadly for the Labor Party—and the contribution that he made to this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that this is fitting. Far too often we fail in this country to recognise the contributions that leaders on all sides of politics have made to the wellbeing of this country. In Bob Hawke, we had a great leader. I'm proud to stand here, as someone who served for a very short period of time in this chamber when he was here, to recognise from the other side of politics that he made a great contribution to this country. I extend my condolences to his family, friends and the wider Labor movement in particular. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:13</span>):  When JFK was killed in 1963, Bob Hawke was a young 33-year-old having his first crack at winning a seat here in the federal parliament. He was running then for the seat of Corio—a seat that's now held by my friend Richard Marles. And so the story goes that, apparently, a breathless campaign manager rushed into Bob Hawke's office and told him, 'Kennedy's dead!' To which, apparently, Bob Hawke went ashen white and said: 'What? Graham Kennedy is dead?' That's typical Bob. It tells you everything you need to know about the man. It's all of his innate Australianness captured in one sentence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He loved a drink, and he was good at it; he even held a world record at one point. In 1955, when he was at Oxford University, he drank two and a half pints of beer in 11 seconds. About 50 years later, when he was in his 70s, he was back at Oxford University, then with another Rhodes Scholar—the former President of the United States, Bill Clinton—and he was asked to give it another go. Apparently Bill and Hillary were both yelling out, 'Go Bob!' He got it down then in 20 seconds. He was still doing the same sort of thing at the cricket until a few years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was no ordinary bloke. He was as at home at the hill at the SCG as he was dining with presidents. He was a larrikin statesman. A man with a big brain and an even bigger heart. He wasn't perfect—far from it—but he was honest about his flaws, and people loved him for it. Without question, he was one of the greatest Prime Ministers that this country has ever had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many others here in the parliament, I grew up in what we now call the 'Hawke era'. I grew up watching Bob on TV. He was the man with the funny voice and the big, wavy hair. The man so often with tears in his eyes and the man with the lairy jacket the morning that we won the America's Cup. But as I grew up, I saw a different Bob Hawke. I realised that he was also the man who gave my mum the green card that she got out whenever we got sick and went to the doctors. He was the man who meant a lot more kids, like me, from working-class suburbs finished high school. In 1983 only three in 10 kids finished high school in Australia. By the time that Bob Hawke was done more than 70 per cent did. I was part of that 70 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob's mum, Edith, used to tell him that education was the golden key that unlocked every door and Bob knew that. For a kid like me in the 1980s, the first in my family to finish Year 10—let alone Year 12—I knew that what he did was life changing. Bob was also the man that brought my wife's grandparents from Vietnam to Australia and allowed them to settle here and start a new life in the best country in the world—part of the family reunion program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He didn't just change the lives of individuals; he changed the whole country. We are a very different place today from the country that we were 40 years ago. In 1980, Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minister of Singapore, said that Australia was destined to become the 'poor white trash' of Asia. That didn't happen. It didn't happen because of a lot of things that Bob Hawke and Paul Keating did. Things like floating the dollar, cutting tariffs, opening up our economy and enmeshing ourselves with Asia. None of that was easy. It is easy to sit back here today and think that all of that was, but the truth is it only happened because people like Bob, Paul and great union leaders like Bill Kelty fought for it, argued the case for it and persuaded others that we needed it. Not all of it was supported by the coalition. Not all of it was supported by our own side. Bob, Paul and Bill were called sellouts by some.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not easy to hold your nerve and keep driving forward when people are hurting and industries are buckling under the strain of all of it. We are lucky that they did, because what they did remade Australia—one with more jobs, more businesses and more opportunities than ever existed when I was a boy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob also abhorred racism. He mercilessly shamed those who attempted to use it for political advantage here in this place and right across Australia. He helped tear down what Robert Kennedy called the 'walls of oppression and resistance' overseas. The economic sanctions that he convinced other countries to sign up to helped to bring down apartheid in South Africa. When Nelson Mandela visited parliament almost 30 years ago he told Bob that he was here at this time because of him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a party that I love so much, Bob also taught us how to win and how to govern—something we often need reminding of. As Paul Kelly said in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hawke Ascendancy</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The great strength of the Hawke government was the success in capturing that balance between reform and reassurance. Herein lay Hawke's genius. He encamped squarely in the middle of Australian politics and constructed a coalition spanning business on the right and unions on the left. The old Labor Party aligned itself with labour against capital. The Liberal Party was in alliance with capital against Labor. But Hawke sought a compromise which would make the ALP under his leadership the natural majority party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few years, like many other colleagues on this side of the House, I got to spend a bit of time with the man I grew up watching on TV. As others have said, meeting your heroes can be a scary thing, but not Bob. He was always very kind to me. He was always very generous with his time, inviting me back time and again for a cup of coffee. He was always very generous with his advice—always keen to talk about politics, always keen to talk about the party, always keen to talk about the future. He was also very funny. He liked to tell jokes, none of which I can repeat here in the parliament! He always asked about my wife, Louise, and he would often remark that the age gap between me and Louise was the same as between him and Blanche. We also used to talk a bit about death. It struck me that whenever we did, he always seemed very much at peace with it, whenever it was to come. I remember saying to him, 'Maybe, Bob, that's because you know that even after you're gone much of you will remain. All the things that you did will last many years after you're gone.' I think he knew that. I could tell by the look in his eye that he knew that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of us who yearn for another Bob Hawke. I can understand that. But people like Bob are like Halley's comet—they don't come around that often. I miss him terribly, but I know that instead of mourning him and mourning what we've lost, or hoping somewhat vainly for some kind of political reincarnation some time soon, instead we should take a look around and just be grateful for what he's left us. He's the green card in our pockets. He's the superannuation we will retire with. He's the architect of so much of what is modern day Australia. His invisible fingerprints are all around us, and we're a better country for it. As Blanche said in her book about Bob a few years ago, 'Even though his service to our country is at an end, the long tail of its comet still shines.' </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the condolence motion for the Hon. Robert James Lee Hawke. First of all, I want to associate myself with the comments this morning from both the Prime Minister and the member for Grayndler. They were two outstanding tributes to an outstanding Australian. I also congratulate my friend the member for Blaxland for his contribution. Unlike the member for Blaxland, when I grew up Bob Hawke wasn't really regarded very fondly in my house of Country Party voters. They didn't regard him with quite the same reverence that maybe they did in your household but he was respected across the board. Even in the staunch Country Party home of my parents in Sale. They grudgingly acknowledged that Bob got things done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, as we rise and make comments, it's important that we reflect on a life very well lived, a life of great achievements. Certainly, when it comes to Robert James Lee Hawke, or Bob Hawke, or Hawkie as everyone knew him, it is an extraordinary life that we are reflecting on. He was a giant of politics in his era. I grew up attending high school during that era, and he was a giant of his era in terms of dominating the political stage. Australians loved him for his authenticity and his larrikin spirit. They could all see a bit of themselves in Bob. It's tempting to think of him only in that way, until you start reflecting on the reforming government he led and the achievements, of which there were many. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to talk a little about his role in the veterans area, given my responsibility for veterans' affairs. Politics is often just a lot about numbers, and for Bob Hawke the numbers were impressive: only 12 years in office, but he was Prime Minister for almost nine of those years, making him the third longest-serving Prime Minister in Australia's history. He was 50 when he entered parliament, which is old by today's standards. A lot of members start much earlier than that, but he was 50, and it was his second attempt, as we've just heard. He entered parliament in 1980, but by early 1983 he was already the Leader of the Opposition for just one month, after which he became Prime Minister—probably the most remarkably short parliamentary apprenticeship of anyone, because he reached such a high level in such a short amount of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the numbers don't really do justice to Bob Hawke. His achievements across the board—of which we've heard many today—extended to the area of veterans' affairs, and the legacy is something we should regard positively now. Many of the achievements of Prime Minister Hawke continue to benefit veterans today, in 2019. The introduction of Medicare in 1984 offered repatriation beneficiaries the choice of having their health care provided through the repatriation treatment system or Medicare, a very direct benefit to our veteran community. In 1986, the Hawke government implemented the Veterans' Entitlements Act, and that was a key piece of veterans legislation which consolidated all the repatriation legislation and removed some of the anomalies, such as cancellation of the war widows pension on remarriage, to allow those widows who remarried to retain their pension. In 1988, with the introduction of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the compensation policy for veterans of peacetime service shifted towards rehabilitation and return to the workforce, which today we recognise as being critical elements of the overall health and wellbeing of our veteran community. And, perhaps most notably, in 1988 the gold card was extended to female veterans with qualifying service from World War II, and, in recognition of some of the past discrimination in relation to issues such as pay and access to defence service homes assistance, no age qualification was needed. I guess that, for our Vietnam veterans, the Hawke era will be remembered very much for the 'welcome home' parade for our Vietnam veterans, which occurred in Sydney in 1987. A crowd of 100,000 Australians, including the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, was there to help try and heal the divisions which existed between our Vietnam veterans and the Australian community at that time. So, in many ways, the Hawke legacy to the veteran community was something rather substantial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In defence, Prime Minister Hawke in that time sought to strengthen the ANZUS alliance within a greater framework of Australian defence self-reliance, and he was the Prime Minister who commenced the development of the domestically built Collins class submarines and established AUSMIN, which is a routine high-level political engagement on defence and security matters with the United States. So, whether it's in defence or in veterans, Prime Minister Hawke's legacy is something quite substantial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, for me personally, I think the Hawke legacy around Landcare is something for which this generation and future generations should remain eternally grateful. It was Bob Hawke who in July 1989 made the initial commitment of $340 million over 10 years to establish Landcare. At that time, Bob Hawke said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When the earth is spoiled, humanity and all living things are diminished. We have taken too much from the earth and given back too little. It's time to say enough is enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we are declaring next year the Year of Landcare …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I think this generation and future generations owe him an eternal debt of gratitude for that decision, with this year seeing the 30th anniversary of Landcare. It actually arose from an unlikely collaboration where a joint submission from the National Farmers' Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation led to this very practical approach to managing environmental issues. I'm very pleased that this government has committed an additional $100 million in the 2019-20 budget to a new Environment Restoration Fund, which will build on our $1 billion National Landcare Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By any measure, Bob Hawke's parliamentary career was a life of incredible service, and I guess it challenges those of us who serve here today to consider: what lessons can those of us honoured to be in the 46th Parliament, in this very first week of the 46th Parliament, learn from Bob Hawke's parliamentary career?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to leave that thought to the man himself to answer, because, when he was asked how he'd like to be remembered, Bob Hawke said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a bloke who loved his country, still does. And loves Australians and who wasn't essentially changed by high office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's the critical point: 'wasn't essentially changed by high office'. I'd have to say to Bob Hawke: mission accomplished—and incredibly important advice to all those who serve in this place today. On behalf of the people of Gippsland, I'd like to extend my condolences to Bob Hawke's family, to his friends, and to his Labor Party brothers and sisters. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  It is fitting that we're having a day of tribute, in speeches, to Bob Hawke. I think he would be pretty chuffed by that as well, and I'd like to think that perhaps he's listening in from on high to all these words about him today. It was obviously a very bittersweet moment when we heard the news of Bob's dying. It is a time of great grief for the loss of the great man, a figure who was larger than life and who seemed ever-present throughout our lives, but it also is a time of great reflection and celebration of someone who has been a pretty extraordinary influence not just on the politics of Australia but on pretty much every aspect; our modern economy and our social services system have been built on the back of his legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as you've heard from many of the members here in this place, Bob and his voice, his actions, his words, are the soundtrack to the lives of many of us, and the soundtrack, for many of us, to our political awakening as well. I remember being at high school at the time of Bob's prime ministership and I remember one of the lovely radical Catholic nuns, who was teaching us English, talking about the accord—to a group of young women in a Catholic girls school—and saying, 'This is amazing. This is an extraordinary time. Labor—Labor, of all parties—is sitting down with industry and is negotiating an accord about how to grow the economy and have a social safety net for our workforce.' And she was saying, 'Karl Marx would be spinning in his grave! This is such a historic moment.' I remember that. I remember my year 12 HSC Legal Studies exam question was on the Franklin Dam case. This is the sort of backdrop to the political awakening of many in this current crop of politicians. So the emotion and passion that you hear in this place about Bob is also about our own growing-up and our own political awakening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a country are so fortunate that we had Robert James Lee Hawke as our Prime Minister and that he took the decision at such an early age to engage actively in a political life. That, of course, came at some cost to his kids, and to his beautiful wife, Hazel, at the time, as well. We owe a great debt to the Hawke family for allowing their dad, not often at their choice—and growing up in very difficult circumstances—to continue to have such a public political life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawke changed our country for the better. He set us on a new path. He gave us a new confidence and a new place in the world. His government opened our economy to the world. He floated the dollar. He pushed so many environmental agendas, saving the Franklin. He reset industrial relations. He outlawed gender discrimination in the workforce. He welcomed Chinese students after Tiananmen, and spoke up for human rights and humanity. He abhorred racism at home and overseas, and he worked tirelessly to confront poverty and address Indigenous disadvantage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Bob entered government, 30 per cent of Australians finished year 12. That seems extraordinary today—only 30 per cent of Australian children finished year 12. When he left office, 70 per cent did. That's a huge legacy, children finishing their secondary education and going on to do great things in and of their own right. Of course, in my previous portfolio, one where the legacy is writ large every single day when people visit their GP, is Medicare—that green card we all carry in our wallets, in our purses or in our pockets; a very important universal health insurance scheme for all Australians. And he said very much at the time when Medicare was being introduced that, without Medicare, there were some two million Australians who, in the event of a significant health event, would go bankrupt because of their health costs, and that was the reason Medicare needed to be introduced—fought by the opposite side but now embedded well and truly into our nation's polity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could stand here and talk for a long time about the many, many achievements of Hawke in the way in which he transformed our nation, and I think a lot of people have contributed in that way, but, beyond his policy achievements, I think there is something really remarkable about the man both during and post politics—about the way in which he kept that passion and fire alive but also was able to embed that in others. The Hawke government was the first Labor government that I had the privilege of voting for, once I had reached the age of 18. And, when I first ran for office back in 2001, Bob came to Ballarat to help. He'd been many times to our city before that, but he was picked up in Melbourne and driven down the Western Highway to Ballarat to campaign with me. There are many incidents and anecdotes that come from that, but, in particular, I really noticed that, wherever we walked, people wanted to come and talk to Bob. But not only that; they actually wanted to grab his hand, to touch him, to hug him and surround him, and they wanted to say things like, 'I was able to go to university,' 'I was able to stay well,' or, 'I had cancer and this is what happened to me.' They wanted to tell him about what the things his government had done had meant for them deeply and personally in their own lives. And that is really Bob's legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was also an incredibly funny man—just raucous, larger than life. Some of the things he did! I remember walking through our Wendouree Village—it's now called Stockland Shopping Centre—with him, walking along and suddenly noticing he was no longer walking with me. He'd darted off. I looked over, and there he was in the bookshop that was there at the time, flicking through, of course, the Guinness book of records, and at the top of his voice saying, 'Yep, still there. My beer-drinking record is still there,' much to the humour of the crowd that had gathered around him. He wanted to talk about how that was still there, and that made us laugh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, there was his incredible generosity of mentoring others. He saw very much his role as an elder statesman within the Australian Labor Party. He took that very seriously, campaigning with the likes of me in my first election campaign but taking the time to stop and to talk to young people in the labour movement, spending time continuously with the ACTU and with new parliamentarians to teach us, to engender that passion for politics with all of us. Before Bob headed back down the highway in that first '01 election campaign, my campaign office was in a 100-year-old bakery—at the time, there was a big oven still upstairs. I remember him heading upstairs; he wanted to have a cigar before he headed off down the highway. He sat and held court, as Bob could do, with all of the young Labor people who had come and were helping out in my election campaign, and for an hour and a half to two hours they were transfixed, asking him: 'What are the important values? What are the things, the policies, we should be pursuing?' And he just took his time with every one of them to talk that through. I know many of them who now have gone on to be very senior staffers within the labour movement—politicians themselves. They talk about that hour or two that they had with Bob sitting around the ovens of the old bakery as being a really important part of their own political awakening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who's met Bob would have a story just like that: that generosity, that humanity that he would pass on to everybody. So, from the people of Ballarat in particular, I do want to say we are so sad about Bob's passing. We're custodians of the Prime Minister's avenue of honour in the Ballarat Botanical Gardens, and there was an impromptu gathering. Unfortunately, I was unable to be there, but on the night that Bob passed away there was an impromptu gathering in the Ballarat Botanical Gardens in front of his statue. The group came together there to share Bob's life, to share a beer and to consider what Bob meant to them. All of those present knew that their country and their lives had been changed by the actions, the decisions and the changes brought in by the government that Bob led.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that Bob was very much known for was running a very consultative cabinet process, allowing his ministers—and he had many talented ministers—to actually do the work and the policy work that was required. He really gave them their head, allowing them to develop that work. It is why people who worked with him in that era—Neal Blewett, Kim Beazley—speak of him with great fondness and strength. They know that they did their best work because they had the best leader at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob said that he wanted to be remembered as a bloke who loved his country and still does, who loves Australians and who wasn't essentially changed by high office, and I think we do remember him in exactly that way. The Bob I met campaigning back in 2001 was the same Bob I remember from my childhood. It was that love that drove him to make our nation a better place for all of us. It is why Australians, in turn, loved him. It's why people came up to him in the street and wanted to talk to him and tell him about what he had done for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob wanted to be remembered for that but, in reality, he will, of course, be remembered for more. As Treasurer, Paul Keating once said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party makes the political heroes in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reading that quote almost 30 years later, it is impossible not to think of Bob and, of course, of Paul. Bob epitomised the need to drive our country forward, that the world would not wait for us and that government is the best tool—imperfect as it can be—with which to give Australians better lives. That is the purpose that drives us all. All of us in this place should continually strive to live up to those standards, to be the representatives that Australians deserve and to have the courage of conviction to do what needs to be done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Blanche, to Bob's children, to the late Hazel Hawke and to all of his family and his friends, I pass on my sincere condolences. Our country was very lucky to have Bob, and his legacy will last long. Particularly to Blanche I want to say: it is an extraordinary gift to be with someone in their weakest moments, but to be able to be with that person and allow them to live the fullest of lives every single day as their body fails is an extraordinary thing, an extraordinary act of compassion and love. I want to pay tribute to her particularly, and to Bob's children, not only for allowing him to die with such extraordinary dignity, surrounded by love, but also for continuing with the huge legacy that he has given to this fantastic country of ours. Vale, Bob.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to join with my colleagues in paying tribute to Australia's 23rd Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. We've heard an array of amazing stories and anecdotes of the former Prime Minister today, and it is a fitting occasion for our parliament to set aside all other business to recognise the outstanding contribution that he made to our country and the enduring legacy that, I'm sure, he and his family are proud of and will continue to be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What an amazing life! He was born in Bordertown, went on to become a Rhodes scholar, was president of the ACTU, had a very short-lived period as Leader of the Opposition and then, ultimately, was Prime Minister of Australia. He had many academic achievements in his time at Oxford, some of which were augmented by his drinking abilities. He very famously drank 2½ pints of beer in 11 seconds, which I understand made it into the Guinness book of records. I suspect that probably had some contribution to his early political success and popularity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He passed up several opportunities to enter parliament before finally becoming the member for Wills. Having had many family members who lived in his electorate at that time from a Lebanese background, I can say the way he represented that community and many other migrant communities is something that to this day endures within those communities and the fact that he had an Italian pensioners' club named after him. What a great reflection of just how important he was to so many of those new Australians, and that has never been forgotten. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In many respects I think Bob Hawke reflects the best of what many call 'old Labor', and he really did seek in everything he did to represent the best interests of working Australians. He knew what made the average Aussie tick. I know that's a generalisation, but I think he really did understand what Australian people found important, what they wanted to see in a leader and he was easily able to relate to people. He wasn't aloof, he wasn't out of touch, and I think what he exuded so powerfully throughout his life was the fact he never saw himself above the average Australian punter, to use a well-worn phrase. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His famous 1983 election slogan was: 'Bob Hawke. Bringing Australia Together.' And, boy, in many respects, that's exactly what he did as Prime Minister. In fact, 'Advance Australia Fair', which was first adopted as our national anthem in 1984 by a proclamation of the Governor-General at the time, Sir Ninian Stephen, was on the recommendation of his Labor government. In many respects that was a reflection of the ethos: Bringing Australia Together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have spoken about the fact that Bob Hawke really was the catalyst, along with his Treasurer, for opening up the Australian economy, especially to Asia; floating the dollar; reforming the tax system; and privatising several large government owned businesses—many of which had the support of the Liberal opposition at the time. However, these were great achievements that I know, from many of the interviews I saw throughout his life, were a legacy that he was very proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it's been remarked on numerous occasions from this side of the House today—but I suspect many of us in the Liberal Party also believe—that Bob Hawke was Labor's best Prime Minister by a long shot, and I think his record proves that. I think his connection to the Australian electorate and his ability to win four elections also prove that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was also a major player on the international stage. He served our nation with distinction, forging close defence and security ties with a political hero of many of those on this side of the House, including me, Ronald Reagan, and of cordial foreign relations with another global giant of that era, Margaret Thatcher and the UK. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians will never forget the legacy and significant achievements that Bob Hawke gave to our nation. This building that we're in is a lasting testament to his foresight and vision for a modern Australia, amongst many other much more important things than the bricks and mortar of this building, but this is a visual representation of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I express my deepest condolences and sympathy to his wife, Blanche, his children and grandchildren. I also recognise the late Hazel Hawke, who, for many people, was absolutely a part of the Hawke duo of his time as Prime Minister. Hazel Hawke was almost as well loved, if not more so, than Bob during those years. I can certainly attest to that from my own family's experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister recalled earlier today, Bob's mother repeatedly found herself drawn to the words of the prophet Isaiah when she was pregnant with him:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For unto us a Child is born,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unto us a Son is given;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And the government will be upon His shoulder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How prophetic that was to become in his life and to the betterment of our country. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:50</span>):  Bob Hawke loved Australia and Australians loved Bob Hawke. Like no other Prime Minister, he personified, perfectly, the Australian culture and spirit—the larrikin leader with a big heart and a unique ability to endear people to his values, his beliefs and his party's policies. He rose to the highest office in our nation as Robert James Lee Hawke, but he was never, ever above the people. Bob was always with Australians, and Hawkie will always be with us. He was a man in tune with the Australian psyche, with a plan for a better country, a determination to deliver it and a charisma to win support for it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about the Hawke era, the overwhelming emotion I feel is pride, pride in Australia and its people. Bob Hawke made us proud to be Australian. Bob and his government established a confidence in Australia and its future that we haven't seen since that era of the 1980s. He campaigned in 1983 on a platform of Bringing Australia Together, but his legacy shows that Bob Hawke helped put modern Australia together. Throughout the 1980s he was Australia. It's almost incredible that wherever you go, across this wide country, almost every Australian has a Bob Hawke story, either of meeting him or of being at a particular place, remembering where you were on a particular day—particularly when we won the America's Cup in 1983 and Bob uttered those immortal words that are now part of Australian folklore history and culture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his early life, Bob developed a value system based on equality, advancement through education, opposition to racism, and social justice through collective rights in the workplace. When it came to these values, he never, ever waivered from them in his career in the trade union movement, and in parliament and as our nation's leader. He was proud of his trade union background. Bob loved the history of the Australian union movement and all that it stood for. This came through whenever you went to a union function with Bob Hawke. Inevitably, he was up the front leading the singing of 'Solidarity Forever'. He knew every one of the words and led that song with vigour and purpose. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his career in the union movement he used his intellect and supreme oratory skills to argue, on the national stage, for better wages and conditions for working Australians. Many of those wages and conditions that we take for granted today—things like long service leave, sick leave, annual leave and overtime rates—were established by Bob Hawke. He argued before the Industrial Relations Commission for those conditions to be put into Australian awards and workplace agreements because it was the right thing to do by Australian workers, and our economy could afford it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was the master negotiator, able to lead a discussion to consensus and advancement for the workers that he was representing. No wonder he was the figurehead and leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions for over a decade. He understood, better than any other, the value of the Australian union movement to advancing the economic and social interests of Australians. He led a government that modernised the Australian economy and laid the foundations for the economic growth and living conditions that we all enjoy in Australia today. He led a government that saw Australia become an open-trading nation, that reduced barriers to trade, that introduced competition into industry, that modernised industry. He introduced the Prices and Incomes Accord, which introduced the notion of the social wage, with workers forgoing wage increases for social advancement through the establishment of Medicare and superannuation, the compulsory retirement income system. He introduced enterprise bargaining, the notion of productivity based bargaining in workplaces, which was unheard of in Australia at the time, which had a very rigid and industry based award system for conditions and the establishment of wages through awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was deeply interested in and saw the value of education. There's an often quoted statistic, one that I think perfectly highlights Bob's commitment and passion for education and the advances that his government made for education in this country. When he took office as Prime Minister in 1983, Australia had one of the lowest school retention rates in the developed world—that is, the rate of people going on from school in year 10 to complete high school at year 12. At that time, 30 per cent of all students were going on to complete high school in year 12. By the time his government had finished, that figure had risen to 70 per cent. What a difference that made to productivity advancement in Australia. It was his government that kickstarted the productivity surge in Australia that has lasted for decades. As I said earlier, his government laid the foundation for the economic growth that has seen Australia record the world's longest continuous period of growth, which is still running today. The Australian economy of today is a Labor economy. It has been the world's best performing economy of the last quarter of a century because it was built on the notion of fairness and the value of a progressive taxation system, decent workplace conditions and wages, a living wage, and a system of government payments that were means tested and supported uplifting Australians and supported education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob fought for equality his whole life. He abhorred racism and discrimination, taking the fight to apartheid and bringing many more from across the world with him. He was a champion for women's equality, developing a national agenda for women and establishing the Affirmative Action Agency. The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 put outside the law gender discrimination in workplaces. His list of achievements to protect and preserve Australia's environment and, importantly, on the international stage include preventing mining in Antarctica; the saving of the Franklin River, which still flows in its natural form today; recognising the threat of climate change; and establishing and growing national parks throughout the country is one of legend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the Hawke cabinet that made a lot of these decisions was one of the best. Bob's style of cabinet was to allow his cabinet ministers to do their jobs—to do the research, to do the consultation and to come to cabinet with submissions—and if the submissions were well researched, well consulted and in the interest of Australia he would back his cabinet ministers to the hilt. Something that people in the electorate that I represent, Kingsford Smith's, are very proud of is the fact that one of my predecessors as member for Kingsford Smith, Lionel Bowen, was Bob Hawke's Deputy Prime Minister for many years. In a tribute dinner last decade that Bob spoke at in honour of Lionel Bowen, he described Lionel as 'pure crystal', someone who was always to be relied upon and was always there as a loyal deputy and a constant source of good advice. They had a friendship that lasted for many decades and was very much valued by Bob Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many who have spoken before me, I have a Bob Hawke story. Bob came to the launch of my first campaign for Kingsford Smith, in 2013, to officially launch my campaign. He was 84 years old at the time, but he'd not lost it one bit. He fired up and got the crowd of hundreds riled up about the potential of a coalition government and what it would do to this country. I might say that much of what Bob Hawke spoke of that day about cuts to services and the like has come true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the incredible thing about Bob at that campaign launch—there were hundreds of people there—was that when it concluded everyone wanted to come up and touch him and shake his hand and tell their Bob Hawke story and how it made a difference to their lives. It literally took him over an hour just to get out of the venue, because everyone wanted a photo with him, everyone wanted to talk to him, everyone wanted a piece of Bob Hawke, and he was willing to oblige. Although he was tired, it was late in the day, and he had been doing some campaigning earlier in the morning—we're talking about a man in his 80s—it seemed to boost him; it seemed to lift him. He got energy out of being with other Australians and hearing their stories about his era of government. It's something I will never forget. I'm very appreciative of Bob Hawke for coming to my campaign launch in 2013, and I believe it's one of the reasons why I did well in that particular campaign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something else that Kingsford Smith is proud to boast of is that the Hawke legend continues in my electorate to this day, because Hawke's Brewing Company—we all know that now there's a beer named after Bob Hawke—was founded in Coogee, in the electorate of Kingsford Smith, by two young fellas, Nathan and Luke. They took the inspiration from their hero, Bob Hawke, to start an Australian beer company built on the values of that national icon. I ran into Nathan and Luke, believe it or not, on election day 2019 down at Coogee, where they were going to vote. I was on the booth handing out how-to-votes. They said to me that after voting they were going over to visit Blanche to pay their respects to her and the family not only for the legacy that Bob had left, but also for him agreeing to be the patron, if you like—the name—for their brewing company, which is doing so well. In the wake of that I said to my staff, 'For our election party tonight, I want you to try to buy a few cases of Hawke's lager so we can all do a toast to Hawkie tonight.' They spent an hour or so scouring every single bottle shop throughout Sydney. Guess what? There wasn't one can left. Bob Hawke's lager had sold out across Sydney. I think that says everything about how much Australians loved Bob Hawke. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke loved a beer, of course, but he loved Australia and its people even more and that made him a committed republican. For him, cutting the symbolic ties with the United Kingdom and having an Australian as our head of state was inevitable. During the 1999 referendum campaign for an Australian head of state, he argued that we didn't need more time to mature as a nation. Australia was and is a mature nation. We were ready then and we're still ready now. While an Australian republic may now seem far from inevitable, we remember the long-term vision of Bob Hawke and his unshakeable faith in Australia and Australians. That is what came through in that 1999 referendum campaign—his faith in Australia and Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He leaves a huge legacy. He leaves so much for us all as parliamentarians to aspire to not only for what we can achieve as individuals but, more importantly, what we can achieve together as a parliament. I offer my sincerest condolences to Blanche and his family. Rest in peace, Hawkie.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I rise to add my condolences to those who have spoken so well about the life of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. I was privileged enough to be invited by Blanche d'Alpuget to the funeral of Bob—obviously Bob didn't invite me. There's something that can be said about the way the Labor Party sends off one of their champions; it was an incredible event. I just want to put on the record the endorsement that was given by so many. Probably the most memorable speech was that of Kim Beazley, which really encapsulated the strengths of his friend and colleague. It was also good to see, at that service, the capacity for old adversaries to be brought together. The reception that was given to former Prime Minister Paul Keating also made sure that an adornment of that service was the bringing together of the ends to once more make a circle, so that there would be a sense of parting, in the relationship between Keating and Hawke, in the way it commenced, which was one of friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a man from Bordertown in South Australia, Bob Hawke had the capacity to encapsulate both the urbane and the regional and this carried him well through his career. He was also a Rhodes scholar, as were so many other former leaders: Kim Beazley, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull. He was also someone in whom—when people watched him on television and saw him from a distance, as people in the country did—people had a sense of pride, because he was a person who obviously had a strong intellect, and this was conveyed through a larrikin persona, but nonetheless that intellect gave people a sense of pride in his capacity to connect, especially to world leaders such as President Bush. When people observed from a distance, they could see that there was a real affinity, a real connection—that Australia, through the voice of Bob Hawke, had a capacity to reach out to other major players in the world and make us as one, and not to make us look like an appendage. He was a person who walked on level ground with these global leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, he no doubt made Australia grow up. For so long, we had had a sentimentality towards England, an attachment to England, which, obviously, in the time that Bob Hawke came about, was becoming a bit of an anachronism, and we had to make some changes. The most notable one was the Australia Act, which of course cut ties to the Privy Council. When you think about it, in 1983 it was pretty ridiculous: the idea that you were going to go and sit on a wool sack in London somewhere and make an appeal about an issue in Australia was rather absurd. And, even though there was a sense that things should remain as they were, Bob Hawke had the capacity to shake the nation and say: 'It's time to move on a bit. We can stand on our own two feet now.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Would Bob Hawke survive today? Probably not. What we've also seen is the advent of mobile phones and the 24/7 media, where this has turned more into cheap daytime television than politics, in some instances. As to a person with the credentials of Bob Hawke but also the colour of Bob Hawke, it would be a hard ask to say whether he would survive. I noted one of the articles by Phil Coorey where he sort of disputed that, and I would say that it is a shame that the world has passed where the John F Kennedys and the Eisenhowers and the Bob Hawkes would actually be able to survive in a 24/7 media spotlight, and that what that would've meant for places like Australia is that we wouldn't have had a person like Bob Hawke, and we wouldn't have had what he did for Australia, which was to create an epiphany—a greater realisation that we can stand on our own two feet and be proud of who we are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd just like to give my own experiences of Bob Hawke. I found him to give sage advice. I had the pleasure of meeting Bob Hawke a number of times. And the one thing that is not just specific to Bob Hawke but to a number of politicians is: as people ascend their political mountain, their political Mount Sinai, they go up as purists; they go up as absolutists; they go up with this sort of fervent belief. But, once they can see the vision and the view from the top, they descend more as realists; they descend more as people who can see and give credit to the strengths of both sides of the political fence. They're probably more honest in their political views and can sit you down—as I did once with Bob, I remember, at a lounge in Beijing—and give you an honest appraisal of politics and give you advice as if they were on your side of the political fence. So they were doing it with the best intentions at heart and on your behalf, to try and see politics through the eyes of people on your side and to try to point out what they think were pertinent issues to you. That is about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to convey, as everybody has, to the family of Bob my deepest sympathies. Even though she's passed, I'd like to also once more commend the great work that Hazel did; she was greatly loved by the Australian people. I'd also like to commend the great care and love that was given by Blanche d'Alpuget to Bob. It was something that I noted personally in discussions with Vikki over the last part of Bob's life, that she really was a person who stepped up to the mark and made sure that the final part of his life was one of dignity, one of continued involvement with his great love of politics and other parts of life and, obviously, crosswords and other things he did on his front porch. I'd also like to commend her and thank her for the work that she did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I think Kim Beazley said when he was closing, we're not quite sure where Bob finished. He was an agnostic, but where he resided at the end no-one will ever know—I suppose it's the same for all of us. But Kim Beazley said in his eulogy he's absolutely certain that a person with the character of Bob Hawke would be taken into the arms of our Lord and looked after.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  I am very sad but also pleased that I am getting this opportunity to speak on this condolence motion. I'm sure, like most Australians, everyone has their own reasons to love Bob Hawke. There is no doubt that Bob Hawke looms large in Australia as an Australian Prime Minister that was very much loved but also deeply respected. There are many Australians, including myself, who are so grateful for Bob Hawke and his reformist agenda. Many people have benefited from everything he introduced. Whether it's the introduction of Medicare, a gift of affordable universal healthcare that still every Australian benefits from; the introduction of superannuation and the dignity in retirement; the support for workers, their families; the support for education; for improving the environment; for an outward-looking foreign policy, it's clear that Bob Hawke as Prime Minister achieved what we all want to achieve here—that is, leave Australia in a better position for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob really understood that a healthy economy must work for both employees and employers and that a strong safety net is critical to a healthy nation. He gave workers what they deserved, a voice, and demonstrated that with cooperation with government, workers and business, we can achieve not only a fairer society but also a more productive society. His economic reforms with Paul Keating at the time, while difficult, did not get universal support but they have set our nation on a course of uninterrupted economic growth. But Bob was not only respected for his principles and what he delivered but was loved for his nature, his down-to-earth charismatic nature which drew people in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob had the ability to connect with everyday Australians. This connection did not finish when he ceased being Prime Minister but continued in the decades after. He continues to be revered by many who were too young to personally remember his time as Prime Minister but instinctively understand what a national treasure he was. His ability to connect with anyone was demonstrated in so many stories that we've heard in this place today and in the media in the days and weeks after his passing. This story has been told a few times already, but it was one that I witnessed firsthand, so I would like to recount it. It was at the end of a football match at the MCG as part of the American-Australian dialogue, when I was walking back with a group, including Bob and some of the American delegates, to catch a bus back to our hotel. The bus had not arrived, so we were standing there making small talk when we heard some yelling from a car stopped at the lights about 50 metres away. There were some young occupants, not much older than 20 years of age, who recognised Bob Hawke and began cheering and probably yelling out some other lewd comments. To the American delegation's amazement, rather than ignoring this carload of young men, Bob, not wanting to wait for the bus any longer, made a beeline through the traffic to the car, with his personal assistant running behind him, and jumped into the car before the lights turned green. The American ambassador at the time turned to me and asked, 'Isn't that your former president that got in the car?' I replied, 'Yes, it was,' to his amazement. He followed up, 'Well, that just would not happen in the United States.' This event not only highlighted the cultural differences between our nations but highlighted what was so special about Bob Hawke: his down-to-earth nature, his ability to connect with anyone, his popularity that had been passed down to the next generation, and probably his ability to get what he wanted as well. Needless to say, Bob did make it back to the hotel before the bus arrived to pick us up, so he certainly was able to deliver there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob's love for the Labor Party was also something that never diminished when he ceased being Prime Minister. Indeed, as we've heard from so many stories in this place, Bob campaigned with so many of us in many elections. For me, he campaigned in 2007, 2010 and 2013. Of course, I knew that Bob was immensely popular, but seeing it in person was a sight to behold. On one of my early campaigns, I took Bob to Colonnades shopping centre, a local centre in my electorate in southern Adelaide. We were mobbed. Everyone loved him. Everyone wanted to talk to him, and he wanted to talk to them. In that situation, it would be almost understandable for Bob to become distracted by the attention, but, as yet another reflection of his nature, he remained completely focused on why he was there: campaigning for me. He insisted that no elector could get a photo of him unless I was also in the photo, remarking to me, 'Well, that's why I'm here.' So, needless to say, every elector who was in Colonnades shopping centre has a picture of Bob Hawke in their photo album, along with me standing in the background. But I did learn quickly in the 2007 campaign, Bob did not suffer fools. After sitting down with a young journalist from a local paper, Bob could not hide his exasperation when the journalist asked him, 'So what brings you to Seaford shops?' to which he replied. 'Well, I think it's pretty obvious: there's an election on.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will always remember Bob Hawke for his humour, his generosity, the time that he gave to me, his intelligence, his courage and, above all, his deep, unwavering love for Australians. My condolences to Blanche, his family, his extended family and his friends. He will be sorely missed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  Today we honour the loss of one of the political giants of our nation, Australia's third longest-serving Prime Minister, an incredible reformer, an intellect and a great, authentic Australian. I never met Bob Hawke, but, perhaps like most Australians, I feel as if I know the man quite intimately. He was in some respects the only Prime Minister that I knew growing up. He became the Prime Minister when I first started secondary school and remained so well into my university years. My first recollection of him was, of course, back in 1983 in that triumphant victory that Australia enjoyed, with <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia II</span> winning the America's Cup against the Americans and Bob Hawke encapsulating the Australian spirit early in the morning, wearing his flamboyant jacket emblazoned with the words of Australia and really just capturing the essence of the moment for all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was the type of person that could do that, bringing Australia together for those key moments. Of course, when he first became Prime Minister, as has been mentioned by many people in this chamber, he campaigned on the motto and the theme of bringing Australians together. That indeed was one of the core characteristics that he brought to his prime ministership and to the character of who he was. It was one of the reasons that Australia was enamoured with him and loved him but also one of the reasons he was able to achieve so much as Prime Minister. The keywords that he was associated with were things like 'consensus', 'accord' and 'working together'. It was in this way, working with the Australian people, with unions, with businesses and others, that he did indeed achieve so much for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke is perhaps best known for, and I think his greatest legacy as Prime Minister of this country is, his economic reforms. They were indeed an impressive set of economic reforms. Think back about those reforms that he led: floating the dollar; deregulating the financial systems; admitting foreign banks to this country for the first time; dismantling many of the tariffs; starting the privatisation of government owned businesses; microeconomic reform in partnership with the states; and retirement incomes for all workers. Every single one of those reforms in itself is substantial. Together they completely transformed the Australian economy, opening up the Australian economy to the world and setting it up for growth that we still enjoy now through his reforms and subsequent reforms of governments which were elected beyond him. But those reforms are hard to comprehend in terms of how difficult they would've been to achieve and the transformation that they did have on the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Bob Hawke's great partner in undertaking these reforms was the Treasurer and the subsequent Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who worked alongside the Prime Minister. But, as has also been noted, these reforms were also backed strongly and supported by the coalition at the time. Indeed, the shadow Treasurer for much of the Hawke era was a great friend and mentor of mine, the late Jim Carlton. He often used to say to me, when I asked him about his time as shadow Treasurer: 'You know what? We backed all the Hawke economic reforms. I actually used to have members of my own party come up to me and say, "Why are you constantly supporting these reforms?"' They could have made great political mileage had they opposed those things such as floating the dollar or the tariff reductions or the like. Jim's response was very straightforward: they were good reforms, they were reforms that deserved to be backed and they were the right things to do. They were indeed very good reforms, and we still enjoy the legacy of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just the economic reforms, though, that Bob Hawke was so well known for and led but, indeed, many social, environmental and other reforms as well. The biggest social reform was, perhaps, the introduction of Medicare—something which we still enjoy today and will be everlasting. He also introduced the HECS system into the tertiary scheme. That enabled more money to come into higher education and, through that, enabled more people to access tertiary education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His environmental record is also incredibly impressive, as many members have noted. He was also a great campaigner for Indigenous rights, as the person who set aside Uluru for the Indigenous people. One of his first actions after being elected Prime Minister was to amend the Aboriginal land rights act to return Uluru and Kata Tjuta National Park to the Anangu people. There were many other great reforms, which have been mentioned by others in this chamber as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was not just a great reformer; he was also an incredible individual. Again, this has been commented on by many people in this chamber. He was a larrikin, he was a person who enjoyed a beer and he loved his sport. He was a classic Australian in that regard, despite being an incredible academic and intellect in his own right. As the Prime Minister noted earlier today, he had a capacity to feel and not to disguise or hide his emotions. He shed tears and, at times, rose to anger. He expressed joy and he was empathic as well, but that maybe that was because he had his own share of pain. Indeed, we do know a share of that pain that he had, with his brother dying and his son dying at an early age. He had the tragedy associated with his own children as well. He did not hide that pain. He did not hide the authentic man that he was. I think that was one of the reasons that the Australian people did love him so much. It was for the reforms that he led but also the authenticity of the man he was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was an incredible Australian, and we are right to dedicate this day in his honour. I also join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others in passing on my condolences to Blanche and his family. I thank them, along with thanking Hazel Hawke, for the contributions that they have made. All of us in this place know that we can't do our jobs here without the great support of the families that we have back home. Certainly, he had incredible support in Hazel Hawke during his prime ministership and incredible support in Blanche and the rest of his family as well. May Bob Hawke rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  Australian democracy distinguishes itself from other comparable democracies in a whole range of ways, but one of those ways is that Australians hold their leaders to a much higher standard in one key respect: we want them to be simultaneously extraordinary at the same time as we want them to be ordinary people like us. We truly want them to be a first among equals. Nobody in the history of this nation has passed this test more spectacularly and for longer than Bob Hawke, or been more admired for that than Bob Hawke.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the 29th of the 63 speakers today, I'm conscious that so much has been said. There have been some terrific contributions and speeches. I want to single out my great mate, the member for Lingiari, for his speech earlier on today. They have been great speeches in tribute to Bob. While I don't agree with the member who was just up, who said that Bob's most important economic reforms were necessarily all supported by both sides of the parliament, as has been claimed again today, I don't want to dwell on that or quibble with that. I do think there has been genuine warmth from his former political adversaries. I'm thankful for that, and I wanted to acknowledge that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob's passing on the Thursday before the election was such an emotional night for all of us who loved Bob Hawke and the country he served, and for anyone who still believes that national leadership can bring people together and lift them up in a common cause. The legacy that Bob left was unparalleled in peacetime. If you compare what he inherited in 1983 with what he bequeathed to the nation in 1991, the country at the end of that period was almost unrecognisable from what he had inherited. He had inherited a closed economy, a stagnant country and a divided society. By 1991, he had opened the economy up to the world, he had played a role in the end of apartheid and he had played a role in protecting Antarctica. There was the superannuation reform, there was Medicare and there were all of these important reforms that we treasure so much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was talking with the member for Brand earlier on, and we were saying that even one of those legacies on its own would be enough to sustain most of the people who come here. Thinking that you may have one of those legacies in your biography by the time you finish up as a member of parliament would make most people sleep pretty easily and pretty proudly at night. But the fact that Bob, working in partnership with the great Paul Keating, was able to deliver so many of those reforms, such a broad and long-lasting legacy, is evidence of the highest imaginable standard of political leadership in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But beyond all the measurable things and all the tangible legacies that Bob left, there are the less tangible things as well: the unmeasurable difference that he made to the country—the change in the way we saw ourselves, the culture, the confidence and the bounce in the step that Bob gave us as our national leader. Whether Bob took on the best characteristics of this country or the country took on the best characteristics of Bob, he personified what we wanted and want Australia to be—self-assured, forward-looking, intelligent and fun as well, all at the same time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the enjoyable things about today is hearing about his specific connections with ordinary communities right around Australia. My community is no different in having ways that we felt especially connected to Bob. One of those ways is through my predecessor, Craig Emerson. The former member for Rankin was such a dear friend of Bob's—more like a son of Bob's than a friend, even. As I understand it, Craig was there when Bob passed from this world. He played such a supportive role with the family. He loved Bob so much and he loved Bob's family so much that he played such a supportive role in the last days of Bob's life and, indeed, in organising that truly remarkable service, that memorial, that I was privileged to be a part of and attend in Sydney a few weeks ago. I want to recognise in this place Craig's relationship with Bob and the role that he played in delivering that commemoration in Sydney. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob also had a remarkable connection to our multicultural communities in my electorate. The first service in my part of the world recognising Bob's passing was actually at the Cambodian Buddhist temple in Marsden. They put on a service with speeches, commemorations and traditional Buddhist prayer. It was a remarkable way to celebrate Bob's life, and it was an indication for me of the different ways that he touched all of the communities that make up this country that we serve today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first memory of my life—and I'm not talking about my first political memory—the first thing I can remember in my entire life was the America's Cup win in 1983. I was five years old. My dad came and woke me up, and, if I'm remembering it correctly, it was before dawn. I think it was in September of 1983. My dad came and woke me up early and we watched Australia II cross the line and we saw that footage, which has been played almost on loop ever since Bob passed, of the remarkable jacket and the remarkable statement that he made when we won the America's Cup for the first time in all of those years. I remember being a primary school student having the nightly news at six o'clock dominated by two people—Bob Hawke, who made me proud to be an Australian, and Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who didn't make me so proud to be a Queenslander. I think, if anything, that was probably the first stirrings of a Labor heart—seeing the comparison between Bob Hawke on our news and his role in our country and Sir Joh and his role in our state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember borrowing the Hawke memoirs. As a high school student, I was the first the first person to borrow the Hawke memoirs from the Springwood library. I stayed up half the night for a week or so getting through the Hawke memoirs. But I didn't meet him until 2001. I met him in 2001 because I was a campaign volunteer on the Eden-Monaro campaign, not far from here, and I overheard a conversation between the campaign organisers saying that they didn't have anyone to pick Bob up from the airport. So I volunteered and I went and collected him. I took him to the Queanbeyan shops, and I had never seen anything like it at that point. I was a young PhD student at the ANU and when I took him to the Queanbeyan shops they mobbed him in ways that I had not seen before and probably haven't seen since. There was one woman who got him to sign the butcher's paper wrapped around a kilo of snags that she had just bought from the butcher and there was another mum who got him to sign the back of her receipt from Coles or Woollies, which she'd just come out of, just so that they could prove to their friends that they had met the great man when they were at the Queanbeyan shops that day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next year I spent proper time with Bob. I wrote for him, along with Tim Gartrell and Geoff Walsh, who I worked for at the time. We worked with Bob Hawke and Neville Wran on the 2002 review of the Australian Labor Party. I got to go around the country with Bob and also with Neville Wran. It was one of the treasured experiences of my professional life to spend so much time with those two giants, and also with Geoff and Tim working on that project. There are two stories that I remember above all about that period. The first was on the day that they were releasing the report. They were going to release it down at the Labor Party offices not far from here on National Circuit. My job was to go get Neville and drop him off at the national secretariat and then go get Bob and drop him off. I went to get Neville and, as we were getting near the Labor Party offices, we saw that there was a scrum of about 40 people from the media. Cameras, microphones and journalists were everywhere on the steps of the national secretariat. Neville said to me, 'Do you mind—just drop us around the back.' So I dropped him around the back; we got Nifty in through the back door. I went and got Bob then. We were getting near the national secretariat, and all the journos were still there. I said to Bob, and I thought I was being helpful, 'Bob, we'll just go around the back there and we'll go through the back door.' He said, 'Don't be crazy—drop me right in the middle of that mob!' The difference between Neville and Bob was that Bob was desperate to talk to those 40 journalists who'd assembled on the stairs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing was, on the same day, probably some hours later—the wee hours of that night or the following morning—after having released this report that we wrote with Hawke and Wran, a few of the staff were out and about in Canberra. I'd remembered reading in Blanche's first book about Bob that, when he was a PhD student at the ANU, one night there was some kind of celebration, and he swam the length of the fish pond at University House, which is a long fish pond but not very deep. I remembered this story at the least productive time, and so we decided we would all go swim the length of the fish pond at ANU in tribute to Bob. We did that, and that was not the wisest thing I've ever done. I can report to the House that today is a far more civilised way of paying tribute to Bob than how we paid tribute to him on that night in the freezing cold in 2002.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time I saw Bob was on his verandah. I note that a lot of my colleagues have had the same experience. It really does go to the generosity of Bob with his time that so many of us in this place have spent one-on-one time with Bob on the verandah of that spectacular Sydney home that he shared with Blanche. I've sat out there with him with the cigar, the crossword and the big pink milkshake. The thing that really struck me from the last time I did that, which was last year, was that I kept trying to learn from him things that he had gleaned when he was Prime Minister or things from his period when he was most active in public life. The really impressive thing though was that he only wanted to talk about the here and now or the future. He wanted to talk about where the economy was headed, where the jobs were going to come from and how Labor was going to be a party of the future and not a party of the past. It was really impressive in hindsight in particular—I was also impressed at the time, obviously. Now that I think about those few conversations that I did get to have with Bob, it was remarkable how often he was focused on what was next and not just on that remarkable legacy that he left. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is true that Australia is not only not the same without him in his passing but also not the same after that remarkable contribution that he made. We pay tribute to him with our words today and we treasure forever the remarkable standard that he set and the legacy that he left all of us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  With Bob Hawke's passing, we've lost one of our nation's greatest—one of our greatest Prime Ministers and one of our greatest Australians. He was a fighter for a fair go for all, because he believed in us and he believed in an egalitarian Australia. He loved people, and they loved him. I confess: I loved him. I would not be here in this place as one of his successors as the MP for Wills if it weren't for him. He gave my migrant family equality of opportunity, access to affordable public housing, access to health care through Medicare and access to a good education. I and millions of Australians owe him a great debt of gratitude to go with our enduring love for him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many of my colleagues, I caught up with Bob many times. I caught up with him a number of times over the past 12 years—more recently in his office but more memorably on that back verandah for a few beers. Knowing my work in foreign policy, he would often regale me with his stories of the work that he did and the achievements—whether it was with President Reagan, President Gorbachev, President Mandela or Prime Minister Rocard, the French Prime Minister. But when I asked him what he was most proud of, given all these great historic moments that he was part of, he thought about it and he told me that it was this: before his time as Prime Minister, only about 30 per cent of Australian kids graduated from high school, and, because of the policies he put in place as Prime Minister, after he left it was over 80 per cent. I was one of them. I graduated in 1990, a migrant kid from a housing commission. He was a legend, and it was a great honour to spend that time with him. I remember saying to him, on more than one occasion, 'Bob, the Australian people will never love a Prime Minister as much as they love you.' He really loved that, so much so that he invited me to a round of golf. I never got a chance to have that round of golf with him, but every time he saw me after that he gave me a big hug, which was fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the honour of representing the electorate of Wills, as Bob did. It has certainly changed a lot since Bob's time there, but the people of Wills still remember their former member and Prime Minister with great love and gratitude. Mimi Tamburrino, who worked for Bob in his electorate office for 12 years, told me about a time in early 1981, before Bob was Prime Minister, when he was just the regular member for Wills. He walked in straightaway and wanted to see her, and he said: 'Here, Mimi; here's 20 bucks. Go down to the TAB and put a bet each way on this horse—five bucks each way on this one and $5 each way on that one,' and so on. This was a very young Mimi, and she said, 'All right, but what is the TAB?' She had no idea. He was incredulous and he bellowed, 'What do you mean you don't know what a TAB is?' Years later, when Bob was Prime Minister, he'd walk in to his electorate office—on the occasion that he had the time—and he'd say: 'Mimi, what's been happening in the electorate office? Are you looking after the people?' She'd say, 'Yes, Bob, but the people want to talk to the member for Wills,' and he would respond, 'What do they want to see me for? You're the member for Wills; I'm just the Prime Minister.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to thank all the people of the electorate of Wills who have so generously shared their memories of Bob with me in recent weeks. I've had a condolence book out the front of the electorate office in Coburg, and people have left some really beautiful messages for Bob's family. I'll just read you a couple of those messages. From Julie: 'Bob, you made an everlasting impression on Australia. You brought the Labor Party together and showed Australia what a progressive and kind government can do. Thank you.' From Donna: 'One less light on the hill with your passing.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He changed so many lives in our local electorate of Wills, but he changed the nation. He made better the lives of millions of Australians, with the economic reforms that we've heard about, modernising the Australian economy, the foundation of our decades of prosperity; with wonderful social policy, which I touched on and which affected my family—Medicare and education; and with environmental policy—saving Kakadu, the Daintree and the Franklin and working with Prime Minister Rocard, the French Prime Minister, on saving Antarctica. That equality of opportunity, which means so much to all of us, means that much of the Australia that we know today would not exist if it were not for Bob's golden years as Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And he changed the world for the better as well. He had a critical role in elevating Australia's place in the world and a critical role in defeating apartheid. Robert Ray, one of his very talented and formidable cabinet ministers, reminded me that, above all of this, there was this immense work ethic that Bob had, to make it all possible. He had the courage of his convictions. He did what was right even when it was hard. In 1988, Bob refused to buckle on what was then the populist push for Australia to limit Asian immigration. He reaffirmed Australia's commitment to an immigration system that did not discriminate based on race or ethnicity, and in the wake of the Tiananmen Square protests Bob offered asylum to Chinese students studying in Australia. That was the right thing to do. He had the conviction of his values, even if they were not popular at that particular time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what true leaders do—they lead. This is Bob's legacy: leadership through conviction, public service through love. That is the legacy that I'll hold on to as I go about my day-to-day work for the people I represent in my electorate of Wills and here in this chamber for the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wherever he's looking down upon us, or wherever he might be right now: Bob, we shed so many tears for you when we heard you passed. We will all remember your public service and your love for us and for our country, and we thank you for giving so much of yourself to all of us. I would not be here in this place if it were not for you, nor would millions of Australians have been given the opportunity to fulfil their potential if it were not for you. My condolences go out to the entire Hawke family and to Blanche, who told me at the memorial that it was now time to celebrate his remarkable life. I want to end with one very simple message from that condolence book left there: 'Bob, you gave so much to Australia and Wills. You'll be missed but never forgotten.' Vale, Bob Hawke. Rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  I was pretty scared the first time I phoned Robert James Lee Hawke. I was 19, it was 7:05 in the morning and my first words to him were something like: 'Hello, Mr Hawke. It's Susan from the Mike Carlton show. I'll put you on hold and Mike will be with you shortly.' With that, I flicked him to hold, and buzzed Mike Carlton and said, 'The Prime Minister is on line 3.' It was 1983. Yes, I was a switchboard girl for the 2GB breakfast show and, over the next two years, Bob Hawke was a not-infrequent interviewee of that gifted broadcaster. They were a good match, and I was always a little bit scared that I'd lose the phone call on its way to the studio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This might have been my only personal contact with the Prime Minister, but in 1985 I found myself at much closer quarters, here in Canberra in the old parliament's press gallery as 2UE's cadet reporter. I don't think I was any less scared of the man we called Hawke in those early years, terrified that, in a media conference, I would ask a stupid question, particularly with the likes of Laurie Oakes, Paul Lyneham and Ian McMinn as witnesses—not to mention a few others who are still in the gallery today. But what I slowly understood as the years went on was that I was watching an extraordinary man in action, a man who could read an audience and, using language, intellect and performance, find a way to take them with him on a journey of change without them being gripped by fear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He wasn't a bloke I watched on TV. As a radio journalist, I was usually standing just behind his shoulder, my arm wrapped around him with my microphone being supported. I had to make sure my microphone wasn't in range of the cameras, because the camera crew got stroppy about that. It was a real physical proximity, and it's one which few people encounter in their workplace. You do get to see people up really close. I got to study the back of his head and his ear at various close quarters as I recorded every word. I had a moment of horror last year when, along with two other former press gallery journalists, Anna Grutzner and Christine Wallace, I was talking to some politics students at ANU and realised we were probably considered primary historical sources for the Hawke years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lingiari's comments really resonated with me earlier today, about the way that the caucus and that government worked and the incredible people who made up the team led by Bob Hawke. My recollection is that Hawke exuded energy. I saw someone gathering people to him to work through issues, to reform whole industries, like footwear and clothing, in the fairest way. I saw women being given roles. I saw warmth and respect for people from all walks of life. I saw fierce debates of ideas, which I recall as being much more issues driven than personality driven. And, as the member for Lingiari noted, I do recall how long some of those cabinet meetings went, because the media were all hanging around waiting for them to end—but at least in those days parliament had a non-members bar!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob's body language was rich and not always effectively captured by radio. On the days I covered question time, he would inevitably glance up at the press gallery—it was all smaller and closer than it is in here—and, before he delivered a mischievous line or a key remark, I swear you could see his eyes sparkle and a cheeky grin just at the edge of his mouth. At regular early-morning doorstops, where it wasn't pre-arranged as it is these days and we were just there in the hope that someone would say something, my reporter's heart would lift when his car pulled up at the front steps, because it meant I'd likely have a grab for radio that morning. I recall that, while he was often fantastic media talent, there were also media conferences where I'd take my tape back to the office and have to do a lot of rolling edits to edit out long pauses to get my 30-second grab.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So he was formative for me in my experiences of being a young journalist. I did my first overseas reporting trip with Hawke to New Zealand to meet Prime Minister David Lange for ANZUS discussions. The first time I flew on the VIP with him was to the special Commonwealth heads of government meetings in London in 1986 to consider the recommendations of the eminent persons group on economic sanctions against South Africa, where British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and he did not see eye to eye. In the 1987 election campaign, I jumped into a Chinook with him as the pool radio reporter to cover an announcement relating to his plan to see the Daintree receive World Heritage listing, which he achieved in 1988. He loomed large in my life, a big personality, and to see him on the international stage in later years, when I was a journalist in New York and London—his intelligence, his ability to have Australia stand tall alongside much bigger nations—was something that made you proud to be an Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After nearly 20 years away from the political sphere, I became re-acquainted with Bob in 2010 when he generously agreed to launch my first campaign. He came to Windsor, not an area known for its Labor roots, and after the official proceedings, which included him singing <span style="font-style:italic;">Happy Birthday</span> to me to mark that day, we took off down Windsor Mall. As other speakers have noted, it wasn't long before one recognised him and word went out. He was mobbed, and the love for him from people of all political persuasions was palpable. Having lost the 2010 election, I sought advice from Bob: any suggestions on what I should do differently? His response? 'Learn to drink beer.' As a non-beer drinker, I've struggled with that one, but fortunately I have wonderful cider producers in my electorate, and that's proved a useful and enjoyable substitute. I think he'd approve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the memorial at the Sydney Opera House, I was assured by several of Bob's staff who were with him in the old parliament in the eighties, when we were there, that he would have drawn on something he often said when talking about horseracing results to remark on my recent re-election to this place: 'Doesn't matter if you win by a nose or a length; the bookies still pay out.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many people whose lives he touched, I extend my condolences to Blanche and his children and grandchildren, and I'm pleased that we can have the opportunity to express how grateful we are to have been gifted with his wisdom, his love of life, his love of Labor and his love of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  It's with great sadness but also with great honour that I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding Australian—the 23rd Prime Minister, Bob Hawke—and to celebrate his remarkable life and leadership. We all felt such a deep sense of loss in hearing that Bob had passed away on 16 May this year. In fact, that deep sense of loss was felt right across the nation, across the political divide, across families and across communities. We also felt immense pride for his great achievements and his lifetime commitment to improving our nation. Bob Hawke truly embodied what it is to be a great Australian and a great Labor man, and the fact is he so significantly changed our nation for the better, with so many of those positive changes still resonating today. So to Bob's wife, Blanche, and to all of Bob's family, we send our deepest condolences at this time and we give thanks for Bob Hawke and his wonderful legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was a reformer through and through. He not only changed the Labor Party, he fundamentally changed Australia for the better. As Prime Minister from 1983 to 1991, Bob Hawke and his government brought in so many major economic and environmental reforms that endure to this very day. Of course, perhaps the most significant social reform implemented by his government was the introduction of Medicare, Australia's first affordable, universal system of health insurance, which fundamentally improved the lives and health outcomes of millions of people right throughout this country. Bob's environmental vision was also central to his wonderful legacy. Through his leadership, his government enacted legislation which gave the Commonwealth power over World Heritage sites, thus enabling the World Heritage listing of sites such as Kakadu. And, of course, it was Bob Hawke who stopped the damming of the Franklin River; banned uranium mining in Jabiluka; and created the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, a great environmental legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob also proved that you can have a country that treats and respects working men and women with fairness and at the same time you can have an economy that's open to the world. Bob Hawke brought the nation's powerful unions and big employers together in creating the wage accord. In doing this, he achieved that unprecedented level of harmony in industrial relations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was praised for modernising the national economy and integrating it into a global one. It was one of his government's first acts in 1983, in which he floated the Australian dollar, and this move was one of the first in a long line of deregulation undertaken by his government. Bob Hawke paved the way for foreign owned banks and institutions to trade and operate in Australia, and, of course, he also reduced tariffs. Other economic reforms included the founding of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC, established to promote participation and growth in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did Bob Hawke address inequality in our economy and open it up to the global market; he was at the forefront of creating a better, fairer and more inclusive society here at home. The Hawke government instituted some of the strongest protections against discrimination, which still stand today. But, of course, the fight for equality did not end there. Bob knew that improving the educational outcomes of all Australians would lead to a better life for future generations and it would also strengthen our economy—things like setting a national curriculum standard for schools, establishing national training and qualifications standards and upgrading the TAFE sector, together with increased funding, all played a vital role in improving educational outcomes for our nation. So very importantly, from his time in office the percentage of students in secondary school grew from 35 per cent to 77 per cent—a remarkable achievement. Student numbers in training and vocational education rose by over 25 per cent, and university enrolments rose by almost 57 per cent. The fact is that Bob Hawke's reforms to education ensured hundreds of thousands of Australians could access the life-changing benefits of furthering their education—another remarkable legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of his reforms, driven by his very core values of a fair go for all and focusing on those important matters like education, health and the environment, epitomise the Prime Minister and the man Bob Hawke. His government advanced economic reform, progressed social reform, and, of course, he is regarded as an absolute champion for protecting our natural environment. The fact is: Bob Hawke brought the Labor Party and the Australian public into the modern age. In typical 'Hawky' style, he did it by consensus and took us all along for that journey because he understood our greatest strengths flow from unity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Hawke was, of course, the most popular Prime Minister since the introduction of public opinion polls, and he used that popularity to create long-lasting change. To quote the great man himself, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The essence of power is the knowledge that what you do is going to have an effect, not just an immediate but perhaps a lifelong effect, on the happiness and wellbeing of millions of people and so I think the essence of power is to be conscious of what it can mean for others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke certainly had a lifelong effect—indeed, a generational effect—which has changed the lives of millions of Australians for the better. Ultimately, Bob Hawke left Australia a much fairer and much better place than he found it. Thank you, Bob Hawke, and farewell.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  I join so many in this place, across both sides of the chamber, in paying my respects to the memory of the Hon. Robert James Lee Hawke AC and acknowledge the tremendous outpouring of both grief and joy that we experienced at the Sydney Opera House at his memorial service. In many ways, Bob Hawke's political life, and particularly his prime ministership and his time leading this country, reflects so many of the significant moments in my own life. Indeed, the 1983 election, when he was elected, was my first federal election to vote in. I'd just missed the 1980 election by a month. I'm sure my vote would have made a huge difference to Labor's cause at the 1980 election! However, I was very pleased that my first election, being the '83 election, saw the Hawke government take federal power and, more importantly, bring in a really important agenda that was about taking our nation to its potential. I think that was reflected not only in the economic, the international and the social areas but also in a really important conversation we had as a nation about what our future was. To be able to do that requires the leadership that so many people in this place have expressed, and trust, because they know that the leader understands them and that he epitomises their hopes. I think that's very much what Bob Hawke did. It was the case that so many of those changes were not easy. Looking back, it is easy to say that it was obvious and that they were the sorts of reforms that needed to happen, but at the same time they were not easy reforms, both within our own party and movement and within the national debate. It was certainly the case for me, at that point still a university student and newly married. It was tremendous to see a Labor government take that federal election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, he was re-elected in '84 and, by then, I had my first son, and then he was re-elected in 1990, when I had my second son, so his prime ministership encompassed a very significant part of my adult life. I have to say that, when I was born, I'm pretty certain no Bible fell open at any significant passage, so, when I voted in March 1983 as a uni student and young adult, I little imagined that I would have the great honour, through my own community, of standing in this parliament today acknowledging the enormous contribution that Bob Hawke made to this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that Bob's government made significant and massive reforms that established this country for a long-term future of prosperity and fairness. Those two things, which my colleagues have talked about, have been profoundly important for all of us as we, as legislators, deal with the issues that face us. They have been well canvassed. Recognising that so many of my colleagues want to speak in this debate, I just want to use the opportunity to acknowledge the legacy of, in particular—as my colleague the member for Richmond talked about—education, which I am very passionate about. I want to use the opportunity to put on the record the great love and affection that my own region had for Bob and the great commitment that he gave us consistently. As a trade union leader, he was very conscious of a region like mine and was very supportive of us as we have, in particular, mining and steel industries, in which he was significantly involved. But also, as Prime Minister, his great engagement and love of the Illawarra was very obvious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like for so many in this place, Bob Hawke came and campaigned with me. It's hard to believe, when you listen to all the contributions, that there was only one man. It's hard to believe that there was a campaign by any of my colleagues in this place—probably only on this side of the House, to be fair—that Bob wasn't involved in. It's just an extraordinary thing. Our former leaders very often continue to support their party in that way, but the extent of what Bob did is just an extraordinary reflection of the fact he was Labor to his bootstraps. His love of the labour movement was profound. Whenever there was a call, right up to his very latest years, he was out there campaigning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly for me in 2004 and the by-election in 2002, he came and he did—as everyone has put on the record—the great walk through the shopping centre, getting mobbed by people, taking the time to shake hands, to talk to everybody who wanted to talk to him, do photos and all of those sorts of things, because Bob loved being amongst the people and he loved being there promoting Labor values and Labor candidates. He certainly did that for me. He did laugh and he would often say—because I was always quite overwhelmed and appreciative that a former Prime Minister came to help me along—'Of course a Hawke would come and help a Bird.' He had that slightly dad joke with me on all those occasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We really appreciated the support that he gave, but the community just reflected what so many have described as that great love affair that Australia had with Bob. Even years after he left parliament people would flock to talk to him. I just really want to record my personal appreciation for that. But in his great love for the Labor movement he also did that with the rank-and-file members. Members across both sides of the House would know about those dedicated volunteers. People like to be cynical about politics, but when you meet the rank-and-file members of the parties who are dedicated to the values, dreams and aspirations that you're trying to pursue and don't get anything out of it other than what they hope is something better for their community and their family, they're really amazing people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob did the same for them in my area as well. I commented to my local media that I reckon there wouldn't be a Labor party member in my area who didn't have a photo with Bob Hawke, because whenever he was there he took the time to thank them for their support and efforts on behalf of the labour movement. I would like to use the last little bit of time to share some of their reflections, because I feel that this moment is as much theirs as it is mine as their representative. Chris Lacey is the president of the Thirroul branch. The Thirroul branch had its hundredth-anniversary dinner, and Bob Hawke came down and was the guest speaker. We had the obligatory singing of 'Solidarity Forever' but he didn't just pop in, do a speech, sing a song, thank everybody and head back to Sydney; he stayed, signed books, shook hands and took photos. Chris says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout his long life, Bob Hawke always had strong connections to Illawarra workers. His government saved the steel industry and played an important role in shaping modern multicultural Australia. In Thirroul we remember his involvement in our centenary celebration as a Labor branch and his memorably leading a rousing rendition of Solidarity forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gino Mandarino, who is secretary of the Wollongong branch, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I first met him 32 years ago and numerous times over those decades. Bob inspired my interest in politics and public policy. He exemplified Bagehot's view of great prime ministers as men of commonplace opinions and uncommon administrative abilities. Bob Hawke was the best of the best, and like Whitlam and Wran, Labor leaders of the modern era, he now joins them of belonging to the ages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leighanne Hunt, who is secretary of the Port Kembla branch, said that Bob Hawke is the very definition of a conviction leader. Jess Malcolm-Roberts, secretary of Balgownie branch, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bob Hawke didn't beat around the bush or pretend he was something he wasn't. Even though people might not have agreed with his position, they respected him for being genuine and it is this that Australians value the most. His policies shaped Australia into what it is today, bringing in many of the essential reforms my generation takes for granted. The Labor movement and all Australians are fortunate for having had him as our PM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Rowena Ivers, of the Thirroul branch, said, 'Thanks to Bob for Medicare—the gift that keeps on giving.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I extend, as have so many in this place, my deepest condolences to Blanche, to all Bob's family and to his very many millions of friends around the country, so many of whom live in the Illawarra, and also pay respect to the great partnership he had with Hazel Hawke in that enormous period of leadership for our nation. I recognise Hazel's role in that. My deepest condolences: we are all so much better off for the life of Bob Hawke.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I'm pleased to follow the member for Cunningham in speaking to this condolence motion honouring the life of Robert James Lee Hawke, Australia's 23rd Prime Minister and Labor's longest-serving Prime Minister, who passed away on 16 May this year aged 89 years. I extend my sincere condolences to all of Bob's family members for they have lost the most and gave up so much of their time through Bob's public life. But he did his family and his country proud, and he will forever be one of Australia's favourite sons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob entered public life as ACTU president in 1969. He was elected to federal parliament as the member for Wills in 1980. He became Labor's leader and Prime Minister in 1983, serving as Prime Minister until December 1991, and ended his parliamentary career in 1992. That was just over 12 years of service as a parliamentarian, When I think back at what he achieved in those 12 years, it is indeed extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note in particular that Bob was the only Prime Minister born in South Australia—in Bordertown. Whilst he didn't enter parliament as a South Australian member, there were rumours that he was looking at the safe Labor seat of Bonython in the late 1970s, with the backing of the very influential Mick Young. The seat was subsequently taken by the then Senate hopeful Neal Blewett, who, rumour had it, switched from his Senate aspirations in order to prevent Bob from taking that seat. The irony in that story is that Neal went on to serve in the Hawke government as minister for health and oversaw the reintroduction of the rebadged universal health care we now know as Medicare, for which Bob is perhaps best remembered, and which the coalition pledged to do away with at that time and at each of the subsequent elections of 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993. After four failed attempts, I suspect that John Howard realised the foolishness of persisting with the attack on Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since his passing, much has been said about Bob Hawke's political legacy and there is widespread agreement that the governments he led between 1983 and 1991 served Australia well and introduced groundbreaking reforms that were in the national interest and continue to be so. It would be fair to say, however, that he also led a very competent team of ministers. And because Labor had not been in government for long in the post-World War II years, there was so much to do. Hawke's government got on with the job of transforming the economy, changing environmental laws, changing industrial relations in this country, and increasing and improving the health services of all Australians. Others have spoken at length about his intervention in Indigenous affairs, and we even had a new national anthem introduced under his leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob's strength, however, was his ability to bring Australians together. He knew that, if everyone was on board, more could be achieved and everyone would prosper. It's a rare characteristic that I have not seen matched by any other national leader since. Bob had good political judgement and a good political mind. But it was his ability to connect with every sector of society, and to win over their trust, that made him successful and respected. People felt comfortable with Bob Hawke. He was one of us, regardless of who he mixed with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a unique personality trait that I saw for myself when Bob Hawke joined me on the campaign trail in Makin in my first two election campaigns. We just heard the member for Cunningham talking about her experiences with Bob, and I can say it was exactly the same when he came to Makin. It was as if he knew the place and it was his own home turf. We visited workplaces, community centres and shopping centres. Wherever we went, Bob was completely at home and people felt equally comfortable approaching and speaking to him. They wanted to meet him. He inspired people, and they trusted him. He was still incredibly sharp and had not lost any of his political wit, even though it had been years since he had been Prime Minister of this country, nor had he lost his confidence or his skill in responding to the many media inquiries. To this day, I still cross paths with people from Makin who fondly recall Bob's visit there. I will personally cherish my own memories of our campaign time together, and I thank him for his support in my own journey to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The general public perception of politicians today is not good, yet in the days following his death, when people were frequently commenting about Bob Hawke, I didn't hear a single detrimental comment about him. That in itself is unique—that no-one had anything bad to say about him, and I spoke to a cross-section of people throughout my electorate. Regrettably, it is often only when a person dies that we take the time to reflect on what we have lost and the contribution that person made to our own life and to the lives of others. So, as we all reflect on the life of Bob Hawke and turn our minds to his contribution in public office, it becomes more clear than ever before that our nation is a better place because of him, that he was one of a kind and that we could all learn from him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As important as they all were, it was not, however, Bob's government's achievements that he will be remembered best for but his persona: the beer-drinking, sport-loving larrikin who was just as much at home at an Aussie barbecue or in the front bar of the pub as he was in the mansions of millionaires or on the international stage with the leaders of the world. He endeared himself to the Australian people to an extent that few others have, and, not surprisingly, thousands of people attended or watched telecasts of his funeral service. Bob Hawke, the people's Prime Minister, has passed away, but his legacy will endure, and he will be remembered affectionately for decades to come. Vale Bob Hawke.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  As many other speakers have said, Bob Hawke was a great Australian. He understood the Australian people, and the Australian people loved him for that. He was one of us. He could relate to anyone. But, as well as being a fine Australian and one of us, he was a great internationalist. He was a confident and respected advocate for Australia and championed Australia being an influential middle power in international forums. One of his earliest motivations for joining the Labor club at UWA, the University of Western Australia, was his interest in Labor's and Arthur Calwell's immigration policies. This led him to form an international club at the uni. He also saw the immigration policy as good economic policy as well as being good values based humanitarian policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob's father, Clem, was a Congregational minister, and Bob loved Clem. Often—and in my case it's the same—we take our religious beliefs, our values, from our parents, and I'm sure that that was the case with Bob. He was active in the student Christian movement and the Congregational Youth Fellowship. I understand from my research that Bob was actually impressed with some aspects of the Catholic faith, but he never pursued that. But he did head off to India for the World Conference of Christian Youth, and he was shocked by the huge gap between rich and poor and also the apparent indifference of some of the conference delegates to those people in dire poverty around them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Rhodes scholar at Oxford he met bright young people from all around the world. I congratulate the government on establishing the Bob Hawke scholarship for the education of bright young Australians at fine overseas institutions. I think it's important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in Australia, Bob at the ACTU and then through the International Labour Organization quickly became involved in international issues, becoming a strong supporter of Israel. Bob advocated for Russian Jews who were being denied permission to emigrate to Israel and led a strong union campaign of opposition to the South African Springboks tour of Australia. This was a significant shift in international opposition to apartheid in South Africa, which Bob continued as Prime Minister, and which led to mutual respect and friendship with Nelson Mandela. Bob was solid on the US alliance. Western Australian Governor Kim Beazley pointed me to Bob's autobiography where, in part, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was a vocal opponent of the war and of US policy in Vietnam but my attitude towards America remained positive. To me, the overriding importance of Australia's US alliance was clear. The United States, whatever its mistakes, was the bulwark of the free world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob also foresaw the rise of Asia and of China and he understood that coming rise better than most. After the massacre at Tiananmen Square Bob, as Prime Minister, invited Chinese students in Australia to stay on if they wanted to. These people, these Chinese citizens who stayed in Australia proved to be an enormous asset to Australia. Bob's act of leadership demonstrated his commitment to a multicultural Australia. I won't go into them much, but we've heard much about the reforms of the education sector that meant more high school graduates and more university graduates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hawke government's reform of the Australian economy, particularly the floating of the dollar, transformed us into a globally competitive trading nation. Bob was a great Prime Minister and a great Australian leader, as demonstrated by his actions both at home and abroad. He made us a more confident and outward looking nation. My earliest memory of Bob was when we won the America's Cup in 1983. I had just turned 12 years old. I remember it being early morning, and we were watching the victorious crew of <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia II</span> and our Prime Minister. I remember bounding out of our house to catch the school bus, and I was so proud. I can remember my heart being so full of pride, seeing that crew and our Prime Minister. I remember thinking, 'Australians can do anything,' and I remember thinking to myself by extension as a young lad growing up in a country town—not in the city, not from a privileged family—that I could do anything. That was the feeling he gave me. I'll never forget how that made me feel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Bob's love of the Territory as well. I've received many messages from people in Darwin and Palmerston, my electorate, and from Territorians elsewhere about how much they loved Bob. We've heard something from my friend and fellow Territorian the member for Lingiari and others about the handing back of Uluru to its traditional owners and how important that was, about the extension of the protections of Kakadu and, of course, about when Bob received the Barunga Statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend Father Frank Brennan reminded me today that it was in August 1988 in this place that Prime Minister Bob Hawke proposed that the first item of substantive business in this new Parliament House would be around reconciliation with First Nations people. The idea for the motion arose when the heads of Australian churches issued a statement titled 'Towards reconciliation in Australian society' at the beginning of the year of the bicentenary. For the record, this was the motion:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">   (a) Australia was occupied by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who had settled for thousands of years before British settlement at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788;</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) considers it desirable that the Commonwealth further promote reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens providing recognition of their special place in the Commonwealth of Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob remained committed, and I saw that commitment just in recent times in the Northern Territory. The Barunga Statement always stayed with him. In fact, he gave his resignation speech from the prime ministership in front of the Barunga Statement in this building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My most recent memory of Bob was a simple interaction when we travelled to Arnhem Land for the Garma Festival, hosted by the Yolngu people, where he was continuing to promote reconciliation. We were going through the airport in Nhulunbuy—or Gove as some people might know the town—in Arnhem Land, and when he went through the security screening Bob was pulled up by security for having two cigarette lighters in his pocket. Only one cigarette lighter was allowed per person and he was asked by security to surrender one. Bob didn't make too much fuss about this, but I could see that he was slightly frustrated. I leaned in and said, 'Bob, I'd be honoured to receive one of your lighters.' He simply turned to me, smiled and said, 'Thanks mate.' And I said, 'No, thank you, Bob.' He smiled with that twinkle in his eye and I was a 12-year-old kid again. It was like when I bounded out of our house after seeing our Prime Minister with the America's Cup. Bob looked at me and said, 'Thanks mate,' and I just felt really special.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I guess that was Bob's wonderful gift to Australians—he made all of us feel so special and so proud. Vale, Bob Hawke. My condolences to all who loved him so much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  'And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong.' Bob's voice echoed out across the room as he remembered every verse of 'Waltzing Matilda'. We were all captured by him and his incredible voice. It was 2014 and he was, as usual, singing 'Waltzing Matilda' at the Jack Newton Celebrity Classic golf tournament. He was the patron of what has now become known affectionately as The Jack. In 1983, when Bob Hawke became Prime Minister, Jack Newton asked Bob to become the patron of The Jack celebrity golf tournament. Bob relished that job. He turned up almost every year, and almost every year he sang 'Waltzing Matilda' at the dinner. We just loved him doing it. He understood Australians and Australia. He loved us and we loved him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't know Bob particularly well or for very long. In fact, I only met him for the first time in 2014. It was when I was playing golf up in the Hunter, and when Bob made the annual trek up to The Jack. That evening I received a phone call from one of the organisers of the tournament to say that Mr Hawke had noticed me out on the golf course and wondered if I'd like to have breakfast with him the next morning and have a chat about golf, because he'd learnt that I was a keen golfer and had known Jack Newton for a number of years, and his lovely wife, Jackie, as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I jumped at that opportunity and fronted up, bright and early, the next morning to have breakfast with Bob. It was just the two of us and an incredible moment in my life. We chatted about many things, with much of the conversation being around golf. We talked about politics, we talked about Australia and we talked about my love of economics as a schoolgirl. In fact, in 1983 in year 7, Mr Kemp, my teacher, had meticulously instilled in us the lessons of the accord, the deregulation of the banking industry, the floating of the Australian dollar, the opening up of Australia's economy. That instilled in me a great love of economics and, of course, Bob Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went on to study economics, including three-unit economics, right through school and my HSC. I always had the great pairing of Hawke and Keating in my mind as I trawled through those essays. I told Bob about that. He was mightily chuffed that my economics teacher had really deified Bob in my mind as a schoolgirl. We also talked about the influence of China on him and, importantly, Asia generally. He really understood our country and our place in the world and he spoke to me about how important it would be for us to continue with that engagement of Asia, while still recognising the importance of the alliance with the Americans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After we'd chatted for probably half an hour or 40 minutes, we both knew that we had to finish our breakfast and go and tee off. He said to me, 'Meryl, have you ever thought about politics?' I said, 'Actually, Bob, I'd like to do that one day. But I've got a family and I'm working in the media, working on radio, and I love radio.' He said, 'You know what? Politics needs good strong women like you, good communicators. You really should give it some thought.' So when the opportunity came up in 2016 for me to run for the seat of Paterson I had those words of Bob Hawke ringing in my head. I thought, 'Maybe I should just listen to this knowledgeable and great man. Maybe I should just take up the challenge of politics.' So in his own way, he had a direct influence on me being here in this place today, and for that I will be eternally grateful.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting"> (Mr Vasta)</span>
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">:</span>  You're welcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="133646" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms MURPHY:</span>
                  </a>  Early one morning in September 1983, a sports-loving and somewhat argumentative nine-year-old girl was utterly convinced that her new Prime Minister had just given her an iron-clad argument to stay home from school that day. I said, 'Hey, Mum, you know how you always say you're the boss of me? Well, if you try to make me go to school today you're a bum.' It turns out that line worked so well for Bob Hawke but not so much for me. Off to school I went.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He didn't get me out of a day of learning, but Bob Hawke, with his now infamous response to our victory in the America's Cup, had given me my first political memory and one of my first debating defeats. Many more with my mother were to come. And he gave me and very many other Australians, and not to mention people from across our region and the world, so much more. My generation, whose formative teenage years were that remarkable and somewhat maligned decade of the 1980s, had the privilege of growing up while Bob Hawke; his Treasurer, Paul Keating; and his very talented government transformed our country. It did not matter that, for most of us, the closest we ever got to Bob Hawke was the nightly TV news. His presence, his personality and the pure Bob Hawkeness of him meant that we knew that he was our Prime Minister not just the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That charismatic presence, which so many people have spoken of in this place today, was undoubtedly one of Bob Hawke's greatest gifts. But, in my humble opinion, having that great gift was not the most important thing about him. In my view, it was what he harnessed that great gift to achieve that was most important and who and what he harnessed it for. Of course, he harnessed it for the transformational policy reforms which, as we all know, spanned the economic, the environmental and the social policy realms and which are on both the domestic and the international stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also something else that he gave us which I value to this very day: Bob Hawke demonstrated to Australians that our federal government could and should be compassionate and expansive. He demonstrated that it could not just talk about equality but fight for it, particularly for those in our community who don't have the power or the resources to fight for it on their own. He demonstrated that it could take everyone on a journey of bold and progressive change that was based on a love of Australia and Australians and an unwavering commitment to equality and justice. For some of us who grew up in the magnificent eighties and whose conscious experience of politics and government was dominated by Bob Hawke, he gave us a lasting, enduring belief that that is what a federal government always should be and do. For a lot of us, he gave us a beating Labor heart, and we will forever be grateful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Labor member for Dunkley, the wonderful Bob Chynoweth, was first elected to the Australian parliament in the 1983 Hawke slide. I know Bob would have loved to have been able to speak today. I'm pretty sure he would have told this story better than me, but I will do my best. Newly preselected to a seat that we had lost in a by-election mere months earlier and thrown into a snap election, Bob Chynoweth received a visit from the great man early on in the campaign. Hawkie inquired, 'How are you doing, Bob?' 'I'm just really hanging on to your coat-tails, to tell you the truth,' the ever-humble Chynoweth confessed. Bob's response was: 'Don't worry, mate. So is everyone else.' I'm so glad, and I'm sure we're all so glad, that everyone was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard a lot today about how the Hawke government and Hawke personally protected Antarctica. It was the wonderful Bob Chynoweth from my electorate of Dunkley who, years after he was first elected, went on a parliamentary delegation to Antarctica and had a personal epiphany. In his words, he sat there and said: 'We have magnificent places like this. We must protect them.' Bob, when he returned back to our community and then to Canberra, started a campaign to influence the Hawke government and its cabinet ministers to reverse Australia's position, as it was then, on the mineral convention. Bob Chynoweth lobbied cabinet ministers, but he also collected more than 20,000 signatures of Australian citizens and tabled them in this place, asking for Australia's position to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When that went before the Hawke cabinet, as we all know, Hawke took up that challenge. He took up that challenge and he fought for something that was right, something that was lasting and something that was a legacy. My community are very proud of the role that our former Labor member for Dunkley played in that legacy. But it's not just a legacy of great policy; it is a demonstration, an illustration, of what Bob Hawke taught people of my generation, and some of our parents, to expect from their federal government—that is, to identify what is important and what is right, and then to fight for it, even if fighting for it is hard; even if vested interests and the rules of the game say that you shouldn't; even if you have to battle to take others, including the electorate, with you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was Australia's greatest Prime Minister. And while the generations that came after me didn't get the opportunity to live under his government, to this day they are no doubt continuing to benefit from the reforms that were put in place, and so will the generations to come. The great Bob Hawke will always be loved, and he will be missed. His legacy will live on. It will live on in the way he changed our country, and in the way he influenced the political philosophy of so many Australians—Australians that I am proud to say are like me. On behalf of my community of Dunkley, and on behalf of Bob Chynoweth, condolences to Bob Hawke's family and to all who loved him.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  At the outset, may I pay tribute to the member for Dunkley on a terrific first, but not inaugural, speech. It was a great tribute to Bob Hawke.</span>

Bob Hawke is your typical Australian, oversize.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to understand Australia's 23rd Prime Minister, you can do no better than to read Craig McGregor's 1977 profile. It's a time when Bob Hawke isn't Prime Minister, he's not even in parliament—he's running the ACTU—but it's an extraordinary insight into the man.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… he is the focus of a great deal of affection right across the spectrum: men, women, workers, sportsmen, businessmen. It buoys him up, even exhilarates him, but he remains easygoing, serious, arguing or defending himself when necessary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… a press conference by Hawke isn't just a <span style="font-style:italic;">conference</span>, it's a media extravaganza, a glamourfest, a promotional wonder like those MGM spectaculars of old, in which Hawke plays King to his adoring court, fences and jibes with his carping Lords, puts down the media Fool, works himself into a lather of anger at The Enemy Outside, and finally sends his audience home, as after an Aristotelian tragedy, exhausted, admiring, and experiencing the exquisite pleasure of catharsis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his 3,207 days as Prime Minister, Bob Hawke saw Australia through an accord, ACT self-government, saving the Franklin, banning uranium mining in Jabiluka, handing back Uluru to its traditional owners, establishing APEC, an economic summit and floating the dollar. And there were many reforms that were not supported by the other side of the House: the Sex Discrimination Act, Medicare, capital gains taxation, fringe benefits taxation and asset-testing the pension. But the one reform I want to focus on today was his opening up of the Australian economy by bringing down the tariff walls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was at university I wrote, in 1994, an honours thesis on trade liberalisation and the Australian Labor Party. I was puzzled as to why Australia brought down our tariff walls not because other countries were going to do it as part of a deal, but unilaterally. And why in other countries it had been conservatives that brought down the tariff walls, whereas in Australia it was a party of the Left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1994, 25 years ago, Bob Hawke was good enough to sit down with me for an interview. He told me that his commitment to tariff cuts went right back to when he was studying economics at the University of Western Australia in 1951-52. He said, 'I was intellectually a free trader from my earliest thinking days.' I asked him about the extraordinary moment in 1973 when Whitlam cut tariffs by 25 per cent without consulting Hawke, and Hawke, as the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, put out a statement which cautiously defended it. He told me his philosophical belief in the need to reduce industry protection meant that he agreed with the principle of the decision. It is hard for me to think of a trade union leader in the modern era who would have such a response to a unilateral tariff cut which he got no warning about beforehand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He not only was ahead of his time but was also a markedly different trade union leader in his approach to modernising the Australian economy. In late 1983, he was talking about the importance of reducing tariff rates for the sake of Australian industry. He argued protection had 'dulled the entrepreneurial spirit and reduced the competitive pressures for high performances by a number of Australian manufacturers'. His government was to go on and cut tariffs in 1988 and again in 1991. He said that in his view the most central reason for wanting to cut tariffs was that Australia was at our best when we engaged with the world. He told me: 'I'm basically an internationalist. As I said in the very first days of becoming Prime Minister, Australia's future involves becoming more enmeshed with Asia. You can't pursue that policy of enmeshment behind high tariff walls.' As his former speechwriter Stephen Mills said, 'In Hawke's mind, resurgent protectionism, if not adequately restrained, threatened the very peace and security of the world.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is better off because of so many achievements of the Hawke government, but in his leadership in trade liberalisation he modernised the Labor Party as much as in any other issue. It brought a greater dose of competition to the economy and it reminded us that to be a social democrat, to be a progressive, to be a member of the Labor Party, is to be an internationalist—to believe that Australia is at our best when we choose openness.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I am honoured to rise to speak today to the condolence motion on the death of Robert J Hawke. I'd just like to say that this is my very first speech at the dispatch box as a shadow assistant minister and I'm very pleased that it is on this motion. It's an honour and a privilege to have held the same office as such a great man—President of the ACTU. Recently, at his memorial service in Sydney, I was lucky enough to have a chat with his daughter Sue, who seems to me very much like her father. She told me that people used to ask her, 'What is it like growing up with a Prime Minister for a father?' She said she would reply by saying, 'Actually, I grew up with a trade unionist as a father.' He always was and always will be a unionist first and foremost. I'd like at this point to offer my condolences to Bob Hawke's family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a past ACTU president myself, I'd like to use this moment to reflect on his time at that great institution, the home of the trade union movement. He started there in 1958 as the ACTU's first paid researcher and advocate, and in those halls of the arbitration commission, as it was called then, he quickly became widely recognised as the industrial relation system's best advocate. He and his trusty colleague Ralph Willis, who became a lifelong friend and colleague, would take on highly paid and fussy QCs. Advocating with assiduousness but also with alacrity and without fear and without reverence—but always with respect—he formed firm friendships and connections. His network was vast across unions, businesses, politics and broader society. He ran many famous and successful cases on behalf of trade unions and their members. My good friend, Zelda D'Aprano, who died very recently, worked for the Meatworkers Union and infamously chained herself to the Commonwealth buildings in Melbourne to raise the issue of equal pay for women. She was in the arbitration commission the day the union won the landmark case for equal pay, with Bob Hawke acting on behalf of the union. I've noticed that she appears in all of those iconic photos of that day with Bob. It was, of course, an outcome as a result of Zelda and her fellow feminist activists, but it was also a victory for the ACTU and Bob, who navigated the intricacies of the industrial legal case and won. Mind you, he was not one known for promoting women at the ACTU, one thing that I took up with him once when we were campaigning together in Macquarie for the excellent Susan Templeman in 2016. He did sort of agree with me that that was the case, but he said, 'Ged, there just didn't seem to be any women around in those days to do those jobs.' On seeing my response—my raised eyebrow and the look on my face—he quickly acknowledged that he was obviously being very short sighted. He battled demons of course and he was very human, but he seemed to be a human we constantly forgave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians saw him as a normal person—one of them. His love of horseracing is now legendary. If you do the tour of Old Parliament House, they sometimes tell you how he sat at his desk in his office every single morning at exactly the same time and had a cuppa and a cigarette to study the guide and get his bets on. He did this so regularly that he was deemed a security risk. You see, he sat with his back to a great big window that could easily be seen by snipers who knew his routine, but he absolutely refused to do it anywhere else or at any other time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ralph Willis tells the story of Bob winning Father of the Year. Although the bestowers of the award thought it was a good idea, apparently Hazel Hawke did not. Ralph said Bob had an inkling Hazel would not so be happy and asked Ralph and his wife to go home with him that night. On entering the house, Ralph said they were greeted with flying missiles thrown at Bob by Hazel, swearing loudly about his prize and making it very clear she didn't think he deserved it. So, yes, he was human, but we know, in fact, in our eyes, he was superhuman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Kelty said that when Bob became president of the ACTU, we had seen nothing like him ever before. He tackled massive issues from there. As well as finding ways through difficult industrial disputes and issues, Bob, for example, took on the big retail and price maintenance monopolies. He thought big and he acted big. He maintained the roles of president of the ALP and the ACTU at the same time, and, as we heard this morning, he joked about being able to ride two horses at the same time in the circus. But, for me, this was a golden achievement. Not only workload wise but in a very public demonstration, he showed that we are a labour movement together—political and industrial arms working towards the same goals. That's something I believe, passionately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke raised the broader political consciousness of the union movement at that time. He argued in one trade union support to campaign against apartheid and such was the Australian union movement's impact on that issue that Nelson Mandela visited Australia first off the rank after his release from prison to thank the trade union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob threw himself into the world's troubles. He was on the governing body of the International Labour Organization in the position I held. I know the vital nature of its work only too well. He was still spoken of almost in hush tones at the ILO when I was there. Australia is still looked to in that place for leadership and big ideas. The links with world employers, unions and governments that he formed at the ILO were great practice for Bob for when he became Prime Minister. That period prepared him well for the transition to leading his country where he so ably managed massive objectives, such as establishing APEC. He took up hard issues and he was revered worldwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He left the ACTU in the capable hands of the amazing Bill Kelty, who had learned from him and continued to work with him and his government. They continued with that great view that the labour movement was best when the labour and political arms worked together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish by remembering what Kelty said about Bob Hawke. He said Bob had an 'undiluted belief in the power of education', an 'undiluted belief in the power of democracy' and a 'belief in unions and the ALP and this thing he called Australia'—not simply a piece of geography but a belief. I agree with Kelty. Bob did this country a power of good, did working people a power of good and did many right around the world a power of good. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  Today the parliament is farewelling a giant of Australian politics and one of our great leaders. Bob Hawke will be remembered in many ways: as a Rhodes scholar and a man of the people, as a drinker and a teetotaller, as a social reformer and an economic reformer, as a larrikin and an international statesman, and as a rogue and a bleeding heart. Like all of the greats, he contained multitudes. He was a lover of Australia and its people, but he was a man who loved Australia enough to want to change it. And what a legacy of change he left—floating the dollar and opening the Australian economy to international competition and competitiveness; the accord; Landcare; the Sex Discrimination Act; saving the Franklin River, and World Heritage preservation; lifting the proportion of Australians who finished school from three in 10 to eight in 10; APEC; and giving Australia our own national symbols and anthem, and green and gold as our national colours. He was the architect of modern Australia and he was the painter of a vision of a nation who could dream of bigger things. He achieved all of this because he was a leader. He was famously committed to consensus, a consensus model of leadership. He brought Australians with him as he changed the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the changes that Hawke implemented were not uniformly supported in this parliament or in this country when Hawke embarked on them. Indeed, I was amused to come across this press release from John Howard at the time, criticising Bob Hawke, 'Mr Hawke's obsession with consensus harming tax reform'. John Howard said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Hawke must drop his obsession with consensus. That this is nothing but Government by lowest common denominator is vividly demonstrated by the current tax debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the tax debate that introduced capital gains tax and fringe benefit tax that those opposite sometimes like to claim that they supported, when really John Howard couldn't even give support to consensus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conservatives fought Hawke every step of the way, and there's no greater example of this than Medicare. Hawke fought for Medicare because he knew that no society without universal health care could be a fair society, but he was resisted at every step. Before Hawke became leader, Labor had campaigned for universal health care in the 1969, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1977 and 1980 elections, and it had been opposed by conservatives at every turn. Whitlam's universal healthcare legislation was defeated three times by the conservatives in the Senate, and he was forced to call a double dissolution election to obtain the support of the parliament to pass the legislation creating Medicare in a joint sitting of parliament. Even then, at the first opportunity, when Whitlam lost government, the conservatives tore it up. This was the level of opposition that Hawke faced, but he overcame it. The conservatives continued to oppose his Medicare at the 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990 elections. But Hawke beat them at every turn and forced a change in the terms of debate, and, by 1996, the conservatives could not win an election in this country without repudiating their previous public opposition to Medicare. Hawke's leadership established a legacy that is the envy of the world: Medicare, a universal healthcare system that delivers better health outcomes at a lower cost than nearly any other country in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was a consensus leader, but, when he couldn't get consensus when it really mattered, he led by taking a stand. There are many Hawke achievements being celebrated here today, but I will always be personally thankful that, when John Howard said that too many people like my family, Chinese Australians, were coming to Australia, Bob Hawke's leadership stopped him dead. When in 1988 John Howard broke the consensus on a racially non-discriminatory immigration policy by calling for an open debate on levels of Asian migration to Australia and arguing that, in his view, it should be slowed down a little so that the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater, Hawke took a stand. In the first suspension of standing orders debate in this parliament, in this chamber, at the despatch box, Hawke called Howard to account. But he did so in a way that allowed consensus to be restored in the aftermath of the debate. Hawke told this House:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One of the great and rare distinctions of Australian political leadership in the last generation has been its bipartisan rejection of race as a factor in immigration policy. This has been a triumph of compassion over prejudice, of reason over fear, and of statesmanship over politics. Twenty-two years ago my Party, the Australian Labor Party, disowned its own historic white Australia policy, and the Government led by Harold Holt, to its everlasting credit and honour, abolished the white Australia policy and began to dismantle the administrative machinery of discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This motion is before this House today because that great and rare distinction has been put in jeopardy by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)—the inheritor of the role, but not the mantle, of Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Malcolm Fraser. I say this most sincerely to the Leader of the Opposition: this motion has not been brought forward in any attempt to drive him into the ground. It is not, because if he would retract his position then, as far as this side of the House is concerned, what has happened would be regarded as an aberration and would be forgotten. We would be pleased and proud to re-embrace once again an unqualified bipartisanship on this important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> So, even in this moment, when a politician sought to divide our country, to divide Australia, Bob Hawke sought to bring us together. He didn't want a Pyrrhic political victory; he wanted a win for the nation, a win that brought us all together again. In this regard, we can thank Bob Hawke not just for the legacy that he has left us but for the lessons that he continues to offer us today about how to move forward as a nation. I offer my condolences to everyone who knew Bob Hawke, to his family in particular, and offer my thanks from a grateful nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  It's an honour to speak today to farewell Labor giant Bob Hawke. Today I speak on behalf the Central Coast, one of many communities around the nation that embraced Bob Hawke as their leader. Last night I called my friend Michael Lee, the first member for Dobell and a Keating government minister, for his recollections of Prime Minister Hawke. Michael went way back to 1975, when the Florida Hotel in Terrigal was the backdrop for the Labor national conference. Then ALP President Bob Hawke drew attention for his relaxed attire—patterned speedos—and ended up shirtless in the stocks at Old Sydney Town. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday, 14 December 1986, Prime Minister Hawke officially opened the federally funded Mooney Mooney Creek Bridge, the main road link between Sydney, the Central Coast and the Hunter. Then New South Wales Premier Barry Unsworth quipped that it was a fine example of federalism in action—the federal government raised the money and the state government got to spend it. The replacement of the original Mooney Creek crossing with a four-lane cantilevered concrete structure was deemed an engineering feat at the time. It created a high-speed link between Sydney and Newcastle, opening up the Hunter and Central Coast regions. Thousands of people walked across the bridge that day. I'm told it was the biggest bridge opening in New South Wales since the Sydney Harbour Bridge opening. It was a huge celebration, and, as was often his wont, Prime Minister Hawke conducted the band that day. He also recognised the natural beauty of the Central Coast, remarking on that occasion, 'It was not just one of the most beautiful parts of Australia, but you could go just about anywhere in the world and you're not going to find anything much more beautiful than this.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that day, Prime Minister Hawke also opened the Lake Haven Recreation Centre, built as a community employment project, a job creation program in response to the recession of the early eighties, with the support of the then Wyong Shire Council. Many local kids, like me, grew up playing sport at Lake Haven. The Prime Minister was back on 10 April 1987 to officially open the HopeTown School in Wyong, my home town. I knew the first principal of HopeTown, Elaine Quilty, very well. HopeTown remains a thriving school community, dedicated to serving special education and individual student needs across the Central Coast. On Australia Day 1990, our larrikin Prime Minister arrived by helicopter and was welcomed by over 10,000 people at The Entrance Memorial Park, before hosting a barbecue at The Entrance surf lifesaving club—just another everyday example of his mutual love affair with the Australian people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The higher education reforms of the Hawke government also led to the establishment of the University of Newcastle Ourimbah campus, opened in 1995, the first university campus on the Central Coast of New South Wales. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke made many memorable visits to our region on the Central Coast. More importantly, the legacy of his reforms stays with our community. Regional communities around Australia, including the coast, were the main beneficiaries of many of the Hawke government's substantial reforms. His reintroduction of universal public health care in the form of Medicare was one of the most significant Hawke reforms for communities like the coast. As a pharmacist who worked for 20 years in health and 10 years at my local community hospital in Wyong, I've seen the benefits of this important social reform for our country. Before Medicare, working families on the coast either went without medical care or could be forced into poverty to pay for a hospital stay. Hawke's Medicare removed the financial burden and untethered the imperative to seek health care from the fear that going to hospital could push you towards bankruptcy.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawke's push to increase the number of children finishing high school was another of his reforms with a far-reaching impact on the Central Coast. As many have already remarked, in 1983 Australia's school completion rate was only 30 per cent. It was one of the lowest in the developed world. Eight years later the nation's school retention rate had climbed to 70 per cent. This focus on school retention meant that many young people in my community on the Central Coast during the eighties and the early nineties were the first in their families to complete high school, setting them on the path to a better life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure every region around Australia has its own special memories of the people's Prime Minister. I am honoured to have the opportunity to share just some of the Central Coast's memories here today. In closing, I would like to remember my late nanna Elaine, a life member of the Labor Party. I am wearing nanna's 1983 election pin today. She was a great supporter of Bob Hawke and one of the many everyday Australians who had a better life because of him. Thank you, and my condolences to everyone who knew Bob Hawke, from a grateful nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I, too, rise today to speak on the condolence motion for the Hon. Robert James Lee Hawke, one of the greatest prime ministers and Australians that this country has seen. Being a South Australian, I, and many of my colleagues in South Australia, like to claim Bob as one of our own. He was born in Bordertown, a little country town a couple of hundred kilometres out of Adelaide. Bob had some very humble beginnings; he was from a humble background. His father, who was a religious minister in Bordertown, was moved to Perth, and so Bob moved to Perth at a very young age. But, of course, Bordertown hasn't forgotten Bob Hawke. There is a big bust of Bob in the centre of the town, where people are reminded that that was his birthplace. The people of Bordertown are very proud of the former Prime Minister.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to hear, after Bob's death, the mayor of Bordertown talk about converting Bob's house into a Bob Hawke museum for people to visit. I'm not actually sure whether Bordertown is in the member for Barker's electorate—</span>

                  </a>  It is. I'd like to acknowledge the member for Barker, who's here as well. I'm sure he will have more to say on that, Bordertown being in his electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was someone who was loved by all Australians. He was a household name well before he entered parliament. I recall my parents, when I was young, talking about the ACTU leader of Australia and the many different battles that were taking place in industrial relations around that time—not only my parents; all their friends and everyone they were connected to knew the name Bob Hawke well before he entered parliament. He was a household name when he did enter parliament. He was someone who had a vision. He had a vision for Australia: to make it fairer and better for working people. We know that he did many things like floating the dollar, to give us a better edge in the global competition taking place, and the formation of APEC. Of course, there was the environment—for example, saving Antarctica and ensuring it was kept pristine. Landcare, which he introduced when he was Prime Minister, looking after the land and, of course, saving the Franklin River were all things under his auspices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He modernised Australia together with Keating. Together they worked in a partnership that was one of the best political partnerships that this country has seen. And, of course, each and every one of us, for a couple of generations now, has been carrying around a little green card in our wallets or back pockets—or it's somewhere in a drawer at home—which gives us the ability to visit any doctor and have a great universal healthcare system, which was introduced when he was the Prime Minister in 1983, after he had seen the dismantling of Medibank during Fraser's two terms of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Bob had a vision. He had a way of bringing people together. He was able to bring consensus and ensure that he brought people along. It wasn't just about dictating and saying what he wanted through his leadership vision; it was about bringing people together, getting them to understand and leading in a way that ensured that it promoted and gave fairness to all Australians. We saw some great things under his leadership. As I said, he modernised Australia. We ended up with Medicare, which we still revere today. He reformed the industrial relations and of course he also did a lot in immigration and multiculturalism. I recall him visiting the Greek orthodox community in South Australia—a huge event at Olympic Hall—after he had become Prime Minister and the joy on people's faces at having the Prime Minister of Australia visit this ethnic group that not many people prior had visited. In South Australia we were lucky: we did have Don Dunstan, and Whitlam did attend on a couple of occasions, but you could see Bob that day just walking around in a room of about 800 people, shaking hands, talking to everyone, smiling—and I think he even did a bit of Greek dancing when the festivities began that night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined the Labor Party soon after Bob Hawke became the Prime Minister. I was so enthused by Bob that I walked into a party office. I had no connection to the Australian Labor Party in any way. I didn't work for a trade union. In fact, I was driving taxis full time at that time. I had a keen interest in politics and was always on the Labor side of politics, but Bob inspired me so much that I walked into South Terrace and asked to join the Australian Labor Party a couple of days after he was elected Prime Minister. He was the type of person who would enthuse people and bring them along, as I said, when he was coming up with ideas and who wanted to lead the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some great things that he did. For example, there was assisting in the sanctions that saw apartheid end and the freeing of Nelson Mandela after all those years in jail. It was not just the Australian landscape that he changed but the international landscape as well. He visited Moscow in those years to open up trade and other things. He was someone that had a vision and someone that could see how he could better Australia through policy decision-making not just for the sake of bettering Australia but to ensure that he made it fairer and better for working-class people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at superannuation, the wealth creation for working people and something that we didn't have in this nation. Superannuation was for the few privileged prior to Bob Hawke. But he had a vision, together with Keating, to ensure that working people, when they retired, would have some form of wealth savings to be able to live in dignity and to be able to have those things that others had and things they aspired to. I know that, for example, one of the other great things was the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests. I know the former member for Hindmarsh, John Scott, who was the member back then, was lobbying Bob Hawke to look into this area, and we did. He oversaw the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests. It was established back in 1985, I think. It reported with many findings that were implemented and it also looked at the impact of traditional owners and the use of their lands. The commission reported on 5 December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was the handback of Uluru. We all remember Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen formally handing back to the Pitjantjatjara traditional owners the deeds and the titles, all under the auspices of one of the greatest Prime Ministers that we've had: Bob Hawke. I had him in the electorate on many occasions, Hindmarsh being a marginal seat—one of the most marginal back in the old seat that I had—and we had one of the largest call centres in the country. It was a Westpac call centre, which was located in Lockleys. Bob had some kind of connection to it after he had retired and had put in the offer to our campaign office to come in and do a walkthrough. There would have been, I think, about 600 people that worked in that call centre. It took us two hours to get out of there. He stopped and spoke to every single person—everyone that he could talk to and shake hands with—and it was not just a gesture but a real conversation with a lot of people, asking them about their work and about how the call centre was going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a great bloke. I remember meeting him soon after I'd won the seat. Even though he'd been to our electorate on a number of occasions, I thought I'd go up and say: 'Hi, Bob. It's Steve Georganas. I'm not sure if you remember me.' And he said: 'Of course I remember you. I won the seat for you.' This was the type of person he was. He was always joyous. He was always happy to have a chat and always willing to assist and help on campaigns and come out to do street walks with me, and he would be absolutely mobbed when we did. I remember doing a street walk in Jetty Road, Glenelg, where just about every person that was on the street would come up to us to say, 'Hello, Mr Hawke,' and just have a chat. He was a wonderful Prime Minister, a great Australian and a larrikin, and he'll be remembered by all and sorely missed by all of us. Our condolences go out to Blanche, his family and his kids.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I rise to support this condolence motion on the passing of Bob Hawke—larrikin, leader, legend, one of Australia's most loved sons, one of Labor's most revered figures and one of Australia's greatest prime ministers. In fact, he was Labor's and Australia's greatest peacetime Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke's life spanned almost a century. He was born in December 1929, at the start of the Great Depression, an economic catastrophe which inflicted immense hardship on the people of Australia. He died nine decades later, as Australia was enjoying the longest period of uninterrupted growth of any advanced economy, thanks to the reforms he introduced as Prime Minister. Over the span of Bob's life, the country experienced extraordinary events—wars and military conflicts, political crises, and economic booms and busts—and went through tremendous social, technological, cultural and political changes. From his early days as a trade union advocate to his time as Prime Minister and his later years as a Labor stalwart and elder statesman, Bob Hawke was at the centre of so many of these events and was responsible for so many of the changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The catalogue of his reforms, the list of his achievements, is long and it is far reaching: modernising and internationalising the Australian economy, unlocking its potential and underwriting three decades of prosperity; reorienting the nation from its past as a far-flung part of the British Empire to its future as a confident, outward-looking nation playing a leading role in the Asia-Pacific region; building the Australian social safety net, from Medicare to occupational superannuation and from fair wages and working conditions to accessible higher education; and creating a tolerant, open and diverse society through equal rights for women, support for a multicultural community, human rights and antidiscrimination legislation, and starting the process of reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. Other speakers in this House have reflected on these reforms in more detail. I want to reflect on the fact that many people have been claiming the legacy of Bob Hawke, but most of these reforms were not bipartisan, I'm sad to say. Many of them were hard fought and were only secured through great political skill and courage and cemented through winning four elections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd now like to focus briefly on an aspect of the Hawke legacy which is sometimes overlooked, and that's his role in building an independent Australian defence and strategic posture. Under Bob Hawke's prime ministership, the then defence minister, Kim Beazley, conducted a far-reaching review of Australia's defence structure and capabilities. This led to the Hawke government's seminal 1987 white paper entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The defence of Australia</span>. The white paper laid out a fundamental strategic objective of defence self-reliance within the framework of the ANZUS alliance and Australia's regional associations. It also developed the strategic concept of defence in depth and, as Allan Gyngell has written, made the case for a more regionally engaged Australian focus on South-East Asia and the South Pacific. The Hawke government also commissioned the Cooksey review of defence industry, which resulted in reforms to improve Australian industry capabilities and alignment with strategic defence planning. This was seminal work that represented a break with the past in terms of Australia's defence planning and was another great legacy of the Hawke government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one I'd like to mention briefly is his recognition of building political support for economic reforms. Bob understood that to make difficult reforms like dismantling protectionism, restructuring industries and opening up the economy he had to bring the workforce along. Intrinsic to this was his empathy with working people. This allowed him to articulate and explain the economic reforms and to work in partnership with the unions, the workforce and the wider community in implementing and delivering this reform. This was vital. To be fair, and without any disrespect, the stance of the opposition of the day on tariff reforms, on industry restructuring, didn't matter; what mattered was the attitude of the workforce, because ultimately they were the ones who bore the pain of this very necessary structural adjustment. The legacy and the signature approach of Bob Hawke in building consensus and taking the workforce and unions along were essential in carrying forward these reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke's presence in modern Australia went beyond the many important achievements and historic reforms. With his gregarious personality, his irreverent wit, his sharp intelligence and his passionate and generous spirit, he embodied and personified the Australian character. Bob has been a huge inspiration in my own political development, as he has been for almost every member on this side of the parliament. I was lucky enough to first meet Bob in 1986 when he came to open the Mooney Mooney Bridge on the Pacific Highway on the New South Wales Central Coast. Anyone who drives the Pacific Motorway knows the Mooney Mooney Bridge, the 'big dipper'. My parents were staunch Labor supporters and took me to the event. I was seven years old. I was standing on the bridge and I was thrilled to get the Prime Minister's autograph.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that Bob has passed, I wish to extend my condolences to Blanche, Susan, Stephen, Rosslyn, Louis and the rest of Bob's family and friends, and acknowledge the role of the late Hazel Hawke. The nation has lost a leader, a reformer, a statesman and a great citizen. His family have lost a husband, a father, a grandfather and a loved one. We thank them for the support they gave to allow Bob to make such a contribution to the public life of this nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first became aware of Bob Hawke's presence before he was Prime Minister. My father was at the time president of the ironworkers union in Newcastle, and Bob Hawke was no stranger to the workers of Newcastle and steel industry workers in particular. In those days, the ironworkers union used to invest quite a bit of time and energy into training delegates in the various industries. I remember my father convening a delegates meeting with men—and they were all men—from BHP and Lysaghts and Stewarts &amp; Lloyds and other big companies that no longer exist in Newcastle. Bob Hawke was to spend 10 minutes with the delegates in this training session while he was in Newcastle doing a number of other things in his capacity as President of the ACTU. In typical fashion, that 10 minutes stretched into about an hour and a half by the time he managed to speak to each and every one of those delegates and give them renewed dedication and inspiration for the significance of the labour movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague the member for Shortland mentioned, Bob understood, perhaps more than most, the need to build political and community alliances when you were to undergo major social and economic reform in this nation. And that is of course what Bob was always doing. That's why he always had time for people. Regardless of the position he held, and regardless of any number of minders and advisers around him trying to convince him of the need to keep to certain schedules and times, Bob would always have time to stop and listen. He would listen quite intently to people's stories—what their passions were and what drove them. And that of course made him such a unique leader in the Australian political landscape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of other things I'd just like to touch on in the very limited time available tonight—the things that I grew to really love about Bob Hawke. He was a risk taker, and he knew precisely the times when he had to take those big risks. I was really privileged not that long ago to spend some time with Mr Bill Bowtell, who was at one time a health adviser to Neal Blewett in the Hawke government. He talked to me about how they first dealt with the HIV/AIDS epidemic as it was unfolding in Australia, when we knew very little about this virus. He went to then Prime Minister Bob Hawke and said: 'You know, I'm going to need your permission to offend probably every single group in Australia and take on every vested interest. I'm going to need to be able to talk about IV drug use, prostitution, anal sex, gay/lesbian culture, and we need to tackle this front on.' Bob, to his great credit—understanding full well in the 1980s that that meant taking on the church, the police, the medical profession and indeed the media—knew what was right and he had the courage to take the risk and say: 'This is a public health epidemic. That's what we need to do.' And he gave his health minister and advisers licence to then lead the world in dealing with what was an unbelievable epidemic at the time. It's hard to imagine whether a Prime Minister would have had the courage today to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge with thanks Bob's total rejection of racism and prejudice in this nation. That is something that lives with me and with, I know, so many members—especially on this side of the House but certainly not exclusively. I was a young anthropologist working in the field when Bob was Prime Minister and remember his instrumental commitment to redressing the relationship that existed with First Nations people and subsequent settlers in this nation. Many, many years ago—some 30 years ago now—we had the first Barunga Statement, which we have here in parliament hanging near the Members Hall. It was such a radical document at the time, yet today we have failed to deliver consistently on the requests of that Barunga Statement. Along with Senators Pat Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy, Linda Burney, Bill Shorten and the member for Brand, last year I attended the Barunga Festival, 30 years after the statement was presented to Bob Hawke. It was sad that the promise of a treaty all those decades ago remains elusive in Australia. We have failed to really come to terms with how we now seek redress to the 230-year colonial relationship. But the lesson I took from that Barunga Festival last year, 30 years down the track, and from Bob's passing on 16 May is the need to redouble our efforts now. It is incumbent on all of us who sit in this chamber to do everything we can to realise his commitments and his honours and his promises to First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd finally like to acknowledge Bob's family. I had the pleasure of working alongside Steve Hawke over a number of years in Fitzroy Crossing. Steve's mum and Bob's first wife, Hazel, was a frequent visitor to Fitzroy Crossing too. I send my sincere condolences to Steve, to Ros, to Sue, who went on to do such magnificent work with Hazel around dementia later on, and of course to Bob's later life companion, Blanche.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Bob, for your vision, for your courage, for your compassion, for your steadfast commitment to bringing Australians together, for always saying no to racism and division and for the leadership role you took in reforming Australia to ensure we were a better nation. We know that you loved Australia, and we certainly loved you too. Vale Bob Hawke.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="159771" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I joined the Labor Party in early 1990, around the time of the federal election that year. It was the first time I had voted, and I enthusiastically voted for the sitting Labor member for Greenway in order for Bob Hawke to remain Prime Minister. It was of course Bob Hawke's fourth and final election victory, and he would go out undefeated at the polls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My greatest appreciation of Bob Hawke is that he was the ultimate marginal seat campaigner—the seats and the messaging in elections where they are won and lost. Don't get me wrong: he would feel just at home in a safe seat held by any party or any individual. But something I maintain that only those of us who have to fight for every vote to win their seat to get here and to stay here truly understand is that it's about the constant effort to build and strengthen relationships with people, to not take anyone for granted and to prove yourself with everyone. How do you do that these days, to connect with 100,000 voters who live in an electorate like mine in Greenway, who are so diverse in every aspect, from age to ethnic background, to religion, to income? I've come to appreciate more than ever in reflecting on Bob Hawke that how you engage with people can be just as important and sometimes more relevant in the eyes of voters than your party's actual policies. For Bob Hawke it was always about relationships. The lesson of Bob Hawke is that he was so approachable. He loved meeting people. He was authentic. He didn't talk down to people, but he didn't dumb himself down either. He was a man of incredible intellect and status but, rather than begrudge him because of it, Australians respected him because of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People I know who were around him during government stressed his incredible work ethic. By the time of the 1990 election he was around 60 years old, but he was incredibly fit and motivated and his campaign schedule was punishing. And, as he got older, he never stopped campaigning for the Labor Party, for Labor candidates and for sitting Labor MPs. In 2010, when I was running for the first time, he came out to Blacktown and did a walk through at Westpoint Shopping Centre, Blacktown. Just like everyone else has said in their remarks, he was utterly mobbed by everyone. It didn't matter their age or their background, everyone wanted a piece of him. It was like they were touching someone holy. He never lost that aura, and he was so generous in being ready to campaign for the Labor cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, when it was hard to find friends, he still came out to Blacktown and, speaking to Labor supporters and motivating them just before campaign day, he said something I will never forget. He rattled off all the arguments he knew our opponents would make going into that election and he encouraged everyone to arm themselves with the facts: 'Here are the facts about the Labor mission and what Labor has done to bring Australia to this point of its economic prosperity.' This was well before fake news was a thing. He told everyone to arm themselves with the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke had every attribute to ensure that over time he set the standard. Indeed, in 1980, the Labor campaign slogan was 'Raise the Standard'. This was an election that Labor did not win—did very well but did not win—and it was the election where he entered parliament. I have a poster that takes pride of place in my office featuring Bob Hawke with Lionel Bowen, Bill Hayden and Neville Wran—giants of the labour movement. I had to remind myself that, although he was being featured heavily in this campaign, he was actually entering parliament for the first time. How unprecedented was that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This guy was actually a candidate and he was being featured alongside the great leaders of the Labor Party. I never really appreciated what 'raise the standard' meant until I thought about how this was about taking Australia and saying: 'We are a very lucky country, but we need to make ourselves better. Australia is good, but we need to be making ourselves better.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, we as Labor people are often approached by punters who will make the remark that Labor have never had a leader since like Bob Hawke and that we will never have the kind of messiah quality that Bob Hawke had again. If we are going to just accept that as a fact then the Labor mission is hollow. I know what Bob Hawke would have said, just as I'm sure you do, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon. Instead of just accepting that as fact, he would be turning on the three lessons I have outlined here: the importance of connecting with everyone, the importance of arming yourself with the facts to have quality debate on the issues that matter and, just as Bob Hawke said, the importance for us in Labor to always be raising the standard, to never accept the status quo and to never accept that near enough is good enough. They are the lessons that I take from Bob Hawke. I'm grateful, just as I know all of us in Labor are, for his life and his service to our country and to our movement.</span>

                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I have a very personal reason to revere the memory of Bob Hawke. Bob and his deputy, Paul Keating, in their governments, provided the framework for the modern, multicultural and dynamic society we have today. Bob Hawke's achievements were many. My colleagues have spoken of his many, many achievements and the many things he provided for Australian society to make it a better place. Environmental reforms, education reforms and the concept of the accord and a social wage were very, very important. The Hawke team had many people of high achievement and high ability, but Hawke brought them all together and allowed each to use their skills for the benefit of all Australians. As we've heard on numerous occasions, Bob Hawke had charm, sex appeal and charisma. Above all else, however, he had a huge intellect and huge courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I started my private paediatric practice in February 1984, the same month and year that Medicare was introduced to the Australian public. I have been forever grateful. I'd seen, as a medical student, resident, registrar and fellow, how many people struggled to access health care, particularly high-level care, and how many families feared health challenges, not because of the physical effects but because of the financial challenges. Inability to pay healthcare costs was a common cause of bankruptcy and family breakdown. The reintroduction of a universal health insurance scheme dramatically changed access to health care for millions of Australians. I, more than many in this place, have had a very personal reason to be grateful. Medicare formed the backbone of my medical career for over 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke's introduction of Medicare was a huge social change, but it wasn't easy. Some on the other side are very fond of trying to rewrite history about this. I remember every day of that campaign. I remember the bitterness. I remember the huge intimidation that was attempted by conservative politicians and conservative doctors. Indeed, my own organisation, the AMA, of which I've been a member for over 40 years, under Bruce Shepherd fought tooth and nail, with the connivance of conservative politicians, to stop the introduction of the universal healthcare scheme that we are so grateful for today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember that time very, very well. Ever since, I've been grateful for Bob Hawke's courage. And, remember, it took a lot of courage. This was a time of financial instability. The Australian economy was stressed. There were lots of other stresses. But Bob Hawke stood firm. It was on the back of a lot of work by people like Ralph Willis and Neal Blewett and by the original proponents of a universal healthcare scheme, such as Dick Scott and John Deeble. But it required enormous courage to push this through, and what a benefit it has been. It has kept our healthcare costs much lower than in comparable developed countries. It has provided access, and equitable access, to health care for so many millions of people. I've been forever grateful because it provided me with a very stable and very financially successful private practice in paediatrics. We should also remember the role of Bill Hayden, Bob Hawke's predecessor as the leader of the parliamentary Labor Party for his role in this. I want to make the point very strongly, though, that it took a lot of courage on the part of Bob Hawke. It would've been so easy for him to back down under that pressure. We should all be so grateful for that. I remember the intimidation and I remember how much pressure was put on Hawke and his government to back down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to mention—it has been mentioned previously—the role that Bob Hawke and Neal Blewett had in combating HIV. 1984 was also the time when the HIV virus was first beginning to be described. It took a lot of courage to run that dramatically successful campaign of HIV education in the eighties that really saved the lives of many Australians. We should also be very grateful for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to take any longer, but I remember Bob Hawke so fondly not only for Medicare but for his other innovative health policies. Others have spoken so much on his other achievements. I'd like to offer my personal condolences to his wife, Blanche, and his family, including his children and grandchildren. It's been a great privilege for me to speak today on the condolence motion for Bob Hawke, a great Australian. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="74519" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  Robert James Lee Hawke was Prime Minister for the first seven years of my life. He was just 11 days into his second term when I was born. I am so grateful to have grown up in Bob Hawke's Australia. Indeed, I grew up in Fremantle, which itself was transformed by the hosting of the America's Cup in 1987.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke and Labor's winning of the 1984 election was in large part due to Medicare. I'm so thankful that they did. It was that universal health system that Bob Hawke built that helped me, as an asthmatic child, be healthy, fit and here today. Equally, Medicare allowed my parents—both teachers on average wages—to worry about my health, not their bank balance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Though Bob was born in South Australia to Clem and Ellie, it's no surprise that Western Australians claim Bob as one of their favourite sons. Bob spent his formative years in West Leederville, then in the electorate of Fremantle and held by his hero, John Curtin. He attended Perth Modern School in the middle of World War II. It's no surprise that there he enrolled in army cadets. Indeed, the community of Perth Modern remembers his contribution at that time in digging trenches at the school as part of that cadet training. Later he enjoyed the wonders of university life at the University of Western Australia. We thank Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia for their contribution to giving us that great Labor Prime Minister. Bob became guild president of the University of Western Australia in 1951. I know that because every guild president from the University of Western Australia I have ever met tells you very proudly, 'You know, Bob Hawke was guild president'—wink, wink, nudge, nudge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1953 he graduated, and in 1953 his uncle Bert Hawke became Labor Premier of Western Australia. Bert Hawke's compassion for Aboriginal Western Australians and his commitment to raising school leaving ages and to the practical alleviation of poverty was clearly an inspiration to his nephew. It was also on the streets of Perth where Bob crashed his Panther motorcycle. The accident left him drifting between life and death. His parents worried they would lose another son. Western Australia did help form the Prime Minister that we have been celebrating in this place today. Western Australia also gave him the much-loved Hazel and helped bring into the world his children. I think it's been great to hear the tributes to Hazel as well today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As union leader and then president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, he brought people together. He reformed the Labor movement. As Western Australians, we loved him, and we showed that at the 1983 election. That adoration shone through. He won eight out of 11 seats in Western Australia, something the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party could only dream of today. There was an average swing of almost nine per cent across the state. It was at that election that Labor regained the seat of Perth, which we have now held for the last 35 or so years. On election night, when the results came in, it became apparent that the Hawke government had not just won but had won in a landslide, with 24 seats gained—the largest defeat of a sitting government in more than 30 years. Because of that election, more children than ever finished their schooling, health care was finally accessible to all and the nation benefited from both real and social wage increases. Women's rights, economic participation, reconciliation with our First Peoples, regional economic engagement and environmental protection—we've spent the day celebrating all of those achievements. His 1983 campaign slogan, 'Bringing Australia together', defined his character and the entire time he served as Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After his time as Prime Minister, he continued to campaign. He loved campaigning and he loved advocating the cause of Labor. I saw that up close in March 2017 as campaign director for the WA Labor Party. Five days out from the election, Bob was our final secret weapon. We had him come to endorse Mark McGowan at the Perth Town Hall, and he did so. I think he was really there to endorse Bob Hawke, but nonetheless he did help us with a historic election win. The night before, I had the privilege of dining with him; Mark McGowan; my wife, Jess; and the members for Brand, Burt and Fremantle amongst others at the Kent Street Deli in Rockingham. I'm almost certain that was the only time Bob would have ever gone to the Kent Street Deli in Rockingham. It was a great night. He was in great spirits, telling jokes I could not repeat in this place or anywhere, and also complaining that we hadn't given him enough campaigning to do. I want to thank Gary Gray for organising that dinner. That was my last meaningful engagement with Bob, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the Prime Minister for his announcement of the scholarship to honour the Hawke legacy. I think that's a really touching and meaningful announcement that he made this morning. In the same vein, I want to note the commitment that next year in Subiaco, in Western Australia, Bob Hawke College will open. Many young Australians from my electorate will complete their schooling years at Bob Hawke College. It won't be just a great school; it will carry on Bob's legacy. It will carry on his belief that education really can transform a child's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pass on my sincerest condolences to Blanche, the Hawke family, all of Bob's former staff, Jill Saunders and everyone in Australia who loved him and had a relationship with him, whether they knew him or not. In solidarity forever, vale Bob Hawke.</span>

                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  Bob Hawke: a political giant, a great union man, a great Labor man, a great Australian, a great Prime Minister. I join today with my parliamentary colleagues to mourn the loss and celebrate the life and contributions of Bob Hawke in this place and beyond these walls. Through his service, his great friendship with Paul Keating and his belief in his gifted cabinet, Bob Hawke created modern Australia. We are all indebted to his leadership for the social and economic progress that he led as our 23rd Prime Minister. We've heard today the list of the social, environmental and economic policies that are now accepted practice. We can't imagine Australia without them. I'll not go on and list them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke steered our country through dramatic change, and it is this that is remarkable. He did it with an understanding of leadership. He proudly served our nation with courage and conviction, as has been attested to today, but for me what was most important was his understanding of change and of what needed to be done to ensure change was not rejected by the Australian people but embraced. He allowed his authority to grow in government. He knew that change was dramatic. He knew that if fear of change took over he would not be able to deliver. He wove, therefore, a story of hope; he seduced us. As a result, people let him lead. We let him dream and we let him deliver. He earned the trust of the Australian people and, in turn, implemented change to progress their interests. He let the people into his thinking. He used his wit. He made us laugh. He and Keating took Australianness into this chamber. They were irreverent. Hawke took this irreverence, his larrikinism, to the world stage unashamedly, and we loved it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in Victoria under Liberal governments. My first political memory was the sacking of Gough Whitlam, so before Bob Hawke I'd never really seen consciously a federal Labor government. I hadn't seen a state Labor government. In my early 20s I voted for Barry Jones in the seat that I now proudly represent, and of course he went into Bob Hawke's cabinet. It was the first time in my short voting record that my vote was for the party that would ultimately form government—a Hawke government. As a student studying at The University of Melbourne, I joined thousands of fellow students in protesting against the Fraser government and its intent that would see the most vulnerable in our community suffer. In those protests we played our small part in delivering the Hawke government. When I was thinking about this yesterday, I noted that our former Prime Minister Julia Gillard was marching in the streets of Adelaide at the same time. Of course, Julia went on to become the member for Lalor and a great prime minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That Hawke government, under Bob's urging, wisely built social policy to support people while he asked them to trust his government to make radical economic change. His optimism about who we were and who we could be shaped a generation. He taught us that we were a country where by working together we could overcome intransigence and we could become a country less judgemental and more forgiving and embracing, where individual contributions would be valued and celebrated, where we were proud of our unique voice, our unique vision and our unique unfinished story, and we celebrated that in the Australian film industry at the time. He taught us that we could see reconciliation with our First Peoples on the horizon, and all we had to do was reach for it. Our larrikin PM who put aside our old judgemental selves and our hypercritical past and embraced our own Australianness defined us as a nation. We wanted to be better and we wanted to do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a saying in drama and in writing: don't tell them; show them. That's what Bob did. He showed us what pride looked like, what love for country looked like and what a fair society looked like. Bob leaves our country and the Australian Labor Party a formidable legacy to defend and live up to, and I will join my colleagues every day to do that. He made us proud to be ourselves. He made us proud of our achievements. He made us feel like winners. From the song he loved to sing come the lines:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We have laid the wide foundations, built it skyward stone by stone </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob taught us how to live this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My deepest condolences and thanks go to Bob's family for sharing him with us. And, please, know that fewer children lived in poverty because of Bob, more children got opportunity because of Bob, swathes of our environment are still protected because of Bob and families no longer had to make a monetary choice to see a doctor because of Bob. Vale Bob, from a grateful Australia. Solidarity forever.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  No-one could sing 'Solidarity Forever' like Bob Hawke. Many of us on this side of the chamber can remember this from going to an ACTU event or a Labor event. It didn't matter who spoke that night or that day. In the moment when Bob stood up and sang 'Solidarity Forever', he was the star of the show. There was an ACTU dinner one year where we recognised Bill Kelty for his fantastic contribution. He spoke, as Bill does, for quite some time about the great challenge for the labour movement and the great challenge for Labor. Paul Keating also spoke and, again, spoke for a very long time, as Paul is known to do, about the great challenge for the labour movement and the great challenge for Labor. Like always, it was Bob who stole the show with the way he sang 'Solidarity Forever', the way it lifts the room up and the way in which it reminded all of us of the hope, the aspiration and the solidarity that he had and lived each and every day of his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob, as we have heard today, influenced many, particularly on my side of politics. He had a way of connecting with people that really made them feel included and inspired. My electorate of Bendigo had the great privilege and pleasure to meet with Bob on many occasions. When Bob became Prime Minister, John Brumby was the federal member for Bendigo. He held the seat for a number of years. Back then and still today, Bendigo is considered a marginal seat. Bob visited Bendigo many times. On his passing during the election campaign, I was stopped many times at early voting centres with people telling me their story of Bob, such as Bob walking down Hargreaves Mall and just stopping to have a yarn and chat. People would be saying: 'My God, there goes Bob Hawke. He just spoke to me. Bob Hawke spoke to me.' It would be talked about for weeks on end when he visited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fabian Reid, the former chief of staff to John Brumby, refers to Bob Hawke's visits to Bendigo as being like a 'visit from a rock star'. He said they just had to mention it to one person and, before you knew it, thousands knew about it. He recalled ALP members falling over themselves to host events at their own houses and at their own workplaces. From the moment they heard that Bob was coming to town, it was hard to turn people away and it was hard to say no, because everybody wanted to meet Bob and to host Bob. Fundraisers that were sometimes supposed to be small gatherings—you might invite local businesses along or local health and community leaders along—turned into bigger events once you mentioned that Bob Hawke was coming. Fabian recalled one fundraiser where they were struggling to get numbers. It was close to the election. Bob agreed to come, and it sold out within minutes. It's that kind of influence that he had, particularly in regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He visited Bendigo on a number of occasions. He drew big crowds, but he also went to our smaller towns in the region. He didn't miss an opportunity to engage with everyone. He spent time in Maldon, and he spent time in Castlemaine. When the seat went north to what we would call 'Tiger country', he also ventured north. His ability to connect with people in the regions was just as strong. Even though our primary vote in some of these areas was as little as 20 per cent, it was like they forgot for a moment that they might not have been Labor inclined. That was because Bob was in town. They really connected with his values, with his ideas and with him because he was Prime Minister. It is has often been reflected in Bendigo that we haven't had a Prime Minister since Bob Hawke spending so much time in our electorate. He really understood the regions and spent the time there. John Brumby would probably say that it was because he was a great advocate. But it was more the fact that Bob really understood that if you really want to represent the people you need to know the people and you need to be on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his prime ministership, as we know, a lot of his key reforms really did help the people of my electorate. Today we're going through our own Medicare crisis. The doctors, once again, have closed their books. We have a shortage of GPs. That's largely because of what is happening to Medicare and Medicare payments. They're losing their bulk-billing incentives because Bendigo has been removed from the regional districts of workforce shortage list, and having to charge gap fees means they lose bulk-billing payments that are incurred with that. People are paying more and more today than they ever have to access GP services—if they can get into a GP. With the passing of Bob, we're reminded that we need to continue the campaign at a local level to ensure that Medicare survives, that we see the investment that's required to ensure that, regardless of where they live, no kid, no grandparent, no pensioner, no worker is denied access to a GP when they need one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember one person telling me a story, and he said: 'Look, it must've been after he was no longer Prime Minister, because Bob still made trips to Bendigo to support candidates. We were walking down the street and we were having a bit of a party, and we said: "Oi, Bob! You want a beer?" And he said, "Yes, I'd love one mate!"' This person was reflecting on it, saying, 'It must've been after he was Prime Minister, because I'm pretty sure he didn't drink while he was Prime Minister.' I think that was the strength of Bob: he continued to campaign in the same way after he was no longer Prime Minister as he did before he was Prime Minister and while he was Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had some great advice for all of us new MPs in 2013. Many of my colleagues here will remember the dinner we had where we all got the opportunity to meet Bob. I was really keen to talk to Bob about apartheid, his meeting Nelson Mandela and the other great things he had done in his career. The first thing he said to me was: 'Bendigo; that's a tough seat for us. Are you doing your street stalls? Doorknocking's important.' He wanted to make sure that I was doing the work on the ground that I needed to do to continue to be the federal member for Bendigo. 'All politics is local,' he said. That's something that John Brumby also said to me, after I was preselected. And he said, 'They're not my words, they're Bob's words.' So Bob has continued to have an influence on the generations of candidates that have come through since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another person who wanted to share their story about Bob talked about the time when he tried to come to Bendigo—well, he did come to Bendigo, but he was delayed because of a broken-down tram. He was stuck for two hours. There was this big crowd waiting for Bob, but people didn't disappear; the crowd just kept growing. 'He's going to get here. He'll be here.' The story in the media ended up being about Bob Hawke and the broken-down tram, telling the story about why he was late. But the real story should've been that an event that was supposed to have 50 people ended up having 500 people because during the two-hour delay more people found out he was on his way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big things that many of us also reflected on, particularly people of my generation—I confess that I just fit into gen Y—is that Bob Hawke is the first Prime Minister we can remember as kids. We fondly remember the leadership he took around Tiananmen Square as part of those early political memories that kids have. To be at primary school, to be at secondary school and to see the leadership that he took on a lot of social reforms, those are things you value and learn from, as children and as young adults, and reflect upon later in life. He brought so much of value to the role of Prime Minister and to our country. He didn't compromise on racism, he didn't compromise on equality, and he consistently campaigned to ensure that was at the forefront of all he did—even when it was considered unpopular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to make a few remarks on his role in the great trade union movement. It is a hard role to be the secretary, to be the president, to be an official of the ACTU at any time—just ask today's leaders—particularly when you have a dogged government that is going after your ability to organise and your ability to represent workers. But he stood up to that and always spoke to the value of representation, and to the value of workers having a say in their workplace, to justice and fairness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those skills that he had in the ACTU really saw the elevation of the union movement and of the ACTU. He is, and continues to be, a much-loved figure of the union movement because he managed to do what so many others before and after have not been able to do: be a true Labor leader and a Labor union leader, bring those values of unionism into this place and encourage all Australians to embrace them. Never did he waver from that conviction. Never did he say or believe or advocate that 'union' was a dirty word, that we needed to look at the role that unions played in modern Australia. And we all remember one of the first acts he did as Prime Minister was to bring unions and industry together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there are mixed views about the role of the accord and what that did for working people in Australia. There are some people in the union movement who said that unions became lazy once the accord came in. Maybe it wasn't the best strategic move. But what I recall, and what a lot of workers recall, is that it gave them a decent wage. It give working people—cleaners, security guards, people in award based industries—a decent pay and it gave them regular pay rises and the opportunity to start to organise and to build respect in their workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has so many lasting values and legacies that all of us will remember, but, for the people of Bendigo, it's his character that people reflect on the most: the fact that he made politics and parliament inclusive; the fact that he was willing to walk down the mall, have a chat, share a story; the fact that he could inspire people just by a conversation. He took the time to go to Maldon. He took the time to go to Castlemaine. Like no other Prime Minister before and after, he really did speak up and care for people in the regions, particularly the people in Bendigo.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I'm very glad to have the opportunity to reflect with gratitude and celebration on the life of Bob Hawke. He was without doubt one of the great Australian Prime Ministers and the greatest in my lifetime. He was a distinctively Labor Prime Minister, which means he knew the foundational importance of the things we share: fair pay and working conditions, high-quality public health and education, a comprehensive social safety net, the beauty and biodiversity of our environment, and our egalitarian and multicultural way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in year 7 at South Terrace Primary School in Freo when the Hawke government was elected, and at the end of that year Australia won the America's Cup, which was particularly momentous for my home town of Fremantle. 1983 was in many ways the birth of my political consciousness. The Hawke government showed me and many others what could be achieved through politics and what a difference a good government could make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in this debate we've been reminded of the staggering list of reforms delivered by Bob Hawke as Prime Minister. If I had to choose a policy to single out, it would be the family allowance reforms that provided better support for low-income and single-parent households, and in so doing made an enormous difference to millions of families—including mine. In the period 1980 to 1994, financial assistance for low-income families in Australia increased from being 60 per cent of the OECD average in 1980 to being 140 per cent of the OECD average in 1994. That is a massive leap, and I have no doubt that other transformative achievements like those in the area of educational opportunity and attainment were to some degree built on the family allowance reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all else, Bob Hawke and the government he led turned the wheel when it came to inequality and disadvantage in this country. He turned the wheel through the architecture of an inclusive economy and through massive improvements in our social compact, in public health, in education and in welfare support. It is well past time for us all to put our shoulder to that wheel again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I only met Bob Hawke a few times, but he was one of those people who communicated his nature and his temperament in that first contact. He was fundamentally affable and generous, good natured and good humoured. He looked you in the eye, he called you by your name and he grinned. I can remember that in the 2007 election campaign we organised a walk-through of the Phoenix Shopping Centre in the suburb of Spearwood for Bob and the then candidate for Fremantle, Melissa Parke. On the day the time was pushed back to be mid-morning. It was a weekday. We were concerned that there wouldn't be much of a crowd and it might not do justice to his time and effort. Someone suggested to Bob that perhaps we could just do a photo and have a coffee in a local coffee shop. But, characteristically, he was having none of that. He insisted that we go through the shopping centre. Like the storm that he was, he left us all in his wake. He reached out and shook hands with every person in the place. There seemed to be a kind of electric charge that drew people into his aura and spun them off to one side as he passed through. I remember a young bloke, slightly dazzled, took me by the arm and said, 'Who was that?' He didn't know it, but he had just had the Bob Hawke experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, before the WA state election, Bob came across to campaign with Mark McGowan, as the member for Perth mentioned earlier. A dinner was organised in Rockingham. I was very fortunate to attend with the member for Brand, among others. That night Bob told one of the jokes that he is famous for. Three people from different nations—a Frenchman, a Pom and an Australian, of course—are captured by a local tribe, which intends to punish their trespass with death. The head of the tribe offers the captives a choice between taking matters into their own hands or being put to a ritual death that will culminate in their skin being made into a canoe. In telling the joke Bob did the accents, which, you will all be glad to know, I'm not going to do. The French bloke and the Englishman, one after the other, asked for a knife and proceeded to do the deed after expressing some noble sentiments—God save the Queen; vive la France and so on. When it gets to the Australian's turn, he asks for a fork. He proceeds to prod himself up and down methodically, all over his body. Then he says, 'So much for your bloody canoe!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone laughed. A lot of the people there had heard that joke a few times from Bob. They still laughed. Bob himself laughed, before he had finished telling the joke and once he had finished telling the joke. One thing we know about Bob Hawke is that he loved to share his voice in joy and good humour and camaraderie. But he also had the courage to raise his voice and make an argument to make some noise in the cause of change, in the cause of difficult but necessary reform, in the cause of social and economic justice. Those twin capacities to bond and lift the spirits of his fellow Australians on the one hand and to lead and change for the better the way we live together in this country on the other make him remarkable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Fremantle community, I offer sincere condolences to Blanche and Bob's family and to his many, many friends. As others have described so well in this debate, the legacy of the Hawke government reaches deep and wide into Australian life today. It's a legacy that has shaped and should continue to shape contemporary Australia, but the ripples have already travelled over a lot of water by now. The passing of Bob Hawke is an opportunity for us to remember that for us to be the custodians of his legacy we must not shirk the hard yakka of fighting for change, for building consensus and for making it last.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  It's a real pleasure to rise in this debate to join in the celebration of the life of one of Australia's greatest ever prime ministers, Bob Hawke. To Bob's family and Blanche, we feel Bob's loss as a party, as a nation and as a people. I would like to add my condolences and those of my husband, Troy, to the family and friends of Bob Hawke. We know he is so sadly missed and we offer our sincerest condolences. I extend those also on behalf of the people of Griffith. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob's capacity to connect with and to deliver for Australians was unrivalled. He was a Rhodes scholar, a punter, a beer-sculling intellectual, a union leader, a friend of business and workers, a Prime Minister and a great economic and social policy architect. He shaped much of modern Australia. He was a great egalitarian, and he imbued these values into the Australian psyche more than any other political leader. He knew the value of listening to Australians, respecting their views and bringing them along on the reform journey that is the foundation of Australia's amazing 28 years of continuous economic growth. It's economic growth based on fairness. It's lifted Australian living standards to among the highest in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob knew the economy must work first and foremost for Australian families. High-paying jobs, better skills and highly educated, healthy and prosperous Australian families were at the forefront of an unprecedented period of change in the international economy. The developed economies of the world were going through a period that nobody really knew how to deal with—that was, stagflation. We had high inflation and high unemployment. Conservative governments around the world sought to deal with that through deregulation and union busting. But not Bob. Bob saw an opportunity for collaboration with the union movement. That's how we got the Prices and Incomes Accord. It was that economic foresight and willingness to work together in a consensus-building way—not to union bust and deregulate but to come up with the Prices and Incomes Accord—that really broke the back of inflation in this country, the major pressing economic challenge of the early 1980s and beyond. He did that because he knew the importance of strong wages and fair industrial laws in building the economic success of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, I think, the lesson from the Hawke and Keating era, from all sides of politics, was that you don't just magically stumble across economic success as a nation. Opening our economy up to the world, delivering Medicare, lifting school retention rates, boosting higher education access and success rates, skilling our next generation for trades linked to jobs in our economy, giving people dignity in retirement through our world-class retirement income system—all of these elements were crucial to our success as a nation. They are all part of the Hawke-Keating economic legacy and Australia's economic architecture, which we should never forget and we should never allow to be eroded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention Bob's impact in my home state of Queensland and on the people of Griffith, because it was tremendous. Prior to his prime ministership, only about 40 per cent of the Queenslanders completed year 12 but, by the end of his prime ministership, it was up to 85 per cent of Queenslanders finishing school. I'm in that statistic. My parents went to grade 10, as was very common at the time. It was rare in my home town of Cairns to go past grade 10. But one generation later, my sister and I both finished grade 12 and we both went to university. It was a quantum leap in one generation and it was because of Labor's work in education under Bob Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke was also one of the great environmental reformers of our nation's history. He knew there was no point in being a voice from the sidelines on the environment; you had to win government to protect it, and that's exactly what he did. He protected Kakadu and the Tasmanian wilderness as well. He saved the Franklin River from damming. He protected Antarctica, still the most significant environmental conservation action in the world's history. It's an incredible thing to have achieved. But I want to mention the World Heritage listing of the wet tropics. I was born in Cairns. My parents were born in Cairns. I and my family have a long history in Far North Queensland. As a child, one of my first memories of politics was how controversial that World Heritage listing of the wet tropics was. It seems like a no-brainer today but it was incredibly controversial. My uncle Jim worked in the sawmill at Ravenshoe, which was affected by the wet tropics' World Heritage listing. I remember the pain that that community went through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My earliest memory of Bob Hawke was of course the joyous memory of our Prime Minister being so engaged in our national sporting events. As a kid, you care so much about the fact that we won the America's Cup; it is such a big memory. But probably my second memory of him is of my aunt throwing a phone brick at the TV every time he came on, because she lived in Ravenshoe and logging was being shut down as a consequence of the World Heritage listing. They were hurt. Economic reform is not easy; environmental reform is not easy. But for me and countless people around the world, the World Heritage listing of that amazing wet tropics area, including the Daintree and all the way down almost to Townsville—it's a massive area of Queensland—is so important for the preservation of those World Heritage values. In fact, the first protest I ever attended, I was a kid. The first protest I ever attended as a child was to protest against a development planned for that World Heritage area. I wish I could do justice to the significance of the work that Bob Hawke did to protect the natural environment for the benefit of Australians and for the benefit of the world. He really was a great Australian and a great conservationist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob Hawke—Hawkie—was one of the greatest reformers in our history, along with Paul Keating and his predecessor Gough Whitlam. Those Labor prime ministers who came after them were fortunate to have them as people to look up to. I know that Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard drew so much from the legacy of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. There was something about Bob, wasn't there? There was something so Australian. He brought us together as a nation. Our country—our small but prosperous and brave country—became the optimistic, forward-thinking, modern nation that it is now because of the work that Bob did during his prime ministership. He is so sorely missed, because he was a proud Australian who did Australia proud. He will be missed. He's been honoured by the contributions that have been made today. We'll never forget his contribution or his memory. Cheers, Hawkie.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  Western Australia has created great things. Our nation's greatest Prime Minister, John Curtin, while born in Victoria, like many others sought work and prosperity in WA and, as the member for Fremantle, he led this nation through its darkest days in World War II. John Curtin remains the only Prime Minister to represent a Western Australian constituency. Our nation's greatest peacetime Prime Minister, Robert James Lee Hawke, while born in South Australia and holding a Victorian seat, was raised and spent his formative years in Western Australia. Western Australians can lay some very significant claim to these extraordinary Australian Labor leaders and our greatest prime ministers, John Curtin and Bob Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, today, we pay tribute to Bob Hawke. And, today, we have heard remarkable tributes in this place to a truly great Australian who indeed helped build this place and who made an unrivalled contribution to make Australia the remarkable nation that it is. Bob's life was that of a true federalist—born in South Australia, raised and educated in Western Australia, built a career in Victoria and here in the ACT and retiring, for the most part, in Sydney, New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have talked about his stellar achievements and his remarkable legacy that changed Australia for the better. Today, I'd like to reflect on the important part Western Australia played in the life of perhaps our last Western Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. He went to school at West Leederville Primary School, before going to Perth Modern School. From Perth Mod, he went to the University of Western Australia. My mum, Diana Morris, who was then Diana Pizer, grew up in the same area of Perth, in West Perth. I'm pleased to say that Mum is here today in the gallery, as it happens. They were of similar age, although Bob was a bit older. Bob went to the selective Perth Modern School through the granting of a scholarship and Mum went to a school nearby, Thomas Street State School, also in West Perth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Bob Hawke became Prime Minister, I was about 10 and Mum would mention that she used to go on youth camps with Bob and other teenagers in the Congregational Youth Fellowship. I didn't really ask more about it at the time because you don't when you are 10, but in reflecting on Bob Hawke's life recently Mum was telling me that this youth fellowship would go on camps to Point Peron in Rockingham. That's in my electorate. It was the old camp that many of my friends will remember from when they joined in the Uni Camp For Kids holiday camps for disadvantaged children. It was the old camp. It's gone now, thanks to the asbestos it was built with. The youth fellowship, which included Bob Hawke and the great Western Australian that he married, Hazel Masterson, my mum and her eldest friend, Ivy Heptinstall, and many others, would go on long walks from the Point Peron camp all the way around the coast along the beaches of Shoalwater Bay and then back again to the camp to enjoy that fellowship that formed part of growing up in Western Australia for young people in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Anyone who walks along the beaches of Shoalwater Bay cannot help but be struck by the beauty of these shores and look out at Bird Island, Seal Island and Penguin Island as they break up the horizon that stretches across the vast Indian Ocean. I sometimes think of the people who have walked across the sands of the place I call home, and it's oddly reassuring to know that Bob Hawke was one of the many people who have enjoyed Shoalwater Bay and that he did so as part of a fellowship that included my mum, who herself returned to live across from those islands some 10 years later. It's a place we still call home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After school, Bob went to the University of Western Australia to study arts and law, a path many Western Australians, including me and my husband, Jamie King, who's also here, have followed. Bob himself has said his approach to his studies was haphazard—again, a path that many follow at university, until the realisation dawns that it's perhaps better to get your act together and get on with the job at hand.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms MADELEINE KING:</span>
                  </a>  Maybe it takes five years; maybe it takes less. In recent weeks there has been a great deal of reflection on the motorcycle accident that nearly claimed his life. Bob himself has said it was the seminal turning point of his life. That turning point happened in Kings Park on Mount Eliza, which overlooks Perth. That accident perhaps says something about the challenges of negotiating a motorbike on the winding roads of Kings Park. But, more likely, the accident was a reflection of the recklessness of youth that feels it is invincible. Well, like all of us, Bob Hawke was not invincible, and he learned that in WA. After that accident, he went on to thrive in his studies at the University of Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today, the Attorney-General reflected on the great beauty of the UWA campus at Crawley. On this matter, he is right, and we are firmly agreed. Its gardens are unrivalled. So, while being Prime Minister of Australia may be the greatest job in the world, the other contender for this title is to be a gardener at the University of Western Australia. And, of course—wouldn't you know it?—Bob Hawke has done both, as he tended to that campus and all those gardens in his student years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1950, Bob Hawke was elected president of the UWA Societies Council. The following year he became guild vice-president, and in 1952 he became the 39th president of the Guild of Undergraduates of the University of Western Australia. In interview, he has reflected: 'Some of the happiest days of my life were here at the guild and UWA.' I have that in common with our Prime Minister, as do many Western Australians. It was an honour to be part of the ceremony in 2013 where the guild honoured him with life membership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob established the first international club at the university. He had met students from other countries who had come to study at UWA in Perth as part of the Colombo Plan and he immediately realised the value that could come from creating a greater and more engaging interaction with international students on the campus at that time. He knew instinctively the value of personal relationships and thought it would be a terrible waste—a wasted opportunity for the people of Perth—if local Perth students did not learn from these very intelligent young people from abroad. He was a true internationalist. In this manner and in many others in the future, he made Australia more open.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across 2012 and 2013, I was director of the centenary celebrations for UWA and had the chance to work with Bob a number of times. He was a most willing supporter of this celebration of the university that he recognised as having changed his life and that of many others, as it was the first free university of the British Empire and, therefore, Australia. It offered an opportunity to study for all who had the intellect and the will, so at that time there was a more diverse student body at the university than at universities on the east coast, where payment was a requirement for entry. Bob once came along during the centenary year to a photo shoot outside the old Senate room and at the home of the university cricket club, of which he'd been a member and a player. Alongside James Oval, he willingly held the bat and ball while we took some photos for our promotional materials. But he was willing only so long as his car could leave in time to get him to the WACA for the start of the first day of the Perth test.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I last spoke with Bob Hawke just over a year ago as I escorted him into Government House on St Georges Terrace to witness the swearing in of our mutual friend and his cabinet colleague, Kim Beazley, as Governor of Western Australia. He was, of course, more frail than before, but he still held court—in Kim Beazley's court, as it happens—with a glass of red wine, chatting to the great and good of Western Australia who wanted to catch their last glimpse and conversation with one of their very best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm increasingly of the view there is unlikely to be another Prime Minister representing a Western Australian seat. I really hope I am wrong, but that had previously last happened in 1945 and politics has changed as our constituencies and the media demand MPs not stray far from their electorates. Our WA electorates are all very far away from the centre of power in this country, and you can't change that geography. But Western Australians can be very proud to have contributed to this great nation our two greatest prime ministers, John Curtin and Bob Hawke. Western Australians should be proud to know that Bob's life and education in Western Australia formed the greatest peacetime Prime Minister of this nation, the Hon. Robert James Lee Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I offer my sincere condolences, and that of the people of Brand, to his entire family. Thank you for sharing him with us for so long. Your sacrifice has been great and must always be remembered. Vale, Bob Hawke, a truly great Australian—in solidarity forever.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FITZGIBBON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  Unsurprisingly, my interest in politics started at a pretty early age. Before serving both the Hawke and Keating governments, my father served in local government first as an alderman—as they were known in those days—and then as a mayor, so politics was a topic of conversation around my household from a young age. Of course, it nurtured an interest in me, but that interest was turbocharged with the election of the Hawke government in 1983. Like all Australians at a young age, I was fully aware of Bob Hawke and the things he'd achieved and the trade union movement at that time, and some of his larrikin behaviour as well. But it was something about his arrival in the Lodge that started me thinking more deeply about Australian politics and thinking about the opportunity to serve. He was a real inspiration to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was, of course, one of a kind—both larrikin and intellectual, champion sculler of beer and Rhodes Scholar. He was a person as comfortable in the parliament, or in a company boardroom or talking to world leaders as he was on the golf course or in the pub. He was quintessentially a man of the people. He was one of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember being so excited when he visited my hometown of Cessnock. I'm not sure of the year, but I suspect it was around 1985. Somehow, I don't know why, I got to be the person who delivered his speaking notes for a civic reception he was about to deliver at the Cessnock Town Hall. They'd obviously arrived behind him and someone, for some reason, had handed them to me to deliver to him. I was very excited by that prospect. I was just amazed at the way he, in a cursory way, seemed to just absorb everything the notes told him. I watched him then put them aside to see to the town hall and, without the notes, use everything that had been contained within them without having to refer to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also vividly recall one year when my father took a turn and spent a couple of days in the local hospital. Bob rang the hospital to check on my father's welfare. That phone call was the talk of the town. The then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, had phoned my father in hospital. Bob's celebrity status was well established by then. It was a celebrity status that not only flowed from his charisma and what he'd achieved in public life, but, of course, was influenced by what he had already achieved as a Prime Minister in a pretty short time. Maybe his greatest achievement was when <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>newspaper front page in 1984 boasted, 'Hawke is the man who is bringing us together.' It's not often a Labor Prime Minister gets such praise from a News Limited newspaper, I would suggest to you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He strived for consensus and unity of purpose. It was a leadership and management style he brought to the 1984 economic summit. He brought it to the cabinet process and, of course, he brought it to interactions between Indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. But it would be a mistake to say consensus was the only part of his model. There's a bit of mythology running around Australian politics and I must say, without breaking the spirit of these contributions, that we have seen a little bit of it today. Some will have you believe that all the difficult reforms of that period that Bob Hawke led were achieved on a bipartisan basis in this place, whereas, we know nothing could be further from the case. In fact, Bob Hawke's political opponents of the day fought those reforms every step of the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Bob always strived for consensus, but when consensus wasn't possible he had the courage and the conviction to forge ahead with those reforms—capital gains tax, asset test for pensioners, PBS reform. They were all difficult reforms, but a person like Bob Hawke was able to progress them, despite opposition from those who sat opposite at the time, because of that strength of leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have lost a great Australian. The Labor Party has lost one of its very, very best. I didn't know Bob all that well when he was Prime Minister, but I had the great privilege of getting to know him very well over the course of the last 10 years at Labor Party events, on the golf course and on a couple of occasions in his Sydney office, where I once went to have him speak to the camera for a video I was doing for Labor's country caucus. I gave him a one-minute brief on what I needed him to say, and that's all he needed. In one take, without hesitation, he gave me exactly what I needed. It was only two years ago; he was an elderly gentleman then. Post politics he maintained his dignity and he continued to serve his country but in different ways. It was a life well lived and long lived. We will miss him. My sympathies and condolences go to Blanche and the Hawke family.</span>

He was loved not only for his intelligence and leadership. He was loved by all because he was one of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been said about his amazing life and career. There have been some wonderful personal anecdotes of Bob, and I think that's what I'll concentrate on. Bob was the first PM I can recall actively listening to, especially after the America's Cup win. It's fair to say that, for me as a young lad, politics was not really on my radar; but when Hawkie spoke you listened. His words, his delivery, his passion told you that things would be better while he was in charge. Hawke gave us a sense of pride and purpose. As history shows, he gave us the ability to stand on our own two feet. Modern Australia is the result of Bob Hawke. Whether it be kings, queens, leaders or people in the street—no matter who you were—Bob spoke your language and listened to your views. He knew that for us to grow there would be tough calls, and he didn't shirk them. He knew that to get through you had to bring the community with you. As he said in 1983:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the first pledge I now make, a commitment which embraces every other undertaking, is that everything we do as a Government will have the one great goal—to reunite this great community of ours, to bring out the best we are truly capable of, together, as a nation, and bring Australia together to win our way through the crisis into which the policies of the past and the men of the past have plunged our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those words have stood the test of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My first meeting with Bob was on a night we were celebrating another great Australian, Peter Cleland. Peter's illness had taken a toll, but we were determined to celebrate Peter. When I asked Bob's office if he would come, there was no hesitation. So in my first campaign I was given the honour of sitting with Bob; Peter; Peter's wife, Jan; Kim Beazley; and Rob Hulls. I was studying Bob to see how he prepared for his address. There wasn't a lot to learn, because with just a couple of scraps of paper Bob was off. That night was one of the most inspiring and passionate speeches I have ever heard. Over 300 people sat in silence as Bob delivered a powerful message spelling out why Australians needed to remove a conservative government and reminding us that the big reforms, the huge nation-building decisions and putting Australia on the international stage, were all achievements of Labor, and as Labor people we had the responsibility to stand up and to fight for ordinary Australians and our most vulnerable. Bob spoke of his work and passion: tirelessly fighting to give Australians a good living wage. He put a question to the room: how could anyone in good conscience ever vote for the conservatives, who at every single opportunity fought against every single wage increase for working Australians? Those words have stuck fast in my mind. Of course, there was the obligatory singing of 'Solidarity Forever' with Bob at the microphone and his sheepish back-up singers in Kim Beazley, Brian Harding and me. I can let you in on a secret: Bob had the verses to himself, because I didn't know them anyway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010 I had the pleasure of having the great man come to Gisborne. We were in a fight to win the seat, and Bob was there to help us. He let me know that that was how we were going to win it. This was just after the miniseries was put out, and Bob was relishing it. He walked the streets, he entered the shops and he stopped passers-by. If I got more than two inches from him, a stern hand would go around my back and drag me closer. He'd say to the person in front: 'Are you going to vote for this bloke? Rob is the man you need.' In a quiet moment, he leaned over and he said: 'Stand uncomfortably close, son. That way you'll be in the pictures.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People flocked from all over to see the great man. The newsagencies sold out the Hawke book in two minutes flat. Bob kindly reminded them that he had made them have a great day. As he passed through the supermarket, I remember a lady who said, 'Jeez, you were cheeky back then.' With a big smile and twist of his head, he said: 'Still am, love. I still am.' He said it in a way that only Bob could. From start to finish, every person took the opportunity to meet with him. Such was his gravitas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To everyone, he was one of them. As a Labor person, I'm proud he was one of us. To his family, thank you. Thank you for sharing him. To his friends, cherish the memories. May you rest forever in peace, Bob. You've earned it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  I'm grateful for the opportunity to share a few reflections on the Hon. Robert James Lee Hawke, AC. In preparing for this, I consulted with someone who I consider a friend, a mentor and an inspiration. That was the former member for Oxley, Bill Hayden, who is a great Labor Prime Minister that we never had. I consulted him about arguably Labor's greatest Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. Bill Hayden maintained enormous respect for Bob Hawke, and they had an excellent working relationship in government together. I thought I would relate some of Bill's eloquent condolence message to Bob's family at the time of the state funeral. I quote these words with Bill's permission:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Much of the country is in mourning at the passing of our former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bob Hawke was a contemporary icon of Labor. I was his foreign minister for just on five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He was a great manager to work with and I believe that we worked well together as a team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the period during which I worked with him, to use a cricketing analogy which he would have liked, he was the Don Bradman of Australian politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There was no peer. He had his weaknesses, which were very human, but he made no secret of them, which endeared him to the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am truly saddened by his passing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My sympathies goes to his children and widow, Blanche, who has loyally stood beside him in these more recent declining years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Bill Hayden's words about Bob Hawke sum up pretty much the sentiments of many people and certainly me perfectly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Bob and Bill had a special, if nuanced and unusual, relationship. Once rivals for leadership, they became firm partners in reform. After Bill served as foreign affairs minister, it was Bob who appointed him as Governor-General. Bill was delighted that Bob introduced Medicare to cement forever his Medibank legacy from the Whitlam era. It was through Bill that Bob had a real connection with my home city of Ipswich, where he was much loved. Bill would ask Bob to come up to Queensland to campaign for Labor and for local candidates in particular. Of course, Bob usually obliged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at the Blair campaign meeting on the Thursday night before the election when the news came of Bob's passing. It was certainly a very sad, sombre and solemn tone to the end of the campaign. Growing up under the tyranny of the Bjelke-Petersen regime in Queensland, I had not voted for a successful Labor Party until Bob Hawke led us to victory in 1983. There was a contrast with that night of his passing to when I walked into a polling booth at East Ipswich in 1983 and voted, as an elector in the electorate in Oxley, for my local member, Bill Hayden. I was disappointed for Bill but hopeful and eager for Bob. He didn't let us down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege, like many on this side, of meeting Bob many times over the years, including when he visited South East Queensland, in Canberra and in far away places like Arnhem Land at the Garma festival, which was when I was the shadow Indigenous affairs minister. I remember the praise and adulation he received on these occasions. His energy levels would visibly rise when this would happen. I, along with many Australians, have much to thank Prime Minister Bob Hawke for. He transformed our country and improved the lives of everyday Australians, including my family, in countless ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time someone pulls a Medicare card out of their wallets, they should think of and thank Bob Hawke for it. Whether it is reforms to health care, high school completion rates, Indigenous rights, the economy, superannuation, the workplace, our legal system, sex discrimination, environment, immigration, multiculturalism or achievements like the accord, equal pay and affirmative action, he changed our country for the better. He did it with consensus regularly and confrontation when necessary, domestically and internationally. His reforms modernised our country and set us up for the incredible economic success and social progress of the last 30 years as a prosperous, open and inclusive society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a critical moment in our history, he saw the burning platform; he knew what needed to be done, he could communicate that effectively and was able to take the nation with him. For that, we owe him an immense debt of gratitude. He rightly deserves to be lauded as Labor's greatest peacetime Prime Minister. Thanks to his wife, Blanche, and his family for sharing him with us. Thanks to his first wife Hazel as well. I offer my sincere condolences and that of my electorate of Blair to his family. Vale, Bob Hawke, you good and faithful servant of the Labor Party and the labour movement. You fought the good fight, you kept the faith and you ran the race to the end.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I'm grateful to have this opportunity to make a few short remarks and pay tribute to the life of Bob Hawke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was, back in 1983, glued to watching the America's Cup—I was in Western Australia at the time—like everyone else in the country. Seared in the national consciousness is not only the win but perhaps the memorable phrase, 'Any boss who sacks anyone for not turning up today is a bum'. I'm not sure what was more exciting to me as an 11-year-old in Perth—hearing a Prime Minister say 'bum' on television or being able to stay up that late to watch the television. In any event, it was something that not only brought him to the political attention of many of us as young people but also seared in our consciousness that here was a figure who was, in many respects, not only larger than life but also very different from many of the people who had come before him to occupy the position of Prime Minister. I want to pay a tribute, especially to those on the Labor side of politics. A bit of time has passed but I know many people will be feeling it very, very deeply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say two brief things now as we reflect on the life of someone who made a very, very big difference to the country. The first is that his ascension to become the Prime Minister in 1983, where he was able to sit there on television and utter those immortal words, was in large part due to the environment and in large part due to a people-powered movement, not just in Tasmania but right around the country, around the Franklin Dam. That movement energised people in defence of one of the most amazing places of nature in our country. It energised people in this country in a way that probably hadn't been seen before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That incredible movement was taking place, obviously, on the eve of an election, and Bob Hawke took a punt on the environment and he took a punt on people. He made a promise from opposition to stop the destruction of some amazing wilderness. It did come at a cost in Tasmania but it helped him to victory and he delivered. It has to be acknowledged that, as far as the environment and those promises that he made are concerned, he delivered in a way that was consistent with what he promised to do and in a way that no-one else had done before. For that, many of us who have come afterwards owe him and his government a debt of gratitude. Indeed, Bob Brown called him—if I paraphrase correctly—'the best Prime Minister Australia has had for the environment'. Coming from someone like Bob Brown, I think that's an accolade that is very well deserved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look back and reflect on that, one of the things that's notable is that one doesn't need to be in government to work with a people-powered movement to make a difference, to bring about a change and then to get into government and deliver it. As we face some very, very significant challenges, not the least which is climate change—an emergency that we haven't seen before—we ought to take a leaf out of his book and understand that taking a punt for the benefit of the environment and for the benefit of people, and making some decisions that, yes, might alienate some people but are ultimately for the national good and for the global good, can pay off. It can pay off in electoral terms, it can pay off for the planet and it can pay off for people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reflection that I certainly have as we pay tribute to the life of Bob Hawke is that he ushered in a remarkable era of economic and social change in this country. Much of that I disagree with, because it has to be said that it was that era—the 1980s and subsequently the 1990s—that ushered in neoliberalism in Australia. Neoliberalism is a philosophy I disagree with and I think it's no coincidence that the rise of different political movements like the Greens happened at around the same time that those policies were being implemented in Australia. But, it can't be denied that with that came a number of changes to what they called the social wage at the time, and we are the beneficiaries of that and all of us in this parliament should be the defenders of that. Nowhere is that more clear and more the case than in health care, for example, and with Medicare, and we ought to pay tribute to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the second thing that we ought to learn from that period of reform—again, as we face immense challenges to deal with climate change and the changes and the potential dislocation that that's going to bring to people and to communities, as well as the opportunities that it opens up—is that we ought not lose sight of the fact that we have the opportunity to do another version of that, but perhaps a different version of it: to remind ourselves that, in Australian history, it was possible to get people around a table and to make significant social and economic reforms that ultimately set the country up in a certain way for the future. As I say, I disagreed with some of those reforms, but the fact is they were done and it should be acknowledged that they were done. We have the opportunity, in a sense, to learn from that and to do a mark 2 of that to ensure that we deal with the climate challenge and with some of the challenges of underemployment that we have in this country. That kind of big vision is something that we ought not lightly lose sight of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I know there are many people in Melbourne who probably voted for a member of parliament who became a member of a government under Bob Hawke. There are many people who still hold a lot of affection for him and there are many, many significant things that he achieved. I'm pleased to be able to pay tribute to his life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  There is much to talk about when it comes to celebrating the life of Bob Hawke. I actually participated in my first campaign in 1983 because of the Franklin. I didn't join the party at the time, but I volunteered in that election. I didn't know Bob Hawke as well as many of the people in this House did, so I'm not going to talk about the man; I'm going to talk about the changes that he made—in fact, just one change: to education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm only going to talk about education because the Hawke government changed our expectations. He expanded our world. For people in neighbourhoods like the one where I grew up, and in the heart of Western Sydney, the Hawke government lifted our gaze to the possibilities of education. And we needed to lift our gaze, because, when Labor won government in 1983, Australia had some of the lowest high school completion rates in the Western world. As bad as that was, Western Sydney lagged a long way behind the rest of Sydney. If you meet Western Sydney today, you'll see one of the characteristics that I love most: we are a place where families with no history of tertiary education send a child to university for the first time. I was the first in my family, and in Western Sydney I'm surrounded by thousands of others who are first in family and proud of it. The then Prime Minister Bob Hawke laid the foundations for that during his term. The Hawke government, by the way, gave us Western Sydney University. Whitlam committed to it, Fraser reneged and the Hawke and Keating government built it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, it's the opportunity of high school education that touches me most, and perhaps that's because it is personal. I went to school before the Hawke years, in the sixties and seventies, and one of my clearest memories at that time, and one that still disturbs me to this day, was sitting in a classroom and hearing the teacher tell us that one of our friends had special dispensation to leave school at 14 and go to work, because his parents couldn't afford to keep him at school. I remember the look on his face, the slumped shoulders, him looking at the ground with no eye contact. We didn't see him again. He was a smart, attractive, athletic, witty kid who had everything in him to do well but not the things he needed to do something that today we would consider basic: finish high school. We left school in large numbers. We had two senior classes. Out of hundreds that started grade 8, we had two senior classes—one physics class that was half-full and one advanced maths. I was the only girl who studied science and maths, and only one of a handful that went on to tertiary education. The exception was for teaching, which was paid for by a scholarship. The cost of poverty was extremely high. The cost of disadvantage was wasted talent and lost opportunity, both at the individual level and at the national level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Hawke government, we saw a commitment to providing opportunity for all and to expecting that children could do something as basic in today's world as finishing high school. I want you to understand how profound the disadvantage was in Western Sydney, so I am going to talk numbers. I've got a report here that came from the 1987 parliamentary report into retention rates. It breaks up the community into 10 socioeconomic groups, with one as the lowest socioeconomic group and 10 as the highest. What you see with these is that the difference in boys between the lowest socioeconomic group and the highest is 30 per cent—less than half of children. This was in 1987, by the way, after there had been quite a substantial improvement. Forty-three per cent of boys in the lower socioeconomic group finished high school, and over 75 per cent in the highest group did. That's an extraordinary difference. For girls it was about the same—53 per cent in the lowest group, and 85 in the highest group. Again, a 30 per cent difference between the lowest socioeconomic group and the highest. But it's even more extraordinary if you understand that the average, which was about 55 per cent at the time, wasn't in the middle. It was actually so skewed towards the upper socioeconomic areas that 70 per cent of the population was below average in terms of retention. Thirty per cent was in the top three—no, I obviously shouldn't talk numbers this late at night. Either way, the skewing was extraordinary. Seventy per cent of the year 12 population completed year 12 at below-average rates. Again, you look at the numbers and you see that 43 per cent of kids finished school in the lowest socioeconomic group, but it was only 50 per cent in the seventh, then 55, 63, and then 76 per cent in the 10th—extraordinary skewing towards upper socioeconomic groups. In Western Sydney there were some profound challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How did they do it? How did they increase the retention rate from around 30 to the mid-70s? Well, with some quite profound change. When the Hawke government came to power, the Commonwealth's influence on schooling policy was indirect. It consisted of funding state based programs. The Hawke government knew that if education were to serve the needs of the economy, then education policy must be steered at federal level. So they created the federal Department of Employment, Education and Training, and they also established the Australian Education Council, comprising federal, state and tertiary education ministers. It was in the 1980s that we got a federal department for education. The first national goals for schooling were established in 1989.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They did the hard structural changes, but they also put effort in on the ground. Much of change is due to the targeting of areas of most need. The $70 million participation and equity program focused on access and participation, targeting the 40 per cent of schools with the lowest retention rates and focusing on curriculum and school culture. It made an extraordinary difference. Imagine that difference from my time in school, when leaving at 15 was the norm, to a world where staying in school is the usual path.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lot to thank the Hawke government for. He changed our lives for the better in so many ways. This is just one of them. Vale Bob Hawke.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  I'm very pleased to be able to make a very short contribution to this very important motion. All of us here in Australia in 2019 walk in Bob Hawke's shadow—especially those of us who are part of the Labor family and everyone who sees our country's story as written by its enlargers. Through this prism, none emerge more significant than Bob Hawke. Deputy Speaker and friends on many side of the House, if we believe, as I passionately do, that it was Gough Whitlam who imagined how modern Australia might be, it was Bob Hawke who made it and fixed so much of it so firmly in place that conservatives have not been able to dismantle its achievements. It was under Hawke that we as a country reached out to the world, standing confidently and optimistically in our place. His confidence in Australians, his belief in his fellow Australians and his love for his fellow Australians were turned into a confidence in Australia as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate has been going on for some time today, as is appropriate, and I am of the view that certainly the Bob Hawke of the 1970s would feel it's way past time that we adjourned to the pub for a more informal set of reflections! So I propose to be very brief and not go over ground that has been covered so eloquently by my colleagues, including our leader, and the Prime Minister and so many speakers on the government side in paying due respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to touch on four things very quickly and then make a brief personal reflection. When we discuss how Bob Hawke opened Australia to the world, the one thing that we must focus on is how he built the social wage, an absolutely critical compact by a government that was reaching out to the world with a sense of a modern, globalised economy and a sense of responsibility to citizenship. If we think about that cornerstone of the social wage in Medicare, we understand just how important Bob Hawke's legacy is to how Australians see our country and our relationship to one another. The member for Parramatta spoke of school retention. It's amazing to think of Australia before that goal and what it has meant for us as a knowledge based economy. We can't neglect to reflect on his extraordinary contribution to the environment, his recognition of the challenge of climate change as a core responsibility for government to respond to and the series of commitments he made to preserve our beautiful natural environment—from the Franklin all the way to Kakadu and Antarctica.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I mention his compassion. I think the thing that struck people more than anything else at the beautiful memorial at the Sydney Opera House was the reflection on his determination to do justice to those displaced by the tragic events in Tiananmen Square. That sense of compassion overriding advice in recognition of common humanity is something we should all look to as we recall the Hawke legacy, as indeed we look to how he conducted his government and his approach to politics and how he presented himself to Australians—a very true picture, which I think explains so much of the love for him that existed then and endures today and will endure beyond today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like probably most of us, I have my images of Bob Hawke that have guided me. There was the 1990 election. His very narrow victory then was the first political contest that energised and affected me. I was very privileged to work with and enjoy the mentorship of a man called Peter Redlich at the firm Holding Redlich. Peter Redlich was a great mate of Bob Hawke's. Peter Redlich couldn't understand why my political journey didn't follow Hawke's to a more pragmatic direction within the party.</span>

                  </a>  Many can't understand it! But to see close up their friendship, how they modernised Labor and how Bob Hawke modernised Australia was an extraordinary privilege. To have briefly spent time with Bob Hawke is something I will cherish, as I will cherish the fact that Bob Hawke got to spend a little bit of time with my son, Daniel Giles, on the campaign trail in 2010. I'm not sure if Daniel remembers this, but I hope—in fact, I know—that he'll be talking about it for many years to come. All my condolences go to Blanche and Bob's family and to all of those who loved him. Vale, Bob Hawke.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  I want to make some contributions to this condolence motion for former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. In doing so, I'm very conscious of the terrific contributions that have been made through the course of the day reflecting on specific elements of Bob Hawke's legacy. I don't seek to replicate all of those. I want to focus on three things in this part of the day: his focus on belief, specifically belief in himself, in our people and in our nation. I think the belief he had in these three groups, particularly himself, obviously, were very important to driving the contribution that he made to our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of people have reflected on Bob Hawke's self-belief, and we've had a wry smile about that, but the reality is that politics is a difficult vocation. Pushing for change against a lot of interests that will counter your push in very significant ways is not easy. You have to have faith in yourself and what you believe in if you're to change the face of this country. Bear in mind the challenge that he had at that time, in the early eighties. As people have said, the country had been in the grip of drought and recession, had high unemployment and high inflation and had an economy that had reached the end of what it could do in the way that it was structured. To do those things—make those changes and argue those policies—and to put them to the Australian people needed a lot of confidence. Obviously, having that self-belief was very important. But it was not just that. It was being comfortable of himself, within himself, to move with a wide variety of people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People have reflected on his friendship with Sir Peter Abeles. He could talk to that part of the country, to the captains of industry, as they were called, right through to the people on the street. He was able to do that because he was comfortable in himself and did not believe that by virtue of the fact that he was dealing with business, with industry, he was sacrificing who he was. It meant that he had confidence in himself to change as times suited. The Bob Hawke who led the ACTU was different from the Bob Hawke who led the country. He recognised that he had to move with the times. Again, it required a comfort within himself to be able to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As much as we are venerating the Hawke-Keating era, many of us grew up in those times and saw what they were able to achieve. There is not a requirement on us to maintain strictly the legacy, to return to the Hawke-Keating legacy of itself. Hawke and Keating were important because they were modernisers. They saw what was happening at that point in time and they made sure government fit those times. This is the most important legacy. It is not to repeat Hawke-Keating but to understand that at the point in time you find yourself on that side of the House you are ready to make those changes. That is an important lesson in itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had belief in people. What I found most important about Bob Hawke was that he believed people were there to be convinced. He was not there delivering the lines of the day or what the focus group said needed to be said. He actually thought that, if people had a view and it was different from his, it was his role to convince them to move away from something they held strongly and dearly to themselves for the better outcome of the nation. I remember very well, in all the words that were being said when we all found out that Bob Hawke had passed on, Barrie Cassidy recounted a story about Bob Hawke at a point in time when there was anti-immigration feeling and he had resolutions in this place to contend with. Advisers were saying to him, 'Bob, you probably shouldn't speak against this, because there's strong sentiment in favour of it.' Cassidy recalled, 'Hawke's response was not to kowtow to that feeling but instead to say, "Give me the arguments to convince people otherwise."' He had belief in people. He believed that people wanted to be convinced. The greatest respect you can extend to people is to believe inherently in their intelligence, to put forward the arguments for them to consider and then to respond accordingly. This is a very important lesson, and one I think stands true today as much as it did then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His belief in people extended to his expectations of people. People have reflected on the achievements on school retention rates, but he was saying to people, particularly in my part of Western Sydney, 'I expect that you will continue school, that you will be able to go on to years 11 and 12.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw it myself in Western Sydney: when you're a year 10 student out in Blacktown, and you have 150 students in year 10 and you're left with 50 in year 11 and everyone leaving the system. Why? It wasn't an end in itself. It was a realisation that the world was changing and that people's skills needed to be enhanced, and that for the longer term it was better for them, in terms of the things they wanted to achieve in their life, that they stayed in school longer. He had an expectation. It was not, 'Just because you're from Western Sydney you won't go to school and broaden your mind and get those skills.' He expected you to go on at school and he made sure that government was resourcing those schools so that people could achieve. He had a belief in people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, his belief in country. He believed that this nation had a legitimate place on the world stage—not just a place but that its voice should be heard. People have talked about our role in helping drive the establishment of APEC. There are the other things we talked about, like trade liberalisation. For example, he, with others, drove the establishment of the Cairns Group to argue for trade liberalisation at a time when people asked why we would push for trade liberalisation when no-one else would. Mind you, we see a similar sort of argument on climate change: why should Australia make a contribution on climate change when the rest of the world is doing what it does and we can't possibly make a dent there? But the trade liberalisation that he pushed for, and the way it would help the economy and generate new job opportunities and wealth for the nation, was important. He believed in that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the biggest thing in terms of the world stage, where he believed that Australia could legitimately have a voice, was his belief that a country which separated its people on the basis of race was not a legitimate form of government and that we should press for better within the Commonwealth. He said that we should take this on. As a trade union official or a Prime Minister of this nation, what he did—and can I just say, for those of us who think that Australia, with its weight and size, can't necessarily influence the direction or the way that things happen around the globe, we should remember we can do this. People like Bob Hawke and others showed that where it is right to do so we should have a belief in our nation and we should push for better on the world stage. We should not take it as a given or just believe that we should retreat and not push for better on the world stage. Amongst all the things that Bob Hawke did, ending apartheid, for what it was worth, is one of his biggest legacies, because it reflected everything about Bob Hawke—a belief in himself, a belief that people deserve better and the belief that a country can actually make a meaningful difference. We cannot thank him enough for what he did for this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He helped me out on my campaign. Time prohibits me from speaking more about the profound impact that he had on me as a person, but all of us in our contributions today simply cannot say enough thank yous for what he did. We cannot extend enough our condolences to his family for what they are going through. This nation is better because of a person who had belief in himself and the country he ultimately went on to lead. Vale Bob Hawke, and thank you for everything you've done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  I remember the first time that I met Bob Hawke. I was but a lad riding on my dad's shoulders. It was at Frye Park in Kelmscott, and there was a huge crowd. That's really all I can remember, but I was only about three or four at the time. I'm told by our local state MP from that time that the occasion was the opening of the new Kelmscott soccer club facilities just up from where my office is now. He said it was like the coming of the Messiah—thousands of people all jostling just to be able to touch Bob on the head as he walked through the crowd. In a way, that is how I have and will forever remember Bob Hawke: the man adored by the people. Such occasions were common. A former federal MP for my community described it as like watching Pope Bob. Another predecessor of mine noted the delight Bob had at posing for a photo at the gravestone of an Australian soldier, killed in action during the war in France, with the same name as that MP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A pseudo Western Australian, Bob Hawke attended school in WA and studied law at the University of Western Australia with my grandfather in the late 1940s. They were both born in South Australia too. Prime Minister Hawke led the federal Labor government I grew up under and he epitomised the Labor values that I learnt. In a way, they encapsulated that government. In a sense, it was the third way before that was a thing. As our 23rd Prime Minister, he reformed our country in many ways with one of the most brave and ambitious policy agendas in our history. Indeed, in modernising our country he changed our country and transformed our economy. He turned Australia into a world leader in so many areas. Critically, though, it was full of hope and bold of idea. However, as much as the government benches now try to claim credit and align themselves with the policies from that time, there has always been a critical difference, and that is in the way that Labor, under Hawke, always ensured a proper social safety net, for growth is stronger when it is shared, and when wages and living standards rise everyone in the community should benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob was also a strong advocate for women's rights, striving to achieve equal payment for men and women and protecting women from sexual harassment in the workplace. The current Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 is the legacy of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act of 1986. By 1990, the Hawke Labor government had committed more than $1 million to establish the Commonwealth-state National Committee on Violence Against Women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Bob came to office, fewer than three in 10 kids finished school. By the time he left, that number was eight in 10. Bob helped us realise a person's education or future prospects should not be determined by their postcode, and this is a message that continues to resonate with me today. Prime Minister Hawke also infamously said that by 1990 no Australian child would be living in poverty. I remember studying cartoons about this in my social studies classes in high school in the mid-1990s. I recall thinking at the time that it was a bold goal that clearly wasn't achieved, but in no way was it something that should not be striven for. He inspired me to work to help change the story for the kids in my community, one of Western Australia's lowest socioeconomic areas. Bob's beginnings were in union organising and bargaining for all, making sure, in a way that was responsible, through the Prices and Incomes Accord, for economic growth, that every worker received a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most quintessentially, each and every Australian carries with them each and every day a monument to Bob Hawke and his government—a green and gold reminder in the form of a Medicare card. It ensures that we do, indeed, live in the lucky country and that the health of one of us matters to all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to my new shadow portfolio of WA resources. There's a good chance that our resources industry wouldn't be what it is today without Bob Hawke's input. He was a pivotal figure in opening up the Pilbara iron ore industry to foreign investment. In the late 1980s, he was one of the main drivers behind ensuring delivery of the landmark Channar joint venture agreement, a 20-year joint venture that has resulted in the export of more than 250 million tonnes of iron ore to China by Rio Tinto. Today, China accounts for more than 83 per cent of WA's iron ore exports. Bob is also credited with facilitating the petroleum resource rent tax, alongside WA senator Peter Walsh and, of course, Treasurer Paul Keating. This was a vital initiative on tax reform for minerals, which effectively saved Western Australia from the possibility of going broke at the beginning of the term of the Hawke government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, no event that Bob took part in lately was complete without a bellowing rendition of 'Solidarity Forever'. I'll spare the chamber my version. On one of his most recent trips to WA, when he came to help in the election of the McGowan state Labor government, it was no different. On that visit I had the opportunity to introduce my son, Nicholas, to Bob, and later Bob sang <span style="font-style:italic;">Solidarity Forever </span>with us all. Soon enough Nicholas will be old enough to appreciate what a special moment that was for him and for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I extend my condolences to Blanche, Bob's children and his grandchildren. Vale, Hawkie. Rest in peace.</span>
