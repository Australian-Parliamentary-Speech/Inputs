          The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 29 March 1995, concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that it proceed, subject to the following recommendations. Firstly, the redevelopment should proceed, provided the agreed amendment of the national capital plan amendment No. 12 Russell does not require changes to the design and siting of roadworks and buildings. Secondly, if the agreed amendment to the national capital plan—that is, amendment No. 12 Russell—requires changes to the proposed redevelopment, these changes will need to be considered by the committee.

A draft amendment to the national capital plan was prepared to create sites for the new buildings proposed.

         Melbourne airport, the second busiest airport in Australia, is subject to continuing growth and passenger movements.

          The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 1 June 1995 recommending the project at an estimated cost of $55 million. In its report, the committee raised a number of issues to which the FAC has provided the following responses. The FAC has arranged as part of its contract with the project manager for design and construction for a thorough re-evaluation of the concept design for the car park which was considered by the Public Works Committee.

        The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the superannuation policy statement of 28 June 1994.

         Some of the measures in the bill, such as the employee share scheme provisions, are new and largely self-contained. These have been drafted in the new tax law improvement style. Other measures in the bill either amend existing provisions of the law or interrelate with concepts already contained in other parts of the law; for example, the late lodgment penalty and interest provisions. For these reasons, it has not been possible to fully adopt the new drafting style as this would entail changes to a much broader range of provisions. The tax law improvement project will be redrafting the tax law over the next three years.

The new regime will generally apply from 6 p.m. in the ACT—and the equivalent time elsewhere—on 28 March 1995.

The government considers that the extension is appropriate because the equalisation program is not yet completed in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, and it would be inequitable to deny licensees in those states the benefit of the incentive which had been available to eastern mainland licensees.

         —Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) is an omnibus tax bill dealing with tax exemptions for state and territory bodies, employee share acquisition schemes, refunds of tax file number amounts deducted in error, pensions, allowances and benefits, superannuation measures, late lodgment penalties and sales tax. The most substantive changes in this bill are contained in schedule 2, which deals with the tax treatment of employee share acquisition schemes. This is the government's third attempt in 13 months to change the tax rules on employee share acquisition schemes. The approach taken by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and his office on this matter could only be described as bloody-minded and intransigent. It has been part of a continuing pattern to restrict and marginalise employee share acquisition schemes.

         In commending the bill to the House, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in relation to these measures: `The nature of these measures is such that a reliable estimate of the revenue impact cannot be provided.' The government cannot say it is doing this to raise revenue or, if it is defeated, that it will cost revenue. The government says itself that it cannot give any estimate of the revenue impact. Probably closer to the truth is the fact that the government cannot estimate the revenue implications because this is not so much designed at revenue; it is designed to have the effect of restricting or wiping out employee share acquisition schemes. If that be its effect, there would be no revenue implications as a result.

         When it was clear to everybody that the Treasurer's plan to bring employee share ownership plans into the net of fringe benefits was atrocious and would effectively destroy the operation of all existing schemes, the Treasurer carried on regardless, not listening to anyone, steadfastly ignoring industry concerns, and seeking to push ahead with his plan, under cover and with all sorts of outlandish claims. The Treasurer and his office even ignored warnings and advice coming from their own department. In a particularly poor display, the Treasurer lashed out at his critics as supporters of tax avoidance. That has never been the case. If there is any rorting going on under the current system I make it clear, and those companies which support our stand on this matter make it clear, that it should be identified and such amendments undertaken as would prevent it.

         The tax treatment of share options is still a complete disaster. The taxing of options is inequitable and harsh. It taxes a potential gain that may never be realised. This is contrary to the general principle that income is taxable only on realisation. No allowance or concession is provided for employees participating in schemes operated by foreign parent companies, where options may be issued with a maximum exercise period of 10 years. Employees in Australia would be forced to pay tax either up-front or five years after acquisition. The five-year minimum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving employees with a tax liability to be met most probably by selling options in that case for the benefit of paying the tax accrued.

        These are all companies that are currently operating employee share schemes and this is legislation which threatens the viability of such schemes. It is not just the companies. The government should not sit there and think to itself, `This is just the companies' position.' This is the position of the employees of those companies. That is whom we are talking about here: the employees of those companies that have been given a stake in those companies through employee share ownership plans, and they want to continue on with it. It is good for them, it is good for the company, it is good for savings and it is good for Australia.

Schedule 1 of this bill amends the income and sales tax laws to exempt wholly owned state and territory bodies from income tax and sales tax, except for certain specified bodies in accordance with the agreement reached at the 1994 Premiers Conference for equivalent state regimes to be introduced.

Other bodies may also be excluded by agreement between the states and the Commonwealth. The income tax exemption will apply from and including the 1994-95 year of income.

To begin with, the government fails to extend relief to small super funds. The government's legislation specifically excludes super funds with fewer than five members.

These affect employee share schemes, new lodgment penalties, superannuation and capital gains tax roll-overs for merging superannuation funds.

         In all 14 measures are dealt with by this bill. I intend to deal with only some of them. Most notably, I intend, as did my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), to focus on the proposals relating to employee share schemes. The tax treatment of employee share schemes was debated in this place last November while we were considering the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994. It was then that Labor first tried to strangle the operation of employee share acquisition schemes.

         Labor tried to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to impose FBT on employee share benefits which arise when an employee acquires shares or rights to shares for an amount less than the market value. The premise on which the government decided to impose FBT on employee share acquisition schemes, which are known as ESAS, was the same as is now being offered. The government claims there is a potential and a likelihood that ESAS will be abused by employees and employers as a means of providing increased remuneration by non-PAYE means. Its reasoning is that this would have the potential of corrupting the tax base.

The big problem with Labor's heavy-handed approach now, as it was then, is that it will destroy ESAS.

         However, with this measure the government has shown itself yet again to be overly heavy-handed. As the law now stands, section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act taxes benefits arising from shares or rights to acquire shares—which, for ease of speech in subsequent remarks, I will refer to as `rights'—under an employee share acquisition scheme. Shares or rights are acquired in a company under an ESAS if the shares or rights are a consequence of employment or services rendered by the taxpayer or a relative.

         The shares or rights acquired may be in the employing company or another company. If the shares are subject to restrictions or conditions so that the right of the taxpayer to dispose of the shares is restricted or the employee can be divested of ownership, then the employee is automatically taxed on the discount in the year when the restrictions or conditions are lifted. But the taxpayer can elect to be taxed in the year that the shares or rights are acquired. If the shares are not subject to such conditions, the employee is taxed in the year that the shares or rights are acquired.

The effect of an election is that no further tax is payable under the division, and the shares or rights will then be subject to general provisions of the income tax legislation, including capital gains tax law.

         The flip side of the coin is that the proposed scheme has the following disadvantages compared with what currently applies: the proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefit is realised; the five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving employees with an unfunded tax liability; the qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are far too tight; there is no refund of the tax paid on options that lapse; the valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options; and most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed up front.

         Employee share acquisition schemes would be more successful in terms of the number of participants if they allowed a bigger discount; widened the qualifying conditions to allow access to the discount; allowed the issue of shares other than ordinary shares—not redeemable preference or partly paid, but perhaps shares with restricted or non-voting rights; provided the capacity to recover tax paid when options lapse; and allowed a deduction for loss incurred on disposal, although this may have to be subject to restrictions. Employee share acquisition schemes are very important for several reasons, including the fact that they give workers a stake in their workplace, provide a means of creating a fairer society and build the level of national savings.

         Labor and the coalition come at this issue from entirely different perspectives. ESAS schemes have long been encouraged by the coalition, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already pointed out, and have faced their stiffest resistance from sections of the Labor movement. This resistance has come from both the trade unions and the Labor Party. For the trade unions, it has traditionally been important to them to maintain the distinctions between capital and labour. It was not—and still is not, according to some—desirable for workers to gain shares in the company which employs them, because to do so would erode the unity of the labour movement in the face of the influence of capital.

         —Well, you are one of the few on your side—particularly in your faction—who has not. ESAS is important to our longer term economic growth and increased levels of productivity. ESAS is also an industrial relations issue that helps draw workers and management together. In firms where workers are also shareholders in the firm, the workers have a greater work ethic which is related to their desire to see the firm in which they have a stake do well. It is in the interests of the workers to increase profitability.

         The very notion of ESAS puts the fear of God into the hearts of some of Labor's mates in the trade unions. Many unions fear ESAS because employees who own shares lose their `them and us' mentality and, therefore, lose the desire to engage in petty and bloody-minded industrial action. This is possibly an unintended consequence of imposing the fringe benefits tax on ESAS—an unintended consequence which Labor is quite happy to live with and which will be lauded by its union mates.

         Not only does ESAS provide employees with an increased stake in the future of their company, but such schemes also give workers a greater stake in their community and in their society. A work force of small shareholders will do a great deal for improving the lot of this country. A nation of shareholders will make society less unequal and will improve the commitment of Australians to our democratic and capitalist system. Instead, we have a scenario under Labor where the rich are getting richer, mainstream Australians are deprived of opportunity and the poor are increasingly locked into a welfare induced poverty cycle in far too many cases. This does nothing but alienate an increasing number of people.

We all pay lip-service to increasing national saving, yet the government's approach is based solely on increasing the amount of money going into superannuation, when it could do much more to encourage further savings by inclusive policies.

         The bill introduces a new regime of penalties for late lodgment of income tax returns. Two different late lodgment penalty systems apply, depending on the category of taxpayer. For companies, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, pooled superannuation funds and some trusts, currently a flat penalty system applies. This is applied at the rate of $25 per week for the period that a return is late, with a maximum of $500. But it takes no account of the level of tax payable, in that, even if no tax is payable or a loss is incurred, the return nevertheless qualifies for a penalty.

         The imposition of penalties for late lodgment of returns when no tax is payable is seen by most observers as merely a revenue raiser. It should be dropped or, at the very least, deferred. Such measures do nothing to inspire confidence in the small business community. Companies with no tax bill which have not lodged returns or are late with those returns should not be penalised. It is for this reason that the coalition will be moving amendments to this measure. Small business does not need, nor can it afford, this extra impost.

I am sure that the shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), went into detail on most of them in his response. The bill amends a number of pieces of legislation, but my interest in this matter, and indeed the most controversial part of the bill before us, is the government's attempt to regulate employee share schemes.

         As has already been pointed out, this is the government's latest attempt—I think the third attempt—to regulate employee share schemes. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution to this debate put it particularly well when he said that, although in a lot of respects this is a technical bill, it does get to the heart of the fundamental philosophical differences between this government and the opposition in our approaches to a whole range of issues.

         When we talk about employee share schemes, we are focusing very strongly on relations between employers and employees. As the member for Curtin quite rightly pointed out, the fact is that the government is wedded, by virtue of its commitment to the trade union movement, to a system of industrial relations that is outmoded. The extent to which it will be able to facilitate or encourage employee share ownership will be limited by the unions' incapacity or unwillingness to allow the government to move too far down that track.

         From our point of view, the vehicle of employee share ownership is integral, crucial, to our whole approach to industrial relations. We want to see and encourage employers and employees to work together at the enterprise level. One important element of allowing and facilitating that is by virtue of employee share ownership; hence our attitude on this side, as has been stated by the shadow Treasurer, is that we are opposed to what the government now proposes. We will be moving amendments to reflect the opposition's approach, which I believe, quite clearly, is a much more enlightened approach to this whole issue, as is our approach to industrial relations, of which this forms one small part.

         The government clearly got it wrong the first time. It was caught out badly in its ham-fisted attempt to extend the fringe benefits tax to cover these arrangements. There were some elements of concern about the way the arrangements were being abused. They could have been fixed easily. Instead the government, buoyed by the success of its FBT—the fact is that FBT has grown and grown and, as a consequence, businesses have groaned and groaned under the impost of it—could not help itself and rushed into extending cover to these arrangements. These arrangements did not pass the Senate and were subsequently taken out of the legislation.

Backflips and unintended consequences have been a feature of this government over many years. It gets things wrong so often because it rushes into things, because it is pushed and because it is cornered philosophically so that, rather than do the right thing, it is forced to effectively do the less than optimal thing.

If that were not so, it would do something to overcome that particular problem.

         Legislation is currently in place which prevents pensioners and self-funded retirees from owning shares. The taking into account of unrealised capital gains has effectively forced many retired people and pensioners to sell their shares. Of course, the government's proposal that  deeming provisions be introduced from July 1996 will not improve that situation at all. The fact is that it will be very difficult for people to own share portfolios. Certainly that will be the effect of this legislation. People who have shares in businesses will have to pay tax and many of them will have to sell their shares in order to do that.

It is quite clear that the bureaucrats who put all this together have failed to understand all the issues involved with employee share plans. They have taken a very limited and restricted view rather than consider the whole picture which, as we have already said, encompasses industrial relations and a range of other issues. They have taken a very narrow approach in the proposals they have presented to the parliament today.

         Employee share plans have major implications for national savings. They are a valid plank in the approach to improving our national savings performance. As has been said in this place very often, our savings performance has been very poor historically and remains at historically low levels, not only for Australia but also compared to other OECD countries. It is interesting to look at a table that shows household savings rates as a percentage of disposable household income. The figure for Australia in 1993 was five per cent and, for 1994, is 6.7 per cent. The projection for 1995 is 5.3 per cent and, for 1996, 4.4 per cent. So there is a downward trend of household savings as a percentage of disposable household income. We compare unfavourably with other OECD countries. The percentage for Japan is 15 per cent; Germany, 11.6 per cent; France, 12.6 per cent; Italy, 14.1 per cent; and so on. Very few countries are performing worse than Australia by that measure.

         But perhaps a more important measure is gross national savings as a percentage of gross domestic product. That table is alarming and reveals the poor performance of Australia in this respect. The table that I have here shows the trend between 1977 and 1993. If we take the 1993 figures, the figure for Australian gross national savings as a percentage of GDP was 16.5 per cent. In 1992 it was 15.6 per cent. The interesting thing about this table is that it shows us being about the same level as Mexico. Mexico is way down the bottom. If you take the 1992 figures, the total OECD average is 19.4 per cent. In that year Australia's performance was 15.6 per cent. Mexico's was about the same, at 16.1 per cent—way below the OECD average. Very few countries are performing worse than Australia and Mexico. They are right at the bottom in terms of OECD performance in this table. It is quite concerning that Australia and Mexico seem to be comparable on so many scores. We heard yesterday, much to the chagrin of the government, that our balance of payments deficit level is once again at the bottom of the list, on a par with Mexico.

         In this context employee share plans have major implications for national savings. They are a vehicle to improve national savings and ought to be encouraged and facilitated. Yet to date the government has attempted, and is doing nothing different with this legislation, to effectively discourage employee share ownership purely because it has some philosophical problem because of the strictures placed upon it by its union masters in respect of embracing wholeheartedly by world standards an enlightened approach to employee share ownership and the implications that approach has for improving industrial relations in this country. Even if in the end it has a detrimental effect on the unions that should not be the motivation, but it is the motivation of this government to look after its union mates.

         The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is a fairly wide ranging tax amendment piece of legislation. It goes to a wide variety of matters. There should not be any great concern that from time to time bills such as this come before the House. Without going to the matter that is involved, I want to illustrate one aspect. What we are talking about in the part of the legislation dealing with sales tax exemption on UHF transmitters is that we have had in place a policy for equalisation but have found that certain things were not able to be achieved in the time frame that was first envisaged. Therefore, we are extending the exemption. This is an illustration of how from time to time different aspects of our tax law have to be amended because we want to ensure that consequences we expected from the changes are achievable. Sometimes time frames are paramount in what needs to be achieved.

         The one aspect of this piece of legislation that really caught my attention, and led to my being so bold as to put my name on the speakers list, was that dealing with superannuation guarantee and local government councillors. There was quite a campaign about the way in which the superannuation guarantee levy impinged upon elected councillors, impinged upon the allowances that elected councillors received.

         One aspect of the case was put to me by the local government in the city of Whittlesea, amongst other municipalities that came to me and sought my assistance. That aspect was that we managed to have the peculiar situation where there were apparently two definitions of `employee'—one for the purposes of income tax and one for the purposes of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act.

         I do not often do this but I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) about these matters, and he quite rightly took advice from the Australian Taxation Office. In replying to my office, he provided copies of determinations by the commissioner. I have to say that, in respect of the reply he sent to me in August 1993, I noted on my file copy `the logic escapes me'. It was even worse when we had a second go at it. We got a reply back in January 1994 and a member of my staff described the Assistant Treasurer's letter as a disgrace.

         I suppose we should not be so emotive about different aspects, and I am pleased to see that this legislation addresses some of the perceived problems. I think that is fair because the nature of the allowances received by local councillors previously, especially in the state of Victoria, was that they were in lieu of a reimbursement of expenses. They were hardly a salary.

         When those allowances were first put in place they were set at the level of $1,200, and that may have reached the level of either $2,000 or $3,000 by the time elected councillors were dismissed by the Victorian government and replaced by commissioners. It was really something that was basically a voluntary effort by those elected to those municipalities. I am pleased that the result of the amendments we see in this piece of legislation acknowledge that.

         I will not stray too far from the bill but I just want to make some comments. In Victoria, with the changes we are seeing in local government, there is under consideration a different role for elected councillors when we see a return to democratically elected councillors in March 1997. There is some contemplation that they will better represent part-time or full-time positions where the remuneration can be seen as a form of salary. I accept that, if that is the eventuation, salary will come within the ambit of all our tax laws, the income tax superannuation guarantee and the like.

         That move really does highlight the fact that local government in Victoria is going through a great transition. Unfortunately, that transition has led to commissioners being appointed for a period of nearly two years. That is a disappointment. I do not wish to reflect upon individual commissioners but, at the end of the day, they have been appointed by the state government and have been asked to achieve an agenda that the state government has put in place for them.

         It will be interesting to see whether the role of a local councillor is given a greater status. If during this period the state government is realistic in defining a wider role for local councillors, perhaps that will make the full-time positions more attractive to people and that would lead to those elected people getting a remuneration that more reflects a salary rather than a reimbursement of expenses.

         I understand that there has been the notion that the measures in place in this legislation are as a result of some capital `I' ideological bent of the government. I do not know that I really agree with that. I often have to reconcile in my own mind that this Labor government is a government of the modern Labor Party. It is the government of a Labor Party that is evolving. Whilst it might give me concern from time to time that that has meant there have been shifts in the ideological basis of a number of things the government does—the clearest example of that is the government's attitude in certain areas to public ownership—we do see that still it is a government that has many of the fine traditions of previous Labor governments, still it attempts to look at those issues of equity and fairness, and still it looks to the way it can try to achieve things that can be seen as being for the wider common good.

         Towards the end of his contribution, the honourable member for McPherson at least admitted that, in part, what we were trying to do with this amendment as it deals with employee share schemes was—to use his words—`to put a lid on any rorts that are going on'. Having come to a realisation that that is the intent, I find it a bit sad that, to my understanding, amendments proposed to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) in the consideration in detail stage are to completely delete schedule 2, which deals with all those matters to do with employee share schemes.

         I also understand that the drift of much of the case put by the coalition is that in some way this exemplifies some erroneous attitude that the government has to industrial relations. I would have thought that if we really read the intent of not only this amendment but also the basic legislation being amended, we would see that it gives scope for employees to take the option of investing in shares within the companies they are employed in. It is therefore a form by which workers can participate in their companies. It tightens the way in which any tax concession would be given. It gives options for the way in which the employee might decide to have the tax considerations of any discount he or she was to get on the share offer. That appears to be very fair.

         Likewise, I think it goes to the issue the honourable member for McPherson highlighted: national savings. I do not think we have to have the great argument, this argy-bargy, about the situation at the moment. We need to have the argument about how we are going to best address it. The FitzGerald inquiry clearly showed that we, as a nation, need to address the level of our national savings. Much of this year's budget provisions went to addressing that. The whole intent of what we are trying to achieve in the area of superannuation has as an underpinning tenet that it is a measure to improve our national savings position.

         The superannuation measures will have a twofold outcome. These measures will not only attempt to give individuals the opportunity to put in place arrangements that will best suit them in their retirement but also attempt to, through these collective efforts, achieve a pool of national savings that we as a nation need. I think that this is most important and it is something that this government has had high on its agenda for quite some time. It is something that this government recognises needs to be achieved.

         If we look at this Labor government's history on superannuation, we find that a national superannuation plan has always been high on its agenda.

         Former Prime Minister Menzies—someone I know the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has a high regard for—promised a national superannuation scheme in 1949, but for various reasons did not deliver. Figures from the Bureau of Statistics show that at the time of the Whitlam government in 1974 only 29 per cent of the employed population belonged to super schemes. On three occasions—notably, September 1970, April 1971 and September 1971—the Labor Party was defeated in the parliament on motions calling for the establishment of a national superannuation scheme. Consequently, in the 1972 budget then Treasurer Snedden announced such a scheme.

In March 1973, the Whitlam government established a national superannuation committee of inquiry, the Hancock committee. The task of ensuring that Australian workers have access to superannuation has taken a long time. After the experiences of some two decades, we now see that by using different mechanisms—mechanisms that were not envisaged at that time—we have gone a long way to achieving a commitment towards a broad superannuation scheme that is accessible to all workers.

         —The employee share ownership concept is about working together; it is about turning adversaries in the workplace into partners; it is about establishing property owning democracy; it is about giving workers what they do not always have—the dignity of a stake in their business. I imagine that, if the government was thinking this through properly, it would support everything that is being put by the opposition. I do not believe that many members opposite—there may be a few—have adopted their position out of ideology.

This issue has been debated three times now in this parliament, and not once has the government been able to come up with chapter and verse of the rorts that this legislation is supposed to eliminate.

         The government says it is in favour of employee share ownership, but its actions speak louder than its words. Under the tax regime that operated until last year, if an employee obtained shares at a concessional rate, then instead of paying tax on the value of that concession that tax could be deferred until the value of that share was realised. As I said, three times this government has tried to change the tax regime governing the issue of shares to employees. Twice it has been defeated. Three times it has got it wrong.

         As I said, the previous position was that the concessions on shares issued to employees only attracted tax when those shares were realised. Under the latest government scheme you can do it two ways: if you elect to pay the tax up front, then you can get a tax concession of $500 on the shares issued. To just consider for a moment how trivial and how petty this concession is, $500 worth of BHP shares is probably about 50 shares.

         The alternative is to take the shares and then pay tax in five years time. Let us consider this: an average worker is offered shares in his company by management. He thinks to himself, `Interest rates have just gone up three times in the last year. My mortgage is costing me more and more to carry each month, as the government's recovery peters out, as the economy hits the wall. My job is not as safe as it was.' That sort of worker is not going to be able to accept shares on a five-year deferred tax basis. If that worker does accept shares on that basis, what will happen is that he or she will take the shares, hold them for five years and then have to pay tax before having had a chance to enjoy their benefits.

Mr Deputy Speaker, how many companies will do that? The simple truth is: very few. What this legislation is doing is restricting the scope of employee share ownership.

The government, through the modern Labor Party, may have betrayed the Australian workers, but there are other people in this House who are prepared to take up the cudgels on behalf of the Australian people.

         —The legislation before the House is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The coalition is strongly of the view that the proposals put forward by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in relation to employee share ownership schemes are fundamentally flawed, and this is the subject I want to discuss in the House today.

         The concept of employee share ownership in terms of taxation support in this country goes back about 17 years. I think it is fair to say that, when the concept was initially developed, it had bipartisan support. Both government and opposition accepted the clear advantages which were to be found in having a mechanism by which people would be encouraged to make contributions through their income—normally by salary sacrifice type techniques—towards investing in the company which was employing them.

         The advantages underlying the concept of worker participation through share ownership can best be described as follows: they reward good performance and the attainment of specific business objectives; they give the recipients a positive incentive to increase their company's productivity and profitability; they increase industrial harmony; they help to create a greater awareness of the company's operations; they encourage greater employee identification with shareholder interests and with the company's interests; they assist in remunerating staff properly and in line with overall market conditions; they can keep the fixed component of wage costs at a lower level than would otherwise be the case; they are a motivational tool which is good for morale; they can inspire greater loyalty to the company; they can provide another form of saving for retirement and they can do so without restrictions applying to conventional superannuation; they are tax effective; and they can help to attract and retain key staff.

         This mechanism was developed initially in the United States which is regarded, somewhat euphemistically, as the home of capitalism. What we have seen in recent times—on three occasions in fact—are attempts by this Labor government to tinker with the system, not to improve it, not to make worker participation schemes through share ownership more attractive; but to fiddle around the edges, with the effect that we are firmly of the view that it will make this proposition less attractive than has been the case in the past. Putting it quite simply: the proposals put forward in this legislation are fundamentally flawed.

         The Treasurer's amendments will question and threaten the viability of current schemes and restrict the potential for the future expansion of employee share ownership in Australia. That is something which the opposition regards as fundamentally important in regard to not only the role it should be able to play in the overall need to increase national savings but also participation—that is the most important word of all—shared ownership, involvement or the ability of the workers of Australia, regardless of whether they are executives, white-collar workers or workers on the floor of the factory, to feel that the success of the enterprise to which they make such a real contribution can be reflected not just in their salaries and wages but also in their being part owners of the enterprise to which they have made such a major commitment.

         This is the third attempt in the last 13 months by the government to deal with this issue. We regard it as a third failure. The essence of the problem seems to be that the government believes that there are new schemes in place which are rorting the system, which are an effective means of tax avoidance and which therefore should be closed off. These schemes have been referred to within the taxation and accounting industry as `new age' schemes.

         We in the opposition will be the first to agree that, if there is evidence that people are using these mechanisms to avoid taxation in an illegal sense, they should then be stopped. For example, if there is a means by which people can nominally buy shares in a company or in a trust fund which, in effect, can then be used to buy them overseas trips, to buy them boats, to buy them smart sports cars or even to buy them homes or real estate, one could legitimately say that was a gross misuse of the principles underlined in the original legislation which allowed these schemes in the first place. Of course, we would oppose such propositions.

         What has been made clear in this whole debate is the inability of the government to specifically identify these problems and then go about changing the law in an effective way to stop them. Instead of that, it is effectively changing the system in a way that will radically transform the whole basis upon which decisions are made by companies—often outside Australia—as to whether or not they are willing to continue to provide worker share ownership schemes to the benefit of their employees.

         We believe that the government needs to encourage the distribution of shares right across the work force. We want employees to have the opportunity to have a stake in the businesses which employ them. That is really the basic difference between where we stand on this issue and where the current Labor government stands. We want as many employees as possible to own shares through employee share schemes. Clearly, the Labor Party wants to discourage them from owning shares by introducing new and extremely unfavourable tax treatment. We believe that Australia must encourage and increase employee share ownership to address our critically low level of national savings, as well as being a mechanism for encouraging a further lift in productivity and improved harmony within the workplace.

         There are many aspects of the proposal which we find unacceptable. The proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefits are realised. The five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee even acquires a share. This leaves employees with an unfunded tax liability well into the future. The qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are far too tight. There is no refund of tax paid on options that may lapse. The valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options. Most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed up-front.

         The sad fact is simply that today Australia is a derivative economy. Today the vast majority of the work force involved in major companies are employed by international corporations which have in place overseas worker participation schemes which they want to make available to their employees in this country. Surely, that is in their interests. It is a mechanism by which we can ensure that, while companies may be foreign owned, at least Australians working for them will have the capacity to make a contribution and to gain dividends—from their labour and the result of the success of that company internationally.

         One proposal put forward by the government is a $500 discount for employees taking shares. The facts are that most people will not even qualify for those shares because they have to take the shares in the year in which they were issued; they cannot see them as an advance which can be utilised later when they have the funds to pay for them; shares should have no conditions for forfeiture; you cannot dispose of them before five years of employment; and the discount is restricted to people who have been employed for 24 months, rather than 12 months as previously. There should be discounts for employees taking shares. They should be open to all employees and they should have the option of holding on to those shares and getting the discount at the same time.

         The second fundamental flaw in the government's approach is the proposal that taxation liability on shares or options at the end of five years will arise whether or not those options are exercised or you have those shares. That is patently absurd. If you have not exercised those options, you may find yourself having to pay a tax liability for something that you never take up. There is no prospect for a refund in the eventuality that you do not take them up or that the options have lapsed.

         What is also fundamentally flawed in this proposal is that many international companies which operate worldwide, as I have said, have employees around the world involved in share ownership plans and most of those international plans allow a 10-year period before any tax liability falls due on the options. But that is not what has been offered. This legislation is limited to a five-year period. That means that Australian law, by changing the goalposts at this stage, is effectively cutting out of the action thousands of Australian employees who otherwise would have access to the international worker participation and share ownership plans of their foreign employers. There is simply no logic whatsoever in applying such a law.

         Any adverse effect upon employees of international companies posted in Australia will obviously arise out of the proposed legislation.

         The class of employee of an international corporation, through international practice for many years, has involved these various forms of employee share acquisition schemes.

         We welcome the removal of the FBT impost appearing in previous proposals—that is, the last three proposals of the government—nevertheless, the current proposals are clearly inadequate, mainly in the following areas: the conditions for qualification are too stringent and do not recognise a wide variety of employment practices and conditions; the five-year rule is too short and should be based on the period permitted under the law of the country of issue of the shares or rights, with a maximum period of, say, 10 years; the lack of an adjustment or refund where an option lapses or is unexercised is inequitable; and the valuation rules are clearly unrealistic, because employee options are usually non-transferable and non-tradeable.

         I conclude by making the point that we in the opposition believe the worker participation schemes are important. They  can be a mixed blessing if they are not properly designed. But the practice of the last 17 years or so demonstrates that it can only be to the benefit of Australia and Australian employees and employers to have in place a rational, sensible scheme of proposals which lock in international practice on the one hand and domestic practice on the other. With regard to employee schemes, whether you are the employee of an international corporation or whether you are the employee of a national corporation in Australia, the rules must remain consistent in both cases.

         Unfortunately, after 17 years of practice, after three attempts to change the rules in recent times, the government has still, regrettably, failed to make it worth while. The point needs to be made that Vince FitzGerald, in his eminent report of last year on national savings, made the point that there is a potential to increase revenue by some $500 million a year under the old scheme, provided it is administered effectively.

         I see no advantage whatsoever to Australia, or to the employees who have previously been covered by these schemes, for the government to now change the goalposts at a time when it is quite clear that the proposals it is putting forward are not going to achieve the ends it wishes, but will simply reduce revenue, reduce the capacity of companies to want to offer these schemes and share participation arrangements. Consequently, this will directly result in a diminution in the quantum of Australian ownership of foreign shares of companies that operate in this country and will do absolutely nothing to increase Australia's capacity to be more independent in terms of capital raising, both here and overseas.

The policy of members of the opposition is to oppose—in the words of the member for O'Connor—but not to put forward any positive proposals. They are not doing it today. Today they have put up some amendments which, in effect, would just maintain the status quo. We know that the status quo is highly tilted towards executives getting the benefits of the employee share acquisition schemes provisions. The government wants to make sure that all employees get the benefits of these schemes. That is why we have brought the amendments to the legislation in. It is well recognised throughout the industry that the existing legislation is being abused. If we accept the amendments of the opposition, that will continue.

We know that in a lot of public companies the main benefits of this scheme are going to the executives. I rule out the companies like the BHPs: they do have schemes in place in which all employees can participate. It is not as if the government has not listened to some of the criticisms that are around the place. We made some changes to the provisions when they were here last year. We have made sure that FBT does not apply and that the tax will be paid by the individual but that the tax can be deferred for five years. Currently there is no requirement for the benefits to go to all employees, and mainly the executives get it.

         I heard a couple of the opposition speakers talk as though the opposition stands for all employees getting the benefits of these shares. The practical effect of its amendments is exactly the opposite, and the opposition knows it from experience. It is not as though we are talking academically here. We know what is happening in the marketplace now. We are saying that these benefits should go to all employees. We have made sure that that happens.

They do not know where they are going. It is apparent that they do not know where they are going because all they are doing is opposing. As the honourable member for O'Connor is honest enough to admit, it is their policy to oppose, but not to put up constructive alternatives. The amendments I will be moving will make sure that all employees of a company get access to the benefit of the employee share acquisition scheme, which is something the opposition talks about but, as practice shows, fails to deliver on.

         In relation to the amendments to item 1, amendment 1 inserts new section 24AYA. This section will disallow superannuation contributions of certain privatised STBs to the extent that those contributions are in respect of unfunded liabilities that accrue during the period from 1 July 1995 until the STB is privatised. Amendment 1 is part of a revenue safeguarding package. The package consists of restrictions on the use of losses and certain deductions of state and territory bodies, STBs, which are remaining in the Commonwealth tax net because they will soon be privatised.

        The government is aware that tax planners have already developed one arrangement which will ensure that shares or rights provided under an employee share scheme, which would otherwise be taxed without any concession, will now be treated concessionally. In its simplest form, this arrangement makes selected executives of a holding company employees in an investment company. Those employees are also granted shares in the subsidiary. The subsidiary may hold shares in unrelated companies.

         —I indicate that the coalition will not be opposing the amendments which have been moved by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), but we will be opposing schedule 2 after it has been amended. The reason we will be opposing schedule 2, to reiterate our position, is that we believe the government's propositions and proposals are fundamentally flawed and that, in fact, rather than aiding employee share ownership in Australia, the provisions in this bill actually threaten the viability of current share schemes and restrict the potential for future expansion of employee share ownership in Australia.

         This is the third attempt by the government to deal with employee share ownership in 13 months, and it is its third failure. The justification for much of the changes contained in this bill, and even in the amendments which are now being moved by the Assistant Treasurer, is, firstly, that we want to bring employee share ownership to the availability of all employees in Australia and, secondly, that there are some rorts and abuses of the system.

         You would think that if it were the case that there are rorts and abuses of the system, the Assistant Treasurer and other members of the government would be able to come into this place and signal, in chapter and verse, the rorts and the abuses that are alleged to be occurring. But when we ask them to do so, there is a deafening silence which crosses the length and breadth of this nation. All we get is this general assertion that it is known in the industry that there are some rorts and abuses.

         When the government is making changes to the taxation laws of this country based on the assertion that there are rorts and abuses of the system, it is incumbent upon it to set out what those particular rorts and abuses are, rather than make this general allegation, implying as it does that those persons and companies involved in employee share ownership are somehow rorting the system. The companies involved include some of the most major companies in Australia—the BHPs of Australia and the Labor government's former icon, the Commonwealth Bank, which it is now selling off. Qantas is about to make offers of this nature in its share release prospectus to the general public and as part of its general transitional arrangements. There is simply no real evidence of what the government alleges.

         The reason we oppose this particular measure is that there are aspects of the proposal which are simply going to work against employees gaining, in any real sense, a share of the company in which they are employed. For example, the proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefit is realised. The five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving employees with an unfunded tax liability. The qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are too tight. There is no refund on tax paid on options that lapse. The valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options. Finally, most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed up front.

         I hear the Assistant Treasurer saying that we do not have policies. Of course, it piques the government at the present time that the policies of the government are somehow being challenged when flaws are shown to exist in them. What does the government expect? Does it expect that in relation to every piece of legislation, even though industry groups say it is flawed—that happened in relation to this piece of legislation—we are going to get up here and cheer and say, `Bravo, this is a great piece of legislation?' Of course not. We are going to carry out our responsibilities to bring to the notice of the government and the people of Australia the flaws that exist in legislation, such as those that exist in this piece. As I said, the coalition will not be opposing the further amendments which are being made to the schedule, but we will oppose the schedule itself.

        Part of this bill gives rollover relief from accrued capital gains and losses where certain superannuation funds merge. The amendments allow the trustee of a transferor fund that merges on or after 1 July 1994 to roll over any capital gains losses that would be realised as a result of the merger where a number of conditions apply. In particular, two of these conditions are of concern to the coalition. The first is that the merger take place between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997. The second is that the merging funds be qualifying superannuation funds.

         These two provisions relate to the amendments which have been circulated in the name of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). In particular, the first amendment deals with the timing of mergers. It is the belief of the coalition that the application of the rollover relief ought not be restricted simply to mergers which occur between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997. If this is an amendment to the legislation, which in principle is desirable—and that would seem to be the case because the government is moving this way—then why restrict it to mergers between funds that occur only between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997? Therefore, the amendment which has been moved seeks to make that time for merger open indefinitely.

         The second amendment which is being moved relates to the condition that the merging funds are qualifying superannuation funds. We seek to amend the definition in the legislation because the effect of this bill is to fail to extend the relief which is provided to small superannuation funds. By specifically excluding superannuation funds with less than five members, the legislation neglects some of the funds which are most affected. Approximately 80 per cent of superannuation funds are excluded funds and are not eligible for the rollover relief which is provided in this bill.

         Given that so many funds—about 80 per cent—are excluded by the provisions of this bill, our amendment seeks to allow those funds which have five or less members to be included in the provisions that the government seeks to implement by way of this bill. They are the reasons that the amendments have been moved.

         —In relation to amendment No. 2, the proposal would give unlimited extension of the capital gains tax relief for merging superannuation funds. The capital gains tax relief is designed to encourage superannuation funds to merge so there are fewer and more efficient funds. The coalition agrees with us that this should happen. The government will not be supporting the amendment.

         I point out that no other unrelated taxpayers who merge their businesses get this relief. This measure is designed to reduce the small amounts problem by trying to encourage the merger of funds so there are fewer and more efficient funds. It is not equitable to extend this relief permanently. In the government's view, three years is long enough to allow these mergers, where they will take place, to take place.

        This amendment has been circulated to honourable members in the name of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). The provisions of schedule 4 in the bill relate to local government councillors. The bill seeks to amend the definition of `salary or wages' and `employee, employer' in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to ensure a number of things—namely, that persons in the capacity of a local government councillor are excluded from the definition of `employee'; that members of an eligible local governing body are included in the definition of `employee'; and payments made to local government councillors, other than those who are members of an eligible local governing body, are excluded from the definition of `salary or wages'.

         The amendment seeks to ensure that payments received by local government councillors in the course of their duties are exempt from the scope of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act, but that payments to members of eligible local governing bodies will continue to be subject to the requirements of the superannuation guarantee legislation. Currently the remuneration allowances of members of local government bodies are exempt from the PAYE collection system, unless the body unanimously elects to be treated as an eligible local government body.

         This amendment applies to assessments of super guarantee shortfall for the year beginning on 1 July 1993 and later years. The government formally announced this measure on 26 June 1994 through the then Minister for Local Government, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), who wrote to local government councils in July 1992 advising that, as far as local government elected members were concerned, the new superannuation arrangements would only apply to councillors in receipt of salaries. However, the amendments are only retrospective to 1 July 1993, whilst the superannuation guarantee levy commenced on 1 July 1992.

         The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended in June 1992 that the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 be amended by the government to ensure that local government councillors who receive salary or wages are covered by the superannuation guarantee while other local government councillors not be covered by the superannuation guarantee. We have criticised the application of the superannuation guarantee legislation to local government councillors and the failure of the government to enact legislation to give effect to the letter of the former Minister for Local Government.

         In September 1993 Senator Macdonald introduced a private member's bill, which passed through the Senate, with the same objectives as the current provisions but dating back to 1 July 1992. The effect of this amendment is to remove or omit the date `1 July 1993' and substitute for it `1 July 1992'. Given that that would then be consistent with the introduction of the superannuation guarantee, we believe that this is an amendment which would then clarify the situation completely and place the situation of local government councillors on a consistent footing with the date of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy.

         —The effect of this amendment would be to bring forward by one year the exemption from the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act of payments to local government councillors. The government will not support this amendment. The first point to be made is that the amendment will favour employers who did not comply with the super guarantee legislation. Secondly, amendments will mean that super funds have to refund contributions already made. I am informed that there would be costs involved—for example, they may have to amend trust deeds. Thirdly, the change was announced on 18 April 1994, as the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) said, so the councils knew not to make contributions for the 1993-94 year.

         —The other very important issue which needs to be addressed in the context of this amendment is the effect which the government's rule is having not just on local government councillors but on doctors and other professional people who have been caught up in what could best be described as an unforeseen consequence. Let me give an example: if doctors have a private practice—and have consequently made private superannuation arrangements—and have also worked in a hospital, the effect of the current arrangement is that they are caught by what I call the 10 per cent rule. That is, if 10 per cent or more of their income is related specifically to the activities undertaken in a professional capacity in a hospital, it effectively means that their private superannuation is negatived because they are included in the superannuation guarantee arrangements.

         The effect that this has had on many doctors—especially anaesthetists and various specialised service providers—has been enormous. It is clearly inequitable. I hasten to add that it does not apply only to those people working under contract in a hospital. There is a perception that this applies only when a person actually has a contract to provide services in a hospital environment. I am reliably informed by representations which I have received that it affects an anaesthetist who is under contract to a surgeon to facilitate an operational procedure. The anaesthetist does not, therefore, have a legal relationship per se with the hospital but is also caught up in this situation.

         The implications of that are quite wide ranging. I certainly urge the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, to review this matter. As we have suggested, to make the commencing date 1 July 1992 instead of 1 July 1993 would be a serious attempt to overcome what is becoming a serious anomaly. The 10 per cent rule as it currently applies affects a wider selection of people than just local government councillors. It covers a whole range of professional services—especially in the medical area—which are being provided. I suggest to the minister that this rule is having an effect which can only be described as an unforeseen circumstance. I think the government's actions are grotesquely unfair.

        These amendments, which were circulated in the name of the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), relate to the provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) pertaining to late lodgment penalties. One of the provisions of the bill is to introduce a new regime of penalties for late lodgment of income tax returns. For relevant entities and instalment taxpayers, a flat penalty system applies. They will be liable for a penalty at the rate of $25 per week for the period where they are late in lodging an income tax return, subject to a maximum penalty of $500—that is, equal to 20 weeks—regardless of the level of tax payable; that is, a penalty will be applied if there is a late lodgment of the return even if it subsequently comes to light that there was no tax payable or a loss was incurred.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Taxpayers affected by this provision include: companies, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, pooled superannuation funds, trustees of corporate unit trusts and trustees of public trading trusts. The late payment penalties will continue to apply on the basis of the amount of tax outstanding. The commissioner has a discretion to remit the late lodgment penalty and the objection procedures of part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act apply. These late penalties consist of a penalty tax at eight per cent per annum and a penalty interest at the statutory rate—for the period January 1995 to June 1995—of 10.8 per cent, which is calculated on a daily basis from the date tax becomes due and payable.

         The imposition of penalties for late lodgment of returns where no tax is payable has been criticised by many as a revenue raiser. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, has called for this provision to be dropped or, at least, deferred by the government. It claims that the provision will place unacceptable burdens on small business. Apparently, the Australian Taxation Office has argued that the penalty was needed to assist in the improvement of its statistical collection. Companies with no tax bill which have not lodged returns may now be penalised. This may lead to increased compliant costs to lodge these returns.

        Basically, we are saying that if there is no tax payable then there ought not be a penalty imposed, or if there is a situation where a loss has been incurred and there is a late lodgment then these automatic penalties should not apply. For that reason, we are moving these amendments to the legislation.

         —Amendments Nos (5) and (6) propose to exclude from the late lodgment penalty relevant entities and instalment taxpayers that do not have a taxable income; that is, loss companies. The amendment is at odds with what the government is trying to achieve. The penalty is in response to problems the Commissioner of Taxation has experienced with loss taxpayers not lodging returns on time.

         The information contained in returns is necessary for the purpose of providing data to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as well as enabling the Taxation Office to manage its compliance programs. If companies and superannuation funds that did not derive taxable income were not subject to late lodgment penalties then there would be no administrative sanctions to enforce lodgment.

         As with amendment No. (7): the amendment proposed is to delay the application of the late lodgment penalty in respect of relevant entities and instalment taxpayers so that it applies to the 1995-96 income tax returns. The earliest due date for lodgment by this group of taxpayers is 1 February 1996, with the exception of taxpayers on substituted accounting periods. Small companies required to lodge by this date have been given a two-month extension—that is, from 1 December 1995 to 1 February 1996—by the commissioner for the lodgment of returns. We think taxpayers are being given sufficient warning of the proposed penalty. The easiest way, of course, for companies to avoid the penalty is to lodge their tax returns on time. The government will not be supporting the amendments.

        The bill contains a transitional credit ground which covers the period from 1 July 1994 until the bill receives royal assent, when the exemption comes into force. Amendments (24) to (27) will amend the existing credit ground and insert a new transitional credit ground to deny access to sales tax credits to state and territory bodies which are listed in regulations and which are intended to be taxable. These are technical amendments to ensure that the provisions will operate as intended.

        The purpose of this bill is to bring the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, QIDC, under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. QIDC is a financial institution which is wholly owned by the Queensland government and which undertakes commercial lending to primary, secondary and tertiary industry within the state of Queensland. While in recent years it has sought to adhere to Reserve Bank standards, QIDC has not been formally supervised by the Reserve Bank.

         The Queensland government has recently corporatised QIDC and as part of this exercise is seeking to enhance the accountability of QIDC by enabling it to be brought under Reserve Bank supervision. This bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to bring QIDC under Reserve Bank prudential supervision. To this end, the Queensland government has recently referred its banking powers, with respect to QIDC, to the Commonwealth. Specifically, this bill includes QIDC within the definition of a bank in section 5 of the Banking Act 1959, thereby establishing a legislative basis for Reserve Bank supervision of QIDC. This will ensure that QIDC follows Reserve Bank requirements and is subject to the supervision of the Reserve Bank in relation to prudential matters.

         The Commonwealth government endorses Reserve Bank supervision of QIDC. As a substantial commercial lender, QIDC effectively operates as a business bank and its formal supervision by the Reserve Bank is entirely appropriate. Such supervision will help to ensure that QIDC remains financially sound and, accordingly, will help to underpin the security of the financial sector more generally.

         —As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has indicated, this bill is before the House because the Queensland government has sought to enhance the accountability of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation by enabling it to be brought under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. That is being facilitated in the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill by listing the QIDC under the definition in section 5 of the Banking Act 1959. This establishes a legislative basis for the Reserve Bank supervision of the QIDC.

         The bill includes provisions complementary to Queensland legislation, under which the Queensland government transferred its constitutional banking power, as it relates specifically to the QIDC, to the Commonwealth government. The purpose of this measure is to ensure that QIDC follows the requirements of, and is subject to, the supervision of the Reserve Bank in relation to prudential matters.

         I indicate that the coalition does not oppose this legislation. However, there are two or three concerns which I wish to raise in the House. The first matter I wish to raise is the provision of prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank itself. If it is expected, or told to Queensland people, that this somehow provides a degree of insurance or immunity for the activities of the QIDC, then one only needs to look at the report of the Reserve Bank itself to illustrate that that is a limited immunity or a limited insurance which is provided. For example, the Reserve Bank stated in its annual report for the year ending 30 June 1991:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Prudential supervision does not have as an objective the immunisation of banks from the risk of loss.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Managers and shareholders should factor the inevitability of the economic cycle into their decision-making, and they must pay the price for errors of judgment and carelessness.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his remarks to the Queensland parliament, the Queensland Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, pointed to Reserve Bank supervision as an insurance against loss by taxpayers. To suggest that somehow prudential supervision will, by itself, provide an insurance policy against any loss that could be incurred by the QIDC as a bank and an insurance against loss by Queensland taxpayers is somewhat misleading. One has only to look at what happened to banks in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia to see that the ultimate insurance for such activities is not the Reserve Bank through its prudential supervision but, in fact, the taxpayers, the constituents, of those states themselves.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second matter I wish to raise is the activities of the bank and what seemed to be suggested to the people of Queensland that the QIDC would be able to do. If honourable members look at the explanation of the Queensland QIDC bill, they will see that the Treasurer of Queensland, Mr De Lacy, told the Queensland parliament that the QIDC would not be able to call itself a bank because:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . it is not able to fully perform as a bank in that it cannot provide retail banking facilities or provide finance for what are essentially owner-occupied homes.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Although QIDC would gain the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank, the State legislation precludes the Commonwealth of Australia from requiring QIDC to possess a banking authority to carry out the business of banking.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Queensland Treasurer summed up by saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This option means that although QIDC is defined as a `bank' under the Banking Act 1959—
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the Commonwealth act—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        it is not authorised to operate as a bank in the wider sense because it does not have a banking authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        This bank, if one looks at the speech that has just been made by the Assistant Treasurer, is able to carry out a whole range of banking activities. I quote the Assistant Treasurer's remarks prior to mine in this chamber today:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        QIDC is a financial institution which is wholly owned by the Queensland government and which undertakes commercial lending to primary, secondary and tertiary industry within the state of Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no restriction on the activities of the QIDC and as a bank it can carry out a full range of banking functions. So for Mr De Lacy to indicate to the people of Queensland that somehow prudential supervision and the passage of this legislation and the complementary legislation in the Queensland parliament are going to restrict the activities of the QIDC is simply misleading.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If one takes it further, the QIDC will, under the very provisions of this legislation, be able to entitle itself and call itself a bank in any other part of Australia. So anybody who would be seeking to invest or to have some operation in relation to the QIDC, for example a resident of New South Wales, Victoria or any of the other states, would for all intents and purposes and under the terms of this legislation be dealing with a bank constituted as such under the authority of this bill and the authority of the complementary bill in Queensland.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It was somewhat misleading for the Treasurer of Queensland to suggest to the Queensland parliament and to the people of Queensland that this would in some way restrict the activities of the QIDC. In fact, the passage of this very legislation has the opposite effect: it gives the
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          QIDC a wide range of banking authority under the Commonwealth and under the legislation of Queensland as well.

         The third matter I want to raise is what this means in terms of the direction of banking itself. It is interesting that in some respects this indicates that the Queensland government is moving in a direction which is opposite to that being taken by state governments elsewhere in Australia and, in relation to the proposal by the Commonwealth to sell its share in the Commonwealth Bank, opposite to that which the Commonwealth has taken. We see other states getting out of the business of banking. The Commonwealth is doing that in its budget proposals for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Yet under the direction of the Goss government it seems to be moving through this legislation in the opposite direction, namely, by expanding the operation of the QIDC and turning it into a more fully fledged bank than it has operated as at present.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is curious and intriguing because the Premier of Queensland has said in parliament that he did not resile from the position that `state governments should not be in the banking and insurance business'. Yet in an indirect way this does involve the state government of Queensland in the banking and insurance business. Whilst there is nothing to suggest that the activities of the QIDC are anything but carried out in the most professional and most competent manner, it is a curious matter that we have a different direction being taken here in relation to banking by a state than has been taken by the other states in Australia after the disastrous occurrences with banks such as Tricontinental and others, and different from the direction which is being taken by the Commonwealth in relation to the Commonwealth Bank itself. Apart from those concerns, the opposition will not be opposing this bill.

         The Queensland Industry Development Corporation commenced operations in July 1986. The main functions of the QIDC are the provision of financial services to Queensland industry and the administration in Queensland of certain federal and state business and rural assistance schemes, including the rural adjustment scheme, the natural disasters assistance scheme, the small business debt assistance scheme and the rural housing scheme. The QIDC provides a broad range of products, including development capital, interest rate swaps, bridging loans, mortgages, commercial bills and investment services. It is a very important institution for the economic welfare of Queensland and Queensland businesses.

         As of 30 June 1994, the QIDC had net assets of $151.335 million and total operating revenue of $248.444 million. Government business enterprises in Queensland are currently undergoing a process of corporatisation. The reform and restructuring of the QIDC is a part of that process. It should be noted that the administration of the QIDC under the Goss Labor government is in marked contrast to the administration during its formative years under the National Party regime that we, thankfully, threw out of office on 2 December 1989.

         The QIDC was a potential financial disaster when it was taken over by the Goss Labor government in December of 1989. If it had not been for the sound administration that came in on 2 December 1989 and the very sound administration by the Goss Labor government of the QIDC, the problems that were alluded to in terms of other state financial institutions could very well have been visited upon the QIDC.

Recently, on the border between my electorate and that of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), a national relay service was established to assist deaf people and people with communication difficulties.

The QIDC, as we affectionately know it in Queensland, commenced operation in July 1986 under its new name. Prior to that it had a role as a development bank in Queensland. One of the great things about the QIDC is that it has always kept its base out there in rural Australia. As we have seen only recently, the major commercial banks are continuing to withdraw their presence in a physical sense from rural Australia, while the QIDC has been expanding its operations, particularly in rural Queensland.

In future, the void that is being created by the withdrawal of the major commercial banks from rural Queensland may be filled by banks such as the Queensland Industry Development Corporation.

         This bill is a stark reminder of the duplicity of the Goss government and why Queenslanders should not trust it with their future on July 15. On repeated occasions the Queensland Labor Party, both in and out of government, gave cast-iron guarantees that the traditional role of the QIDC would be respected, and that its prime purpose would be to promote the interests and development of Queensland. On repeated occasions the Premier has stated that the QIDC would not become a bank, with all the implications that this would carry for the bank's operations. Premier Goss gave these assurances as recently as last year, when introducing legislation complementary to that now before this House. He said that the QIDC would not become another bank.

         As a result of this legislation, this great Queensland institution will be subject to federal banking controls. The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) was earlier referring to the corruption or the maladministration of the previous conservative administration in Queensland. He failed to tell the House that the Queensland government inherited a very well managed state. The finances were in excellent order, and the QIDC was a bank that was fulfilling a role. We only have to look at Labor administrations in Victoria and in South Australia to find that a bank under a Labor administration in Victoria cost the taxpayers $2 billion to bail out and in South Australia, notwithstanding the fact that it was under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. The cost to the taxpayers was $2.2 billion. No such evidence of this sort of failure within a state controlled lending institution can be levelled at the former administration in Queensland. One can witness also the former administrations of Western Australia and Tasmania.

         The Queensland Industry Development Corporation, as I said earlier, has a proud past and I hope it has a proud future in developing the state. One of the great visionary projects which have been promoted by independent commentators and investors recently has been the building of the great inland rail bridge between Brisbane and Melbourne via the inland towns of Goondiwindi and Moree, through Narrabri and the heart of the Murray-Darling Basin. Such a bridge could well mean the further development of value adding industries where 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural production comes from.

         The QIDC could well play a role in the development of that visionary scheme, particularly through the provision of finance. Queensland and the port of Brisbane are so near to the great Murray-Darling basin river system where 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural production comes from. It is those sorts of projects which the QIDC and other development organisations could well look at as projects which would bring benefits not only to Queensland, to the people who live along that rail link, but also to the nation as a whole.

In answer to a question from the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) the other day whether free banking services would still be available under a fully privatised Commonwealth Bank to almost 4.5 million pensioners, students and veterans, the Treasurer failed to give an assurance to this House and to those people—those 4.5 million people, those low income families who bank now with the Commonwealth Bank and those who may have a housing loan—that they will continue to have free banking services once it is a fully commercial bank and there is no longer any ownership by the Commonwealth.

It is one of the fundamental services that any community needs. It is not good enough to say that with modern technology you are going to be able to replace banks with plastic cards and electronic funds transfer and that this will be able to be a service that will be understood and be completely adequate for the people who live and work in rural and remote Queensland.

         —Listening to the previous speaker and shadow minister, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), speak on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995, you would think that there were no problems with the QIDC when the Labor government came into power in Queensland in 1989. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that in 1989 the Goss government was faced with a real problem, in that the QIDC presented a great risk to the taxpayers of Queensland at that time. If the situation had been allowed to continue, as happened in other states, the Queensland taxpayers would have been required to pick up the tab for years of National Party mismanagement of the QIDC.

         The Goss government had to do something about that and in 1990 it got an independent academic, Mr John Polichronis, to undertake a report into the QIDC. The report that Mr Polichronis gave was damning of the previous National Party government and damning of its administration of the QIDC. It showed evidence of political interference in commercial matters under the National Party government. As well, it showed cases of commercial conflict of interest by the National Party appointed directors and staff of the board of the QIDC. It also gave evidence of lack of board leadership and abuse of schemes administered by the relevant division of the QIDC.

         We should not be surprised about that, given the record of that government. That was the government that would not even introduce a public accounts committee into the parliament of Queensland. It would not even have parliamentary scrutiny of any government institutions. That was the government, as was said earlier, that operated by the brown paper bag. If you wanted to become a knight, that required a financial transaction with the previous National Party government. If you wanted a knighthood, you sent some money in a brown paper bag to Bjelke-Petersen House. That was the sort of financial transaction that was highlighted by the Fitzgerald royal commission. So that is the sort of government the people of Queensland had before 1989. That is the sort of government that was highlighted by the Fitzgerald royal commission and that is the sort of government that was highlighted by Mr Polichronis in his report on the QIDC. So, far from the picture that was painted by the shadow minister, who is at the table, the QIDC was in a mess. Not only that; potentially it was in the same situation as those other unfortunate financial institutions in the southern states.

I can assure them they will not be in government after the middle of next month, but I suspect that they think they have a chance.

         —The honourable member says that is rubbish. It is certainly the situation that after that report by Mr Polichronis in 1990 the Goss government acted to reform the QIDC. One of the reforms was the corporatisation of the QIDC. The second reform was to bring the QIDC under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. There was an option of bringing the QIDC into the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision, but that institution looks more at smaller banks and building societies and it was considered more appropriate that the Reserve Bank be the supervisor.

         It is very significant to note that the Goss government has led the way in terms of national reform of building societies and credit unions. The national financial institutions scheme is the model scheme for other states and territories and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission has its headquarters in Brisbane. So there is no doubt that there has been significant recognition of the Queensland government's achievement in this area. Queensland is widely recognised as having the strongest financial position of all the Australian states and, indeed, its financial position is unrivalled amongst its competitors in the Asia-Pacific region. The Natwest capital market report,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        That is the true situation. Of course, this unique financial position has given business in Queensland a huge competitive advantage. While other states use on average $25 in every $100 of their own source revenue in servicing their $75 million debt load, Queensland actually earns net interest income.

         Queensland is the only state to be debt free. The combined debt of the other states and territories is about $75 billion. The Goss government has completely eliminated the debt of $4.2 billion inherited from the previous National Party government. Indeed, by June 1996, the Queensland government is expected to have net assets of $1.6 billion. So let us not hear any of the nonsense that has been bandied about here that somehow the Goss government does not have a good financial record in Queensland.

         Getting back to the QIDC, the QIDC has been substantially reformed in other areas. The government schemes that I previously referred to, the government schemes that were previously manipulated by the National Party government, have been removed from the QIDC and are now administered by the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority. The QIDC is now run by an independent professional board—no more National Party cronies on the board. It is an independent board that is running the scheme very well. I would not want the House to think that, by changing its emphasis and transferring the government schemes to the administration of the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority, there is a neglect of the rural sector. I think there was some suggestion in the previous speaker's remarks that that was the case. The proof is in the figures, because lending to rural producers from the QIDC increased from $250 million in 1986 to over $1,000 million in 1995.

         In some ways, that is what happened in the southern states in relation to other institutions. It was not quite the same thing but, clearly, there were inappropriate loans in the southern states. The difference with Queensland is this: the people in Victoria and South Australia were overly generous with their loans, but there was never any suggestion that there was political interference in terms of who got the loans; and it is very clear indeed that the QIDC, pre-1989, was subject to political interference. That is why this legislation is before the House: if we are to avoid that sort of situation, we have got to have proper supervision. The Goss government, with obvious cooperation from the Keating government, has provided that supervision. I have no difficulty in supporting the legislation before the House.

It will be registered under section 5 of the Banking Act. No amount of obfuscation by the Queensland Treasurer, no amount of quick sidestepping, can avoid that issue. It will be a bank. The fact that it will be a bank should be of concern to many Queenslanders because, clearly, governments do not run banks very well. In fact, what this amounts to is the people of Queensland signing a blank cheque for the Goss government, and many Queenslanders would want to think very carefully about whether or not they want to do that.

The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in his contribution to this debate earlier talked about the previous administration of the QIDC, and I am sure the member for Kennedy will want to talk about that. But the member for Moreton and none of his colleagues want to talk in any balanced way about the state banks of South Australia or Victoria. They really want to avoid those issues. I can understand why they do not want to get into that area because the performance of those state owned banks ought to be—and will be for a very long time—a great embarrassment to the Labor Party because the losses in those states amounted to billions of dollars.

         Let us be quite clear that, when the QIDC was corporatised and went through that process, its debts were guaranteed and are guaranteed by the Queensland government. While it had limitations on its activities, those guarantees may not have been of great concern but, once it becomes a bank, they ought to be of concern and that ought to be a worry to all Queenslanders.

         Let us just get back to what the extent of this problem was. The State Bank of South Australia has so far cost the taxpayers of that state $3,200 million—over $3 billion lost by the State Bank of South Australia so far. The fiasco in Victoria in banking cost the taxpayers of Victoria $2,000 million, over $2 billion. Now we have the Goss government going down the same track of getting into the banking business.

         Make no mistake: the QIDC is operating in a high-risk area. It is essentially lending to industry. It is not engaged in lending for home loans, which of course is the safe end of the lending spectrum, by and large. And Queenslanders might not be aware that, by virtue of this authority, it is authorised to operate in the derivatives market. I do not want to overstate that because, frankly, I am relieved from discussions I have had with the Governor of the Reserve Bank and others involved in the derivatives area that there is no real cause for concern about our banks' activities in respect of derivatives, which are a genuine part of their operations.

        The fact is that this bank, QIDC, will be operating in a high-risk area, as were the State Bank of South Australia and the State Bank of Victoria. Honourable members should look at the losses they made. I am not casting aspersions on the board of the QIDC at all. It happens to be a very well balanced and qualified board, but the point we are making is that there has been some obfuscation by the Queensland Treasurer about whether it was a bank of not. It is a bank and it is operating as a bank. It is guaranteed by the Queensland government, and that ought to be up-front.

         Why has the Treasurer of Queensland not admitted that this is the case? At least what he is doing in Queensland would then be out in the open. If and when he does do that, Queenslanders should ask themselves: why does the Queensland government want to go down that track when everywhere else it has proved to be a disaster? In fact, people are heading back in the other direction. But the shingle is up. The QIDC is opening branch offices in southern states. In those states it is seeking retail funds. It is competing in the retail sector for funds.

         The Treasurer in Queensland is entitled to rely on the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. That is the peg upon which he hangs his hat in respect of this issue. That might be some comfort, but in the end that is not what this issue is about. There was unofficial supervision of the state banks of Victoria and South Australia, but that certainly did not save them. We know—it is on the public record—the Reserve Bank was well aware of the potential dangers faced by those institutions months in advance of those dangers becoming public. So prudential supervision is not in any sense a guarantee of performance.

         So far the Queensland government has had a very poor record for investment. I, frankly, do not trust it with a bank. As a Queenslander, I prefer the Queensland government—or any government when it comes down to it—not to be in the banking business. I certainly do not trust the Goss Labor government with a bank. The Goss Labor government invested $6 million in Compass Airlines. That was a brilliant investment! Most of us watching were quite aghast that a state government would want to get into that business at all, let alone so unadvisedly. It only had to look a little beyond its nose to realise what a high risk little venture that was. The government did its $6 million in a matter of hours. The money lasted hardly any time at all.

         It is quite clear from the statements of the Queensland Treasurer that the government is trying to make sure that the financial status and independence of the QIDC are protected and that it has very high prudential standards. That is why it is entering into this technical arrangement as far as the QIDC is concerned. It is quite clear that what it is requesting of the Commonwealth government is that the QIDC be defined as a bank under section 5 of the Banking Act. That section requires it to be a bank in only a technical sense. The QIDC is not going to be competing with the private sector.

In doing this, the Queensland government is prepared to refer certain powers to the Commonwealth government. In addition to what the Reserve Bank of Australia will do, the Queensland government has in place very effective supervisory arrangements.

         As my colleagues the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) have previously said, when the Goss government came to power in 1989 an independent report indicated that the QIDC's management had been very poor. There was political interference in commercial matters, cases of commercial conflict of interest with directors and staff, lack of board leadership, poor or no risk management systems in place, and instances of abuse of the schemes of assistance administered by the government schemes division of the QIDC. This effectively meant that the organisation of the QIDC was at very high risk of failure.

Its main purpose was to ensure that the taxpayers of Queensland received the full benefits while at the same time being exposed to minimum risk. What we have ensured not only in the Queensland parliament but also here as part of this bill is that those statutory arrangements are effective.

         As we have moved a number of the community service obligations out of the QIDC, we have a much more effective operation. However, that does not mean that we, with the QIDC, are moving away from supporting rural investment. If you look at the loan book of the QIDC, you see that as recently as 1992 rural sector loans made up 67 per cent of the total loan book. So the QIDC is still very heavily supporting rural and regional development. However, the reliance on a one-industry sector approach constitutes a major commercial risk. It has diminished over time. It has achieved a much more balanced portfolio. Currently, the rural sector represents about 50 per cent of the QIDC's loan book. That indicates a very proper management of development in Queensland.

         The one thing that is quite clear—I suspect we will not hear it from the member for Kennedy because I heard his contribution in a debate yesterday—is that, while beef and in particular coalmining are major industries for export not only for Queensland but for the country, the great challenge for Queensland is to diversify its industrial and manufacturing base and to bring on stream other competitive export enterprises. What we do know is that commodities are at the mercy of international trading cycles. It is very important to have an effective investment operation in Queensland to provide for that investment.

         I think the Queensland government has been very successful in the turnaround of the QIDC, giving it a much more effective financial position. That also means that it is part of the achievement of the Queensland government not only to become the only state that is net debt free but also by June 1996 to have expected net assets of $1.6 billion. We are not servicing debt in Queensland because of the prudent financial management of the Goss government, including the Treasurer, Mr de Lacy.

         Infrastructure spending has increased enormously under the Goss Labor government. For instance, I will mention the family services portfolio. In 1989-90 the budget for the Department of Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs was $159.57 million. Today, in the current budget, it is $500.9 million. So there has been an increase not only in family services but in police, education and hospitals. We had to turn around years and years of neglect.

At that opening the chairman stated that the loan book for the branch had gone past $100 million, which makes it one of the largest loan books of any branch of any financial institution in Queensland regional areas. There has been a necessity, both in Rockhampton and Emerald, to move to larger premises and put on more staff because of the development of business investment in those regions. This is also happening at the Mackay and Longreach branches.

         This bill is about finalising arrangements that have already been put in place by the state government, having learned from the mistakes made in other states about the support of various state banks. The kind of furphy the member for McPherson peddles is that state governments cannot be responsible in providing infrastructure investment. What is very clear from these arrangements is that the Reserve Bank will have very effective powers of supervision. The Queensland government itself has effective auditing requirements in place to make sure that not only will the QIDC work in the interests of investment in Queensland, but also taxpayers' money will be effectively looked after. In fact, it has already made a profit and will continue to make a profit and put money back into the Treasury for further infrastructure investment and for further services to the people of Queensland.

We have never had a minority government; we have had a majority of the vote in every election. The honourable member for Capricornia sits here as a member of a minority government. The Labor Party did not win a majority of the votes in the last election campaign. The honourable member should not come in here and talk about a gerrymander when the Labor Party is in that situation. She ought to check her facts before she starts shooting her mouth off.

With the collapse of two banks in Australia, we lost $6,100 million. Corruption is at the very heart of the debate we are talking about, and that is why I am canvassing these issues. If three ALP speakers are allowed to get up here and absolutely vilify the National Party in Queensland and I am not allowed to reply or even defend the performance of those people with respect to a state bank that was set up by the Queensland government, I put it to you, Deputy Speaker, that my chances of getting a fair go here are very small. But you are the referee, so I will listen to your ruling.

         I read the Polichronis report and analysed it in great detail. I found it absolutely staggering that the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the member for Leichhardt and the member for Capricornia stood in this place and said that the report referred to corruption. There was not a single reference in the Polichronis report to corruption, from the first page to the last page. The report was highly technical and demonstrated classical economic rationalism throughout.

         Clearly the three members who quoted extensively from the report had not read it. They had absolutely no idea what was in the Polichronis report. Polichronis recommended that QIDC stop being an agricultural bank or anything of that nature and become a purely commercial bank. The reason he recommended this is that he believed QIDC should offer purely commercial interest rates, not preferential interest rates. At that stage, all of QIDC's loans to the public were at two per cent less than those being offered by commercial banks in Queensland. He was reflecting the attitudes, philosophy and self-interest of the other banks in Queensland.

         Our policy was completely opposite to that. In fact, Bill Gunn, the Deputy Premier of Queensland, and I served on the committee of review, and we said, `In a commercial field, we can borrow the money at two per cent less than the banks; therefore, we can loan it out at two per cent less. We can choose our blue chip lendings.' Quite frankly, we thought that, if that was going to be to the detriment of the private banks, that was a criticism we would have to bear.

         This is the staggering part of the report. Interest rates were 20 per cent at that time. Polichronis advocated that we abolish all of the special loan funding arrangements via the QIDC special lending arrangements to people in trouble in small business or the farming sector. He said that that should be abolished and the interest rates should become 20 per cent. He got his way, even though it was over the broken backs of tens of thousands of Queensland small businessmen on the land and in the cities. That is what happened as a result of the Polichronis report.

         Previous speakers on our side pointed out the ALP's record in running state banks. The State Bank of Victoria fell over, with a loss of $3,000 million. The South Australian State Bank broke that record and fell over with a loss of $3,100 million. I would have thought it would be the last thing on the planet that an ALP government would want to become involved in. But that is what is happening here today. The Queensland government is going into the field of banking. If you looked at Rothwells as a state bank—if I could be facetious and say that Rothwells was a state bank—you would see that it fell over, with a loss of $1,000 million, as well.

         We come to whether these people are capable of running the financial administration of Queensland. Quite rightly,  the speakers from the government side said yesterday that the poverty report in Queensland was a 1990 report. It was a 1990 report. It would be very unfair to blame the present Queensland government for that 1990 report. So what did I do? I got the figures out and upgraded the report to find out whether or not the government in Queensland was culpable. I suspected that things were going all right in Queensland and the figures would not be as bad as the ones in the report.

         The first statistics that I chose, naturally, were the figures for average weekly earnings. I found out that Queensland has by far and away the lowest average weekly earnings in the entire nation. In Queensland average weekly earnings are $496 a week, whereas for our two neighbours, the Northern Territory and New South Wales, average weekly earnings are $593 a week—almost $100 more in the Northern Territory, and almost $70 a week more in New South Wales, with $567. The only other state that was low was South Australia, with $522, which is still miles ahead of Queensland on $496 average weekly earnings.

         The previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, said that we on this side of the House do not take into account  investment in people. That was the expression she used. It is very unfortunate that she used that expression because investment in people comes down to education, for example. In Queensland we have the lowest retention rate in Australia, with the exception of South Australia, for people between 15 and 24 years of age—which is the education age, if you like.

There has been a massive increase in spending on health. But what is happening on the ground? This is a staggering statistic. I had enormous difficulty believing it. The Queensland government has cut the number of beds at the Townsville General Hospital, which is the biggest hospital north of Brisbane, from 540 to 360. Of course, if you cut the number of beds, the queues extend right out into the street and people die because they simply cannot get attention fast enough.

We could lend the money out at two per cent less than the money coming in. We could choose the sorts of people we wanted to lend to, and obviously housing was a very attractive area to us. The profits we got from that area would have been repatriated to help small business, which is staggering under the load imposed by the federal government, which took interest rates up over 20 per cent for the first time in Australian history and which took bankruptcies from 4,000 a year to 17,000 a year. At that time we were desperately trying to help these people in small business, whether they were in a town or on a farm, and we thought we could do that by taking the profit from the $2,000 million and repatriating it into this other area.

         The bill itself is a simple one. In fact, it is just a few pages in length. The most significant part of the bill is the proposed amendment to section 5(1) of the Banking Act to include the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. That is the nub of the whole bill. What will this give the QIDC that it does not have now? If you look at the Reserve Bank and its supervisory powers—for a large part of the last 13 years the Treasury has been the responsibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as the Treasurer—you will see that the protection offered under the Banking Act is not as great as it seems.

It was formed out of the Rural Reconstruction Board, and it also took up the Agricultural Bank facilities. Let us not be embarrassed about what the Agricultural Bank and the QIDC were set up to do. They were set up so that higher risk loans could be made to the people on the land. Those loans were made for a purpose. They were made for the development of the farming and grazing sectors of Queensland. The farming and grazing sectors still help out to a large extent the balance of trade.

When people criticise the board they must remember that the initial chairman, Graham Tucker, was a very competent person. He never saw eye to eye all the time with the Premier of the day but he was able to bring a degree of integrity to that bank which I believe has survived to this day.

         This brings me to the point: what are the activities of the bank? I want to mention, in particular, its activities in connection with rural reconstruction. Rural reconstruction was the activity of the old Agricultural Bank right back in the early days. It is important to understand that the bank will continue to be the distributor of these funds. While I have a lot of respect for some people working within the rural reconstruction area and the rural adjustment area, I believe that the QIDC and the government of Queensland are profiting by the fact that this money is not getting out as readily as it should to those people in grave need. Part of my electorate is now going through the fifth year of drought. I can speak for a lot of the rest of Queensland that is not getting the funds required to help these rural people, experienced people on the land with a future in front of them.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One aspect of the reconstruction where there seems to be a deficiency—and I have heard this right throughout Queensland—is that the amount of funds to reconstruct farmers off the land and give them a place in a town or somewhere are only available if arrangements are made with the rural reconstruction area of the QIDC before the event of reconstructing that debt with the major lenders. This has not always been the case. We have seen many people thrown off their property because of the lack of security, because of the high interest rates, with nothing to go to. Any application after that date is not a viable turnout.

         I did mention that the incorporation in 1986 of the QIDC was a move designed to assist, in particular, those people in rural Queensland. Since that time it has picked up many other aspects of help to industry, as the title suggests. In that period it has had a chequered history. There have been loan write-offs. We have heard the member for Kennedy say that in the time of the National Party government the write-off was the lowest of any of the banks throughout Australia. Since that time it has had massive write-offs of debt, particularly on high risk ventures. I mention Compass Airlines. I believe it lost on that. I am not sure whether it is putting money into the Indy participation on the Gold Coast, but obviously that is money that has gone too.

         So there has not been that same history of accountability, in spite of what the Labor government says. Perhaps the supervision to be given by the Reserve Bank will assist in some way in ensuring that that risk factor is not as high as before. But I say again: don't count on it too much because many banks in Australia have failed even with that supervision.

        —I table ministerial arrangements and the standing of the second Keating ministry. It will show that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) has been elected by the parliamentary Labor Party as Deputy Prime Minister, which is a great honour for him. He was elected unanimously. As I said in my public remarks, the sense of warmth and seamless commitment to the work of the government in the very gracious resignation of Brian Howe and the election of Kim Beazley unanimously I thought spoke volumes for the unity and cohesion within the government. Given the very long history of the Minister for Finance in major portfolios and his very deep commitment to this chamber and its processes, he has also decided to stay on as Leader of the House. Now when he speaks in the House he will speak with the added authority of being the Deputy Prime Minister of this government.

I remind him that after eight accords Australia now has the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world—worse even than Mexico. Prime Minister, what explanation can you offer for the disastrous slump in foreign investment in Australia other than your failure to tackle the current account deficit problem? Does the fact that foreign investment in Australian equity has fallen from $5,000 million in the March quarter of 1994 to just $20 million in the corresponding quarter this year not confirm the OECD's serious concerns that continuing high current account deficits threaten to drive foreign investors out of Australia?

In doing so, he returns to the scene of the crime. He returns to the fact that, during his stewardship of economic policy in Australia, with double digit inflation he destroyed the propensity of Australians to save. Australians, bitten and burnt once, were not about to come back and lend their money to people at less than the inflation rate, as happened in the 1970s. There were negative rates of interest at some point in the 1970s with the rates of return being less than the inflation rate.

         Is it any wonder that we had a trend decline in private savings? After the former Labor government commissioned the Hancock committee to look at the introduction of a comprehensive superannuation scheme to approach the savings issue in a direct way, the member for Bennelong said—I quote from his press statement—`The government has decided not to introduce the scheme of national superannuation recommended by the majority of the committee.'

This Accord shows that the Accord process of managing an economy—that is, not putting all the burden onto fiscal or monetary policy but having a third instrument such as wages—is the way that the Australian economy can best be operated and run in the context of a set of cooperative agreements between the government, the work force and the trade union movement of this country.

         This is the model for running an OECD country with higher rates of growth than would normally be able to be obtained with low inflation and high productivity. We have developed skills changes in the labour market, coming under the accord, through productivity, award restructuring and the education and training system. We have come to the point where we can run a growth economy and can have a naturally contestable market producing volumes of productivity naturally from the system while holding the inflation rate down.

         If you look at the production of a sustainable rate of economic growth with low inflation you would find that the government has engaged three policy instruments in the last 12 months: adjustments to monetary policy late last year, which were relatively small; adjustments to fiscal policy through a strong change to the budget balance, but one that protects the social wage through outlays; and, there is a lot of weight on the third instrument, the accord and wages. By spreading the weight over the three instruments and not over two we did not have to pull the monetary lever hard with a massive increase in interest rates and we did not have to cut government spending to pieces. We have seen the economy come back to 3.7 per cent economic growth and we have seen inflation remain at low levels. This accord says that we will have low inflation and good growth for the coming four-year period. Could you imagine the coalition being able to produce a document like this providing low inflation for four years?

         —On inflation, on profits, on investment, on wages growth—on all of these things—Australia was in a vulnerable position by the early 1980s, so much so that the current account deficit was six per cent of GDP in 1980-81. Our debt had risen from about five or six per cent of GDP to 30 per cent in the three years after the government came to office; that is, the long-term rot had produced a change in just three years of 30 per cent.

         In the period the government then substantially stabilised the growth of that debt, so today it is about 36 per cent or 37 per cent of GDP, from memory. That is with the placing offshore of $86 billion of Australian assets. In the imputation of the question from the deputy leader, he failed to mention the fact that we have offshore now $86 billion in private Australian assets, against $7 billion of private Australian assets in 1983-84.

         So there is $80 billion of our national debt sitting out there, which has basically been accommodated by this shift in assets offshore by Australians. That is because we have made the judgment that it is better to be in these markets in western Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific than to have the choice of saying that we would basically not have these placements abroad but have a lower level of offshore Australian debt.

         Obviously, in Australia's best interests it is better to have these assets offshore, but they must be part of the equation. They are part of the equation with the foreign exchange markets. They know this. That is why when they see the sorts of figures that the deputy leader is referring to they immediately put the other side of the ledger into the account—that is, $135 billion of offshore assets and the $86 billion of offshore private assets, of equity placements offshore. That is why the markets have a much better understanding of the quality of change in economic policy and the balance between the onshore debt and the offshore debt.

         I am afraid the opposition is going to have to do much better. I repeat: the member for Bennelong will always return to the scene of the crime. He will always revisit his old work in the 1970s, or his lack of it, when the current account was at about six per cent of GDP in 1980-81 and former senator John Stone, as Secretary to the Treasury, said in that note to him in the last week of the 1983 election: `Treasurer Howard, this is the biggest fiscal deterioration since the Second World War.' And Treasurer Howard kept it quiet in the dying days of the 1983 election. He hid it—so-called transparency and honesty in economic policy making! A few of us around here have a good memory for J.W. Howard's tricks, or the absence of them.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, Accord Mark VIII has very significant and important implications for the government achieving its job target of five per cent unemployment or better by the year 2000. The government has been committed to the Working Nation initiatives, prior to this Accord, for achieving that target. It is interesting to observe that in Monday's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         Ross Gittins, having talked about the things that are important to get unemployment down and also paying due regard to the initiatives under Working Nation, said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So, if all these things come together . . . we may come a lot closer to 5 per cent unemployment in 2000 than many people dare to hope.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is a very important recognition by a significant economics writer that these are policies that are working. Today, Accord Mark VIII is another one of those significant things coming together. What Accord Mark VIII does is commit the parties, and the trade union movement in particular, to working with the government to achieve a minimum 600,000 new jobs over the life of the agreement. Another important dimension of the Accord is the way in which it describes the significance of achieving that five per cent target. It says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So important is the jobs target to the social and economic well-being of Australia, that the union movement agrees that wage claims will be assessed against satisfactory progress being made on the employment goal.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, not only is it an Accord that is important for jobs growth and the jobs target, but it is an Accord that is important to sensible wage outcomes and to low inflation. This is an Accord that, in terms of its 600,000 jobs, builds on the commitment in the previous accord—Accord Mark VII and its commitment to 500,000 jobs over three years. As has already been noted, we have achieved in excess of 600,000 jobs in two years.

         The Prime Minister has indicated that we will not hear much from the opposition about the Accord in relation to wages and jobs, but let us just recall what the former opposition spokesman on industrial relations, now the Leader of the Opposition, had to say when Accord Mark VII was handed down.

         —No, not rhetoric. This is from the statisticians' records: two million jobs and a 40 per cent increase in household disposable income since 1983. But the import of the question is about the wages of Australians. The Leader of the Opposition has opposed every wage increase since 1981, bar two—the last two safety nets of this government. In other words, he has supported $16 in 14 years. He so hates working Australians that he wants to rip away at their wages, tear away at their income; he opposed every wage increase through the period until we got to the safety net. The reason he is arguing that is not that he wants to give them a wage increase but that he wants to get away from his draconian policy or the cosmetics of it and say that, in a cosmetic way, he would support some kind of safety net.

He wants to turn Australians out of the wages system to a system where their meal allowances, overtime and penalty rates are no longer part of their wages. He wants to drive them back to award minimums and award minimums only. If workers move out of the wages system—and 1.6 million Australians change jobs—they lose all the award protections. He is going to gut the award system, and these people are going to come back into the system without protection and only under individual wage contracts.

         John Howard is out there to butcher working Australians on their wages, just as he has always done. He has been the complete tory on all this. He has opposed all the wage increases. He is basically about ripping the low paid down. As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, what an objective! Here is an economy with an enormous strength and wealth. This year we have had four per cent growth—four per cent of $500 billion—and $20,000 million of extra wealth, but John Howard will not see someone on a $20,000 wage get a decent adjustment or protection under the awards.

        The no disadvantage test will let people move out into the enterprise bargaining stream so that they are not disadvantaged. If they are disadvantaged, they get picked up under the safety net arrangements. Increases over the period will be $9 to $12 and, for those who are on award minimums, $11 to $14. What could be possibly wrong with it, other than an absolute cynical desire to rip away at the award protection and push wages down?

         Already under the framework established by the Industrial Relations Reform Act, we have seen some 60 per cent of all federal award workers covered by enterprise bargains—a figure more than double that achieved by any state system. At the same time we have achieved high economic growth; we have achieved record jobs growth; and we have done so at a time of industrial harmony, low inflation and wages moderation. It has been a fantastic outcome. Accord Mark VIII released today will maintain that. It will do so while delivering responsible safety net wage increases to the low paid and to all employees unable to secure enterprise agreements.

         For the benefit of the House, I will just outline the five or six key elements of that Accord announced today: firstly, a strong emphasis on workplace bargaining underpinned by a comprehensive award safety net—the sort of award safety net that you would rip away; secondly, safety net adjustments from $9 to $14 to protect those unable to benefit from bargaining, particularly the low paid; thirdly, the maintenance of an effective and comprehensive award safety net—the award safety net those opposite would destroy—but also making it more understandable, user-friendly and relevant to the needs of enterprises and individual workplaces; fourthly, support for phased-in employee contributions to superannuation to coincide with safety net wage increases supplemented by employer and government contributions; and, finally, assistance to families and the encouragement of work practices that better balance work and family responsibilities. These are the key elements of Accord Mark VIII.

They guarantee the continuity of the processes of decentralising our labour market, but they do so while maintaining all the vital protections required to give employees confidence as they move into the bargaining process. Together they deliver workplace change and productivity increases, but they ensure that employees get a fair share of the dividend. Whether it is through bargaining or through safety net adjustments, no-one under this system is left behind.

The coalition can guarantee only that workers will be worse off—because, as the Prime Minister said today, it stands for the abolition of the no-disadvantage test. That is one of the great fundamentals underpinning our whole system. It is a fundamental that you would remove. The very cornerstone of your policy is to remove the no-disadvantage test and to replace the award system with four miserly minimums: four weeks annual leave, two weeks non-cumulative sick leave, 12 months unpaid maternity leave and a minimum hourly wage—not even a minimum weekly wage. That is all we get from the opposition.

         Opposition members would have seen references I have made in the House about a number of the European countries and the fact that they have high wages growth but very lousy work force growth. In Australia, we have come up the middle. We have strong employment growth and a sensible basis for remuneration. But we do want to look after the less advantaged with a safety net. It is a safety net that the opposition is opposed to. It wants flexibility. But it does not want flexibility upwards; it wants flexibility downwards.

         I repeat the point: why anybody would want to hop into people on $20,000 a year and reduce their wages, or reduce the wages of people on average weekly earnings, those on $33,000 a year, is beyond me. I can see no economic point to it—not when the profit share in the economy now is so high. What are you arguing for—a higher level of profits to GDP? It knows no historic precedent. Why would you get it by tugging away at the people on the bottom? That is your vicious prejudicial position against working people. That has always been your vicious prejudicial position against working people. Even the people who run businesses do not have your position. It is just the snaky ideological position of your political party.

         —and `they, the government, ought to be announcing some severe corrective measures which they will take to fix things up', and `what is absolutely clear now is that the government has been running a fiscal policy which is too loose and the OECD has made that point'. The fact is that the OECD made no such point. What the OECD said in its half-yearly economic outlook was that the forecasts for Australia were very similar to those the government has. They were slightly different at the margin because it was talking about calendar years, not financial years.

         But with that minor difference they essentially endorsed our forecast. What they said was that we would have economic growth in 1995 of 3.8 per cent and in 1996 of 3.5 per cent—no sign of an economic apocalypse there. What needs to be clearly understood is that those rates are quite high by the standards of other countries. In 1995 that rate of 3.8 per cent is the fifth highest of all Western developed countries, that is, there are only four other countries with a higher rate of growth expected in 1995. For 1996 we are the fourth highest, that is, there are only three others with a higher rate of growth forecast. So, far from saying this country is facing an economic apocalypse, the forecast of the OECD is that this country is going to grow with the very top rates of growth in the OECD this year and next year.

         What about employment growth? The forecast by the OECD for this year, 1995, is 2.8 per cent employment growth and for 1996 2.6 per cent. Again, these are relatively very high rates of employment growth—the equal third highest rate of employment growth in the whole of the Western developed world in 1995 and in 1996 the third highest. No sign of economic apocalypse there. The OECD expects the continuance of very good outcomes with relatively high rates of economic and employment growth. What the deputy opposition leader said yesterday was based on the fact that we had a forecast for the current account deficit by the OECD in 1995 of six per cent. That reflects the six per cent figure that is in the budget for 1994-95. So there is nothing new in that figure; it is just endorsing the figure that we had in our budget. Like us, the OECD forecasts that that current account number is going to come down. They say that in 1996 it will be 5.3 per cent. They do not see it getting worse; they see it coming down with the breaking of the drought and reduced growth in imports.

         The government cannot be accused of being complacent about the current account. We have taken very substantial steps in this budget, as everyone in this House knows, to address the need to reduce the current account. We have done that by reducing the public sector dissaving through moving to budget surpluses and by the very important additional development built up under the Accord process, which we have talked about a lot today, to develop the new superannuation initiative, which will be an enormous boost to household and national savings in years to come.

         What is the opposition's position in respect of both of these major steps towards reducing the current account deficit? In relation to the budget opposition members are desperately trying to prevent the corrective measures that the government has announced and is trying to put in place being put through the parliament. They are opposing $1 1/2 billion worth of tax increases this year and $2.6 billion worth next year. So whilst we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition parading around saying that what this country needs is severe corrective measures he is doing his very best to stop the corrective measures in the budget from being put into place.

         It does not stop at taxation, either. The opposition is also opposing expenditure cuts. We have already seen the opposition in this budget debate oppose the cuts in child care which limit the number of non-work related hours of child care to 12. They are saying that they will not support that; they are voting against that. That saves $150 million over the four years of the forward estimates. They are against expenditure cuts as well as increased taxes. So we have the broad `Oh, yes. Let us have severe corrective measures. There is a terrible problem.' But when it comes to dealing with individual measures, which this government has responsibly put before this parliament, to reduce the pressure on interest rates and to reduce the current account deficit, they are opposing them one by one. That is incredible hypocrisy and shows how shallow this opposition is.

         The same goes for the superannuation initiatives. The opposition opposes them too. They are not in support of those initiatives to give a major boost to household and national savings.

         The fact is that this economy needs the budget measures to be passed. The forecasts that are made by the OECD are a follow-on from its spelling out in that document of the budget measures—that is, in the broad, the move to surplus. On the basis of that it says this country will grow by almost four per cent in 1995, will be at the top level of the OECD and will have similar results on employment with those measures.

Last November I advised the House that Telecom would be trialling a new service to make it easier for low income earners to get a telephone on at home. It is the government's view that, with telephone carriers investing billions of dollars in cable and with telephone companies investing large sums of money in improving the mobile telephone service around the country, we think the least they can do is also make it easier for the one million Australians who do not have a phone on at home by bringing in this service as soon as possible.

         Yesterday the chief executive of Telstra, Frank Blount, and I launched this new service, which is called InContact. It will allow households to receive calls and to ring the 000 emergency number. InContact will be provided with no rental, connection or service charges. However, where there is not an existing telephone line there will be a connection fee. But the good news is that, in the 20 of per cent of cases where Telecom estimates there will be a need for some cabling to be done, people will have that credited against the normal connection fee if customers subsequently upgrade to the standard telephone service.

         Mr Speaker, as you would know, this service has been trialled in Wollongong. The feedback suggests people who are looking for work find it easier because they can leave a contact number with prospective employers, and people believed they were safer and more secure knowing they could contact the emergency services number, especially those with young children and especially the elderly and retirees. Also, families and friends were more confident that they could ring to check people were safe, and children found it easier to ring their parents to let them know where they were or that they were safe.

         It is the view of the Liberal Party that it is a limited and short-term solution to let pensioners and isolated families be able to ring the 000 emergency services number. It is the view of the official Liberal Party spokesman that it is a limited and short-term solution to allow families and friends to be able to contact relatives at night; they would rather force them out of their homes to use the public telephone boxes. That being the official view, which was expressed by the Liberal Party spokesman on communications, I think we are entitled to know: is that also the view of the Leader of the Opposition? Does the Leader of the Opposition think that the InContact service is a limited and short-term solution? Do you agree with Senator Alston? There is no answer.

Does he think that the InContact service is a limited and short-term solution that should not be made available to the one million Australians out there who do not have a home telephone? I can certainly tell this House that all of the feedback from the people in Wollongong has been that they think it is a great service for them. In three states alone, Telecom has had more than 1,000 calls to the inquiry number from people saying that they are interested in this new service.

         The other comment Senator Alston made yesterday was that he believed this new service was creating a two-tier phone system and an information underclass, especially for rural and regional Australia. Those of us on this side of the House know that the quickest way to get a two-tier phone system and an information underclass, especially in rural and regional Australia, is to sell Telecom, which is what those opposite want to do.

         No doubt, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way and the new owners of Telecom included substantial shareholdings by foreign telephone companies, we would then be entitled to ask: how would the Leader of the Opposition guarantee that those foreign telephone companies would maintain the services in rural and regional Australia? How could the Leader of the Opposition assure the member for Parkes that the foreign telephone companies would not cut back the services in Broken Hill? How could he assure people that services would not be cut back in Mackay or in other National Party electorates? When you look at the opposition spokesman's briefing papers for the opposition shadow cabinet, you can see there are no policies.

         Austudy is a financial grant to help students from less well off families. It is income and assets tested. If a family operates a farm or a business in which the owner works for more than 17 1/2 hours a week—and we are not talking about Pitt Street farmers, obviously—Austudy grants a generous discount on the business or farm assets. For Austudy purposes, only 50 per cent of the net worth of the farm assets is counted. Net means the value after subtracting any debt owed on the assets. A family can have a business, such as a farm, under these rules valued at around $750,000 net—that is, three-quarters of a million dollars—and still get Austudy.

         According to the latest ABARE statistics, the average net equity which the owner holds in broadacre farms in Australia, given over to mixtures of livestock and crops, is $663,630. That is below the Austudy assets test threshold, even without deducting the value of the house and the surrounding land. For wheat and for other crop farms the ABARE figures show the average net value of about $790,000, which is about $40,000 over the assets limit. But, when you deduct the value of the house and curtilage, again it comes below the threshold. For sheep and beef farms pretty much the same applies. The average equity is $790,000.

         In other words, the average farming family is not disqualified under the Austudy assets test. Of the 208 farms valued by the Australian Valuation Office in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia for Austudy purposes in 1993-94, only 33 were over the limit in gross value. More than five farm families in six had no difficulty qualifying under the assets test. Apart from that, there is the drought assistance package which I mentioned which provides a safety net for those in special circumstances. The Australian Valuation Office will provide valuations where weather or market conditions have forced the value of a property down.

         I should point out that farming families can apply for Austudy at any time during the year if their assets fall below the threshold. I would ask all honourable members, particularly those members of the National Party, including the member for Maranoa, to disown the claims of the UGA. Telling farmers that they should not apply for assistance is quite wrong.

         —My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that earlier today Senator Evans told the Senate that he had written to French Prime Minister Juppe after the election of President Chirac indicating Australia's opposition to nuclear testing but that Senator Evans refused to table the letter? Is the Prime Minister aware that subsequently today Senator Evans has revealed that in his letter to Prime Minister Juppe he did not make any direct representation whatsoever concerning French nuclear testing but simply congratulated him on his appointment? Is it not now obvious that the government wanted to hide Senator Evans's letter to the French Prime Minister because that letter is proof that from the time of the election of President Chirac the government has taken a soft and weak stand on the issue of French nuclear testing?

This is somebody who a few years ago was saying that the nuclear-free zone treaty was basically an anti-French treaty and little else. He said that it would swamp ultimately the Western alliance in the Pacific. That was the sort of thing you were saying at the time of the last test.

         The moment the announcement was made by President Chirac on 14 June I immediately issued a statement deploring the decision. Defence activities were frozen until the cessation of French testing, visits by French military aircraft or vessels, except those relating to humanitarian or surveillance activities which benefit South Pacific countries, were denied and the transits which, in any way, supported the testing program were forbidden. I foreshadowed contact with Pacific leaders. On the same day, the acting foreign minister, Senator McMullan, called in the French ambassador and issued a formal protest. Our ambassador made similar protests in Paris.

         I think that on those issues the government's position has been a very strong one. Let me say this also the government of France: the decision taken by the government of France is no deterrent against the greatest nuclear threats now facing Europe and the world—that is, the emergence of new nuclear weapon states, the rotting carcasses of old Soviet reactors in eastern Europe, stockpiles of degrading nuclear weapons and weapons systems and contaminated nuclear sites.

When I saw Prime Minister Balladur in France over a year or so ago, he said to me that one of the great concerns facing his government and Europe is the state of the 21 Chernobyl type reactors that are sitting in Russia, Lithuania and the Ukraine.

         Let me make it very clear: as far as the government is concerned, we will keep focusing on the nuclear weapons proliferation issue. We will keep Australia's best endeavours going towards these things, such as chemical weapons and the comprehensive test ban treaty. We will be doing all in our power to basically stop the spread of these weapons to non-weapon states. We will try to stop the diversion of these materials and we will keep reminding the French, amongst others, of the imminent prospect of some catastrophic failure to their north in those programs which do genuinely put the French population at some severe risk—but, unfortunately, as well, not just the French population but the population of Western Europe.

        —Twice during question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) misrepresented my position in personal references to me. He claimed that, during the period of the Fraser government, Australia had the worst current account deficit in the OECD. That is completely wrong. The worst current account deficit recorded during that period was minus 4.8 per cent of GDP. During that year, five other nations in the OECD area recorded worse current account deficits. That was the first piece of deception on the part of the Prime Minister. The second was when he quoted from the doorstop I gave in Queensland last week regarding French nuclear tests. He omitted to inform the House that that doorstop was given before the pusillanimous response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans).

         When you think about it, the history of economic management in recent years for a lot of Australians has been no laughing matter. It was again a classic, I thought, that the two principal operators for the labour movement in this country—the Prime Minister of a Labor government and the head of the ACTU—should appear on television to announce the latest political deal that they have done. The perception they were creating was one of Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with the word in tablets of stone. Yet the reality is a very different one for many Australians.

         The truth is that the accord is not an instrument for constructive economic reform to provide benefits to the average working Australians, but a political deal to foster the political position of this government and to keep this government in office. It would be a good thing if an accord were directed to genuine economic reforms but, sadly, after 12 years of this government that has not been the case.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Let us look at the history of a few of the accords. The accord arose out of Bob Hawke's win back in 1983 when Labor came into office. That accord saw the government go on a spending spree, the like of which we had not seen since Whitlam. It led to massive demand pressures in the Australian economy and, as has happened on so many occasions in Australian economic history, it basically blew out the current account deficit and led to the current Prime Minister announcing that Australia was on the path to a banana republic and to the economic policy of the following few years.

         That is not the only example of the accord I would remind the House of. The 1989 accord was a classic in itself. The 1989 accord included some significant tax increases. That fed into demand. Again, as has so often happened, that led to a blow-out of the current account deficit. Whilst promising as the government went into the 1990 election that we were going to have a soft landing, the government so jacked up interest rates that it brought on the worst recession in this country's history since the Great Depression of the 1930s. So much for the accord.

         All through this period we have had promises of better economic management but in reality a different picture. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) said, as Australia attempts to go past a growth rate of about three per cent, we always, given the current structure of this economy, blow the current account deficit. In 1983, ours was the fifth worst in the OECD; in 1984, it was the fourth worst in the OECD; in 1985, it was the third worst in the OECD; by 1994, it was the worst in the OECD except for Mexico; and, in 1995, we finally get to the top of the tree—we are worse than all in the OECD, including Mexico.

         It is an interesting reflection to go back to one of the few times the Prime Minister has ever really told the Australian public the truth about the Australian economy. It was on 14 May 1986 that he said that we were heading towards a banana republic. If we are to give those many hundreds of thousands of Australians who today are unemployed the real chance of a job as we go through to the year 2000, we will have to do a hell of a lot better than three per cent.

         Only last year the Prime Minister said that if you could not do four per cent then you ought to get out of the business. When he is asked that question, he always fudges the answer. People say to him, `We are not at four per cent now. So are we not matching your own criteria for your continued stay as Prime Minister?' He says, `Oh, well, we are near four per cent: we are 3.25; we are 3.75.' The fact is that we are nowhere near four per cent. We are moving away from four per cent. The prospect is not of more jobs in the future but of fewer jobs, particularly of full-time jobs.

         If you look not only at the current account deficit situation, you see that the underlying nub of this debate is whether or not Australia can achieve the gains in efficiency in the way in which we run our economy so that the average Australian family can enjoy a higher standard of living. If you look at labour productivity in Australia—I do not have the figures for the last two or three years—the labour productivity figures have picked up during the recession, which is a cyclical effect. But, if you take the figures from 1985 to 1991, the latest OECD figures which are available—

         —I will come to that if you like, if time permits. Give me an extension of time, Minister, and I will give you a real burst and give you something to answer, instead of the usual rhetoric we have from you. Over that six-year period on only one occasion did Australia do better on labour productivity than our OECD trading partners. People should ask themselves: after 12 years of Labor, am I any better off? The answer is no. They are not better off because those opposite oppose the sorts of changes that would make our economy a far more efficient place and that would give people real prospects for increases in the future.

         People should ask themselves: why it is that we have a poor productivity result? They do not have to take the opposition's view on this; they can take the latest OECD economic survey on Australia. The language the OECD uses is sort of Byzantine, polite, indirect and very often constrained, but its message on the labour market is crystal clear. The OECD report says that the industrial relations system still remains very complex and highly prescriptive. It says that our industrial relations reforms generated considerable confusion about the role of the commission and unions, and that, as a result, the negotiation of enterprise agreements is time consuming and costly. The OECD report says that it was questionable `whether awards are best suited to perform a safety net function' and that the complexity of the safety net structure constrains `the capacity of the labour force to adjust to change'.

         It is the change we want, Minister. You stand here and say you are moving us in the direction of that change, but the OECD report—it is very informative; only a short read, but well worth reading—notes that the government's rhetoric on enterprise bargaining goes back to 1987 and that even the changes made in 1988-89 were cumbersome, too complex and unable to achieve the productivity benefits that we need. So you have been talking about these things for years and years, but the Australian people have suffered as a result of your failure to get the productivity gains.

         The impact of the accord process on individuals again is not a happy picture. Real average weekly earnings, for example, have fallen by 0.4 per cent. If you look at the nature of our society—whether it is a fairer and a better place—you will see that the distribution of income, even allowing for the social wage, has become less equal. Basically, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer under you.

         We have suffered the worst recession for 60 years. Our current account deficit, as I have mentioned, is now worse even than Mexico's and worse than those of the OECD. We have had record numbers of bankruptcies and small business failures. There are also the social implications, including the impact on Australian marriages and the impact on young people—the high suicide rates and the absolutely disgraceful high youth unemployment rate we have in this country. It is a disgrace, Minister. We have a society with all the riches and a good democracy, but 25 per cent of our young people cannot get a job. Why is that? It is because of the constraining, rigid, inflexible policy that you have.

After the last 12 or 13 years of Labor, are you and your family better off? It is not a politically generated question. I think most people would say they are not better off.

He is the one with 100,000 scalps on his belt from the 1980-81 gross campaign they waged, which cost a lot of people their jobs. George Campbell is the bloke who knocked off Bruce Childs to come in here and be the Prime Minister's lackey in the upper house.

When you look behind these operators, he is the man, far from supporting the average battler, who is actually raiding the battlers in his own organisation because he has a request out to his own organisers that they surrender their long service leave entitlements—a pool of funds of about $3 million—to the union to pay for the mismanagement of the AWU by Bill Ludwig and people.

And what a day to do it on. What a wonderful day to contrast our industrial relations policies with theirs—on the very day that Accord Mark VIII has been released.

         What is even stranger is that he has called it on on the very day we have released the details of Accord Mark VIII, the very day we indicated to the House that we have tied up this wonderful package—a fantastic package—of expanded enterprise bargaining, of safety net increases, of industrial protection, of commitments to low inflation and of commitments to employment growth. Yet the member for Flinders has walked into the House and said, `Oh, no, the Accord is not an instrument of constructive economic reform.' This is the Accord that gave us Medicare. This is the Accord that stabilised the economy. This is the Accord that repaired the social wage. This is the Accord that gave the Australian economy productivity, that gave us skill enhancement. This is the accord process that gave us worker superannuation. This is the last in the line of accords after the one that gave us the concept of the trade union movement committing itself to putting jobs first.

It is a rerun of the Victorian model that has led to the great exodus of workers from the Victorian IR system. More than half a million  workers have flooded into the Commonwealth system, the national system. That has left its architect, Phil Gude, a national IR joke. That is Jobsback.

         After allowing for the basic family payment, the home child-care allowance and deductions for superannuation, the family nets $1,146 per fortnight. If he had exactly the same family circumstances but was unemployed—and I am assuming $100 per week in casual employment—the family would earn $1,272  per fortnight. That is a difference of $126 per fortnight. Where is the equity? Where is the incentive for battling Australian families to get ahead?

         I will now deal with the issue of unemployment. Today's Accord claims to create 600,000 new jobs by the end of the decade. Yet unemployment remains a critical issue in regional Australia. I will take you on a trip up the Queensland coast. In my electorate of Hinkler in Central Queensland, one in every three teenagers looking for work cannot get a job. That situation extends from the Sunshine Coast to Ingham. In the Wide Bay-Burnett region, the southern part of my electorate, the figure is closer to 40 per cent.

         The general unemployment rate, according to the DEET small area labour statistics, is 9.9 per cent in Gladstone, 10.5 per cent in Rockhampton and 12.4 per cent in Bundaberg.

         The statistical decline in long-term unemployment since Working Nation is largely a government inspired mirage. It has more to do with the government redefining 70,000 long-term unemployed as short-term unemployed after putting them through a labour market program. In other words, if you keep them going through labour market programs, you can say that they are no longer long-term unemployed. What a hopeless fraud. Commencements in jobstart, the government's most successful labour market program—I do not knock it, but those opposite boom it up with rhetoric—in the first six months of Working Nation collapsed to 30,000 fewer than in the same period the previous year. Commencements in other programs have also fallen well behind.

The nursery, the Pennyroyal Herb Farm, is a marvellous tourist attraction and production nursery. It was a state finalist in the Queensland tourism awards and a finalist in the business executive of the year awards in Queensland.

         Quite simply, the trade union movement in Australia in 1995 has the sophistication, experience and good sense of national interest to know that there is no point pursuing aggressive money wage increases if that produces undesirable economic outcomes. The sophisticated model is to understand that a dollar in the hand from the social wage is worth just as much as a dollar in the hand from the money wage. The union movement can cooperate with the government to coordinate those two aspects of economic policy—wage claims and the social wage.

         Brian Howe's departure has opened the way for yet another state Labor MP to run up the white flag and lay down arms in the battle against Kennett. These are the same characters who run around the northern suburbs telling us how devastating life is becoming because of Kennett. All the while they deceive people about their own intentions and the complicity of the federal government in the privatisation, freeway-widening juggernaut that is consuming Victoria.

         The better cities program facilitated by Brian Howe goes some way to fostering a distinctive inner urban culture. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by contrast, is more interested in his grand vision for waterfront Sydney, the restoration of 18th century Paris and the redesign of Berlin—all of which show that he is a cultural aficionado but none of which will enhance the lives of the battlers, which both sides of the parliament claim to be so concerned about.

         In the northern suburbs of Melbourne, the future of the material resources of the locality is open to question. Sydney Road, the spine of the suburbs of Brunswick and Coburg, has in the past been a vital and lively urban environment. Along the street are a number of heritage listed buildings, including the Presbyterian church in Sydney Road, Coburg; St Ambrose church and school; Cumberland Arms Hotel; Duke of Edinburgh Hotel; and the Mechanics Institute—all, excluding the first mentioned, of Sydney Road, Brunswick.

         —In the adjournment debate this evening, honourable members may be surprised that I will speak not on Jeffrey Kennett but on a constituent of mine, Mr Maurice Brumer. Maurice is a qualified second generation optometrist who has had continuous sole practice in Frankston for over 25 years. He is actively campaigning on behalf of children who, through no fault of their own, are condemned to a life of reading difficulties and early departure from the education system.

         Maurice has been punished for raising concerns about current standards of optometrical practice and the need to better incorporate findings of research into current modes of practice. In a paper entitled `Optometry: light of a perverted science', he initiated a discussion on the issue of spectacles being a harmful drug when not prescribed properly. He canvassed a number of matters relating to prolonged and intensive near-seeing, which he believes is not good for our eyes and our health. He firmly stated that the public has a right to know how glasses may adversely affect good health. Maurice made the point that he did not think this would happen while the optometry profession put the public interest in second place to its own self-interests.

         For his efforts, Maurice Brumer was expelled from the Victorian division of the Australian Optometrical Association, a first in history. He dared challenge the cabal that rules optometry in Victoria when he spoke out at a 1992 annual meeting of the Victoria AOA and the national AOA.

         An extensive body of theoretical and clinical evidence already exists to show the harmful effects of current optometrical practices. The analogy could be made to tobacco companies, where no amount of research and evidence will convince them of the health related problems of smoking and to the scandal it would be if they could successfully suppress such evidence.

         In the belief that the burden of proof lies with the profession to show that its current standards of practices are in the best interests of its patients, Maurice presented a paper before 400 optometrists. The only response since was for the Australian Optometrical Association to make him the first member ever expelled from the association. The Australian Optometrical Association rigidly enforces the code that the first obligation of the optometrist is to his professional colleagues. Maurice insists it is to his patients.

         They all used to be Public Service bodies located in Canberra, and it is this Labor government that has moved these bodies and staff out of Canberra. If the government had had its way, it would have done more. It would have moved the Maritime Safety Authority to Newcastle, but it backed down under intense pressure. It was the federal Labor government that voted for the Australian National Training Authority to go to Brisbane rather than to the ACT. It was this government that suggested the transfer of the Australian Broadcasting Authority to Sydney.

The young people are trained to be stockmen and stockwomen at a station in the remote north of Grey. Petrol sniffing is a major concern in the community. It kills; it causes lifelong diseases; and, like most destructive addictions, it tears families apart and ruins young lives.

         DEET has supported this training and rehabilitation program for some time because of its success. Late last year, an officer of the Department of Human Services and Health met with the couple who run the program. The officer was impressed and suggested that, because the program dealt with petrol sniffers, perhaps funding applications should be directed to the Department of Human Services and Health; after all, petrol sniffing is a health issue and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had been telling all of us in this House that she wanted to include Aboriginal health in her portfolio.

The couple obtained letters of support from the South Australian minister and they also obtained a recommendation from the Catholic archbishop, but still no word from the minister.

The minister also admitted in February this year that `funds that we have applied in Aboriginal affairs have not had the desired effect that we would all wish'. She went on to say:

        Minister, I think it requires you answering your correspondence. As for bipartisan support, the minister has received a wealth of it.

         Mr Speaker, I wish to speak about something positive in my electorate. You will recall that I have stood up in this House on a number of occasions and given the House and the parliament progress in the building, timber and forestry industries in my area. It is a subject that many walk away from because they find the difficulties in the industry beyond their comprehension or because their ability to do something is limited.

         In my electorate, you will remember, I became involved virtually the week after I was elected because there was a resource called water being pushed out into the ocean in ocean outfalls. In fact, there was a rather outrageous proposal being put forward by the local council, the Shoalhaven City Council, to try to propagate ocean outfalls. After a long time, and after a number of public debates with the mayor and others, it was resolved that, with the help of DEET, we would go through and have a look at ways employment might be generated by the use of that water.

In fact, there have been people who have contacted the council and said, `If you drought-proof us, we will bring large amounts of money to your area and spend it.'

True, the corporate structure I had envisaged, of the council, the landowner and the timber industry components putting in an effluent management scheme which had a capital component built in behind it, may not eventuate in the near future. However, there is a team from the government working in my electorate, headed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), Senator Faulkner and Senator Cook. Because of that team effort I am in a position where I have agreement, in principle, from a number of business people in the timber industry to form a holding company, which will aim to bring together production from some 30,000 hectares of plantations over the next few years.

         —I wish to bring to the attention of the House a situation that I find quite extraordinary and a matter that must be addressed by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) as a matter of urgency. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has made a decision that pethidine for long-term use is no longer available under the national health scheme and, despite the matter being reviewed some two weeks ago, the decision has been confirmed. The PBAC has displayed what I would consider to be a mixture of gross ignorance and unsubstantiated assumption that cannot in any way be condoned by the Australian community or many of Australia's doctors.

         By way of background: this situation came to my attention via a local constituent and her doctor. If the opportunity presents itself I will read the letter from the doctor which clearly sets out the position and shows the advisory committee's total lack of compassion. It seems extraordinary to both me and my patient's treating doctor that he can prescribe morphine or methadone for long-term use and this apparently is condoned by the PBAC as acceptable, but not so for pethidine. There is absolutely no reason why pethidine should be treated any differently, and I find it absolutely galling that the committee can make a unilateral decision without having any awareness of the likely impact of that decision on the individual patient.

         What is equally galling is that the basis for the committee's decision is that it believes the use of pethidine long term is `inappropriate treatment'. As far as my constituent and her doctor are concerned, the treatment by way of long-term pethidine prescription is totally appropriate treatment and I fail to see how the committee can make such a widespread value judgment without in any way taking into account individual circumstances. The other galling aspect is that, relative to other drugs, pethidine is extremely cheap and, therefore, there can be no financial reason for the advisory committee's decision.

The very fact that we now have, within that same week, the opportunity in this chamber to consider some of the elements of that report in greater detail than would have been available to us in the main chamber attests, probably as well as anything, to the very effective way in which the Main Committee has operated since its introduction last year.

          The present report which the Procedure Committee has had tabled in the House of Representatives is the third report of the Procedure Committee to the 37th parliament. In view of the wide ranging nature of the proposals in the first report, the committee felt very strongly that, after a settling-in period, the new procedures should be reviewed to see how they were working and whether any modifications needed to be built into them, whether any of them should have in effect been withdrawn from operation, and whether they should have been supplemented in any way. In November last year, the Procedure Committee wrote to all members and to anyone who was involved in the

Their knowledge of some of the more technical intricacies of procedures was of great value to the committee in advising us, and their drafting skills were of exceptional importance and of very great value to the committee in being able to bring forward this report. So I proffer thanks to both Robyn and James for their assistance, cooperation and contribution.

          Unquestionably, the introduction of the Main Committee would have been the most important consideration in that initial report, and it has been outstandingly successful. Members have related to it very well, as it is a much more intimate chamber than the main chamber. There probably would have been value in having this place referred to not as the Main Committee but as the Second Chamber. It was an objective of the Procedure Committee to seek to establish an alternative debating forum which would have a status equal, as closely as possible, to that of the main chamber. It has been called the Main Committee, and that title is almost certain to persist, but we should, as often as we can, think in terms of its being a second chamber to the main chamber, with a status as close as possible to the status of the main chamber.

          I also want to emphasise that the report is truly a bipartisan effort as far as the committee is concerned. I particularly want to thank the deputy chair of the committee, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who will be participating in this debate. When we are dealing with procedures of the parliament, which are obviously of great importance to how governments and oppositions perform in the parliament and how their performance is perceived—not only within this institution but in that wider institution the national community—it is often very difficult to come to a common position on some of the issues. In fact, that was often the case in reviewing that report and the new procedures. But I say to members of the opposition, and to my own colleagues, that the goodwill which they brought to that process reflected very great credit on their commitment to this institution and the important role they saw it fulfilling. It really was a very great pleasure to be involved in that exercise.

          As the statistics in the report indicate, the Main Committee has made it possible for the House of Representatives to consider legislation, reports and issues of various kinds in much more detail, and with much more time,  so that members have had a significantly expanded opportunity to speak and to examine legislation and issues. The committee was also pleased with the level of support for the practice of referring bills to standing committees for inquiry and report. That process of having committees examine legislation and other important issues is one which has been very finely developed and very finely tuned as far as the Senate is concerned. But this has been the first occasion when a significant initiative of that kind has been undertaken in the House of Representatives. I believe it will develop and I think it should develop.

          We also gave consideration to the minister's second reading speech. One of the provisions of that earlier report was that instead of the second reading speech being made at the time the bill was introduced and the explanatory memorandum was tabled, it would be made immediately preceding the second reading debate. That had some values, but the disadvantages vastly outweighed them. It was done for the following reason. The explanatory memorandum is essentially a bureaucratic statement which summarises the legislation for members of parliament, who are not necessarily experts on the legal way in which legislation is often expressed. So the explanatory memorandum is essentially a product of the bureaucracy. The minister's second reading speech is a political product of the government and of the minister, and while ministers undoubtedly do depend upon their bureaucratic advisers to assist them in the construction of those second reading speeches, those speeches are theirs. They can introduce any sort of political comment that they want to—and they often do, and should be expected to. But then that speech is not there at the time the explanatory memorandum is tabled.

          —Yes, they do, of course—and not only the explanatory memorandum, but also the minister's second reading speech. The Acts Interpretation Act has made that perfectly clear, so the explanatory memorandum also fulfils that legal purpose as well. The minister's second reading speech, in expressing the government's purposes behind the legislation as well, is an important matter as far as the courts are concerned. But, as I emphasise, the minister's second reading speech is a political statement, so the opposition should have access to the text of the second reading speech in advance of its leading speaker being expected to respond to it.

          There could be new elements introduced which are not necessarily reflected in the text of the bill or in the explanatory memorandum to which the shadow minister or the person leading for the opposition would need to respond. And since they need to respond, under these current new arrangements, immediately following the minister's second reading speech, they are often placed at a disadvantage. I do not believe that should be allowed to persist and we have suggested that we revert to the previous arrangement.

          I understand that the origin of the old committee stage rested with the fact that the old House of Commons would traditionally refer legislation to expert groups which were not necessarily committees of the whole of the House of Commons and, in that context, the speaker of the House of Commons had a special responsibility to the Crown, not so much to the chamber.

          As the committee consideration stage of the House of Commons developed, the speaker would vacate the chair, the chairman would sit in the chairman's seat, the symbol of the speaker's authority—the mace—would be taken off the table, placed under the table, and a committee of the whole House of Commons would then consider the legislation. We do not do that. The fact that those traditions have persisted, I suppose, reflects well on the traditionalists but is probably under attack by the iconoclasts, of which I am one.

The interchange in that consideration in detail stage has been much more effective in scrutinising, in detail, elements of the legislation. Each member now has an unlimited number of five-minute grabs during that consideration in detail stage, and I am not aware of any occasion when that opportunity provided for members has been abused—that is, where they have taken advantage of successive five minutes to make a second speech.

I think generally that ministers have been very responsive to their responsibilities in connection with not only their portfolio responsibilities to the chamber but also their legislation, to members on both sides of the chamber and to this parliament as an institution. This was just a little, gentle and courteous reminder to ministers that they do have a responsibility to oversee their legislation and to ensure the passage of their legislation. They should be there to present the second reading speech; they should be there to hear as much of the debate as they can; and they should be there to respond at the end in order to give the appropriate courtesies to those members on both sides of the House who participate.

          Question time is, and will continue to be, a very difficult area. It is not a question time. It is a gladiatorial time, an adversarial time and a theatrical time, but it is not a question time in which members of the opposition seek information. When members of the opposition ask a question they do not want an answer; their purpose in asking the question is to put the government under pressure and then, frequently, when the answer is given, the members of the opposition quite understandably complain because they say that answer is not relevant. On most occasions the claim that the answer is not relevant is based on their perception that the answer is not the answer they wanted their question to elicit.

We have in the report some tables which show questions without notice to ministers, from 1992 to 1994. There is some consideration given to the fact that more junior ministers are being asked questions than previously. It might have been instructive if we had asked for one further table: a breakdown of the questions from government members to junior ministers, as opposed to questions from opposition members to junior ministers.

          The simple fact is that question time has, on occasions, been turned into a platform for ministerial statements, particularly by junior ministers. A breakdown of the questions asked of junior ministers would show that government members are far more likely to be asking the dorothy dixer of the junior minister. It is the junior minister who gets frustrated because he or she does not get the opportunity to speak very often. The junior minister gets up and gives a dorothy dix answer, which is really a ministerial statement.

The drop since 1983 has been very marked. A comparison of that figure with the increase in the length of time that individual answers have taken, together with the table showing the decline in the number of questions without notice, gives the story.

          Far be it from me to refer to the other chamber, but I have been removed from it for 10 1/2 years now, so I feel a little safer in referring to it these days than I did when I first transferred to the House of Representatives. The Senate has, over time, evolved a system of a better use of supplementary questions and also a system of taking note of answers.

          This latter system gives an opposition member—or a government member—the opportunity to make a comment on an answer to a question, but does not exclude the minister from making further comment himself or herself. I know that the House of Representatives never wants to look like it is taking any hints from the Senate, but the fact that that system has worked shows that the type of suggestion that the member for Charlton made might have some merit and might be quite workable.

          The other point I wanted to make in this context is that, whilst there is a stated desire by the government to involve ministers more in the chamber, when you look at their conduct when it comes to their bills, the direct opposite is happening. If ministers really wanted to be more involved in the chamber, they would involve themselves at the obvious stage—and that is the consideration of bills stage.

          The committee's report does address this subject. I refer members to page 4 and onwards and, in particular, to table 2 on page 11, which shows government bills introduced in 1994. It refers to participation of ministers and, in particular, to the second reading debate summing up. There are some ministers who give their own second reading speeches, who are there for at least some part of the debate and who reply to the debate. As a member, I appreciate that very much. However, those ministers—unfortunately—are very few in number.

          I have referred in the past to the fact that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is probably the worst example in this area that the parliament has. She comes into question time when she is on the roster and gives a long answer to a dorothy dixer—but gives very brief answers to opposition questions—and then she does not appear again all week. For her first few months here, she was only appearing to answer dorothy dixers. I think she thought it was actually bad luck if anybody else dared to ask her a question while she was there on the roster.

She is yet to participate in a debate on any child-care bills which are introduced in her name in the House. That is left to her parliamentary secretary. That is disgraceful. Ministers cannot say they want a roster so that they can get a guernsey in question time and then not attend for their bills—something which is just as important as answering questions.

This is because second reading speeches on government bills cannot be given any way other than by a minister or parliamentary secretary. However, out of the 192 bills, 32 have been read by a parliamentary secretary who is not even in that portfolio. I do not mean to put them down, but parliamentary secretaries are very junior people in the hierarchy in terms of answerability to the public or to the government or to the parliament.

          What is even worse is that the second reading debate is summed up on only 43 occasions out of 192 by a minister from the responsible portfolio. That does not mean the debate has been summed up by the minister responsible for that bill. It just means that it has been summed up by one of the ministers in that portfolio grouping. If one calculated the number of times the second reading speech was replied to by the minister who was actually responsible for that bill and its administration, the number would be found to be significantly lower than 43.

          The column which indicates that 24 second reading debates were summed up by a parliamentary secretary from another portfolio shows us that the person who answers a debate in summary has no status at all.

          One of the problems for procedure committees, particularly when the government has a majority in the House, as it is required to do to form a government, is that recommendations need to be made with a mind's eye actually intent on getting them through. Procedure committees do not serve parliamentarians, the people or the parliament as well as they might if their reports languish and gather dust. That has not happened. Although
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          I would like to talk about some of the changes in the review. I want to say that I have always been a keen advocate of the rostering of ministers. I know the opposition members, not necessarily members of the committee, make great capital of rostering because they say we have a part-time Prime Minister. My area of disappointment, I suppose, is that I always believe that rostering ministers would open up the ministerial ranks to some opposition fast bowling. Whilst the opposition actually got the scalp of the former honourable member for Canberra Ros Kelly, it has not subsequently demonstrated an understanding of tactics in question time to take advantage of it. I am not trying to score points. From my own perspective, I think the opposition has failed to realise the potential opportunities that I always believe rostering provided. As the honourable member for Charlton said, I think we should not shrink from the fact that question time is always going to be robust. It is going to be the gladiatorial contest.

          We also need to note some changes about question time. Before the prominence of TV, the press media, by and large, dictated the flavour of what occurred at question time. Radio sometimes broadcast it but to very limited audiences. TV now provides the 10-second or 60-second grab. That is used as much to its advantage by the opposition as it is by the government.

          The point I am trying to make is a fairly simple one. As a traditionalist, I like to think that we are essentially parliamentarians in this place, as I know the member for Charlton and others do. We have to make the parliament relevant and we have to keep it current. We should value our traditions and nurture them but make them relevant to the current age. And that is why it is impossible to suggest that we can turn back the clock as far as the impact of TV on question time is concerned, and I would not seek to do it.

          I know the member for Moncrieff made a point about the limitations of ministerial statements. Let me say that I, for one, would welcome far more ministerial statements by the government. I do not think any government should shrink from being in a position to put its point of view to the people and to the parliament. But, if there has been a diminution of ministerial statements, I have to say that these things are often being done now outside the parliament to gain maximum impact, to make sure as many as possible of our fellow Australians come to understand what the statement is all about. A good example of that, which we discussed in the committee, was the Justice Statement, something delivered in Queensland. I am sure that, if the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) had delivered that statement in the House, it would not have made the same impact, and I commend the committee for recommending that, although a statement may have been made outside the parliament, we should have an opportunity to discuss it and dissect it. That is one of the areas where I suggest we should be more relevant.

The Senate has introduced something that we all thought would be absolutely ludicrous and unworkable and would completely limit ministers, and that was time limits on the questions being asked and time limits on the answers. If Senate ministers were sent a questionnaire, I think they would say that the system is working pretty well and in fact it has probably sharpened up ministerial answers.

          The member for Moore (Mr Filing) had a particular interest in questions on notice and brought forward the suggestion of having a time limit on responses. The committee developed a method whereby members could rise in their places if questions had not been answered after 90 days and raise the matter with the Speaker and the Speaker would write to the relevant minister. I am very pleased to see that the committee has now recommended that that be brought back to 60 days. This is still a very generous period of time.

          —That is right. On the hours of sitting, I must say that I was very much an enthusiast for reducing the hours of sitting. As the chairman of the committee has accurately reported, we are leading much more sensible lives, finishing as we do at 8 o'clock instead of 11 o'clock or even much later, but I would like to make the observation that in the period of time that we are here we are much more frenetic about what we are doing. We seem to be going to more and more committee meetings at a greater pace, and perhaps missing some of them. I do not know about my colleagues, but I certainly confess that. So, if we are to take full advantage of these reduced sitting hours, it seems to me that we really need to look at our committee system.

          If there were one area that I would invite the Procedure Committee to look at, it would be the area of committees of the House. That is not because I think they are bad—I think we were behind the times in moving to a committee system and the committee system has accomplished a lot—but because I think that there are far too many committees. We run the risk of drowning or diminishing or executing our committees by overload. However, there are still areas where I would like to see the committee system taken to. For example, I still remain very much in favour of having joint House and Senate committees. Once again, I welcome the hours of sitting. Unfortunately, the Procedure Committee cannot deal with party committees, and there are obviously party committees that opposition members go to and government members go to. I make the plea that both are in need of reform and adjusting, in the way we have adjusted the hours of sitting.

          I also draw to the attention of the House, and particularly of my good friend the member for Charlton, the issue of legislation that goes into the House. Firstly, there is a lot of criticism. I know that the member for Moncrieff is saying, `Isn't it dreadful that ministers aren't in the chamber all the time, looking to their business.' It remains a fact that much more legislation goes through the House of Representatives because the Senate does not agree to delegated legislation to the same extent as, say, the English system does. In other words, what is legislation in Australia would often be delegated legislation in England. So we have a much higher bill load than anywhere else.

          I think the key issue here is whether, on the important bills rather than the omnibus bills, the House and the Senate are giving legislation adequate consideration. Again in terms of keeping relevant with the times, the introduction of this Main Committee chamber is a bit of parliamentary microeconomic reform. It means that we do not have to have extra members or extra anything but this second chamber allows more people to participate than would otherwise be the case and it allows more legislation to go through than would otherwise be the case.

          I have always thought that you cannot inculcate the urgency or necessity for ministers to steer through their own legislation, and it is not always possible. Whilst legislation is an important aspect of their work, as the honourable member for Charlton will tell us, there are many other competing aspects that can prevent ministers being there. However, I think there is an element of pride in a minister taking an important bill through the House and I would be disappointed if that tradition was ever lost.

          It is also important to address the role of parliamentary secretaries. When they were first appointed under this government, similar to the earlier Fraser appointments, they were more like secretaries—answering bag loads of correspondence and attending functions—but I am pleased to say that their role has now evolved to much more than that. Parliamentary secretaries still deal with a lot of the administrative matters but, by and large, most of them have a discrete portfolio area. Whilst that may be minor in the mainstream of the portfolio, it is still a portfolio area. In that regard, it is very hard to detect the difference between junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries other than that the parliamentary secretary must report to the cabinet minister, whereas junior ministers often do not have that same diligent requirement.

          Honourable members may be aware that in the original report, which was tabled back in February 1994, the primary criticism made by a number of us was in relation to the Main Committee. We were concerned that the Main Committee would somehow be seen as causing a decline in respect for some of the debates. We had a feeling that we ought to have taken care in dealing with or bringing in a new committee that was going to be dealing with second reading debates on legislation, that this may cause those debates to be seen as second class because they were away from the main chamber.

There would be a number of us who feel that it has enhanced the workings of the House of Representatives, in particular, by allowing members, including independent members—as members would know, I am now an independent member—the opportunity to have a more detailed say and to more frequently voice their views.

          There are a few observations I would like to make in relation to the workings of the House. The first is in relation to the explanatory memorandum, which was the subject of the recommendation that departments should take steps to improve the usefulness of explanatory memoranda to members and others seeking clarification on the nature, purpose and effect of legislation. We also recommended that, whenever possible, in the case of government bills, ministers should make an explanation to the House of any amendments or requests for amendments made by the Senate on which the Senate is seeking agreement of the House.

          In our deliberations I cited the case of the Training Guarantee Levy Bill where there was a conflict between the explanatory memorandum and the actual bill. That was very confusing for those people who are responsible in their own businesses or elsewhere for the administration of—or response to—the legislation. In this particular case, there was a difference in the way in which one calculated the training guarantee liability on the part of a business. In fact, the explanatory memorandum allowed for the inclusion of sick leave and long service leave whereas the actual bill excluded it.

          When the people at the particular business that contacted me about the matter made inquiries of the Taxation Office, which had the responsibility for administering the act, they were informed that the bill was right and the explanatory memorandum was wrong. Clearly, people relying on the explanatory memorandum for guidance as to how the act was supposed to work would have been thoroughly confused about the difference in the amounts applicable to employing more people. In this particular case, they told me that in their business they could have employed an extra person on the difference between the two interpretations of the explanatory memorandum and the bill itself. That is a very important point.

          The second important matter was raised by the member for Moncrieff. I commend her for her contribution as deputy chair. She has always taken a strong interest in the workings of parliament in the Senate and continues that role in the House of Representatives. She has been instrumental in making the recommendation that the standing orders be amended to enable a minister to move the second reading of a government bill immediately following the first reading and for debate then to be adjourned to a future day. The recommendation also seeks  to make the second reading speech available for members so that they can not only interpret the legislation but also make their own contributions to the debate. It is thoroughly confusing if the second reading speech is not available, particularly if interpretations of legislation have already been made by the minister or if there is a policy, for example, on the interpretation of legislation which would cause debate or questions that would need to be clarified as to exactly how legislation would work.

          The member who spoke previously mentioned my own particular interest in questions on notice. As I am now an independent member I am more conscious of the fact that there are limited opportunities for ministers to be questioned by members of the House.

           Notice Paper

          I think that we on the committee unanimously felt that it was absurd that often, in the case of questions on notice, not only were ministers not responding to them for up to years in the sitting of a particular parliament but, in some instances, never answered the questions before the parliament concluded. Therefore those questions fell over the end of the cliff.

           About time
          </emphasis>
          , we have seen a process whereby at the conclusion, where 90 days has passed and the question has not been responded to by a minister, members can stand up and ask the Speaker to write to the minister concerned requesting that an answer be given. I think that is a perfectly reasonable process. The difficulty is, of course, that 90 days is a long time and I am very pleased that the committee has decided to change that to 60 days. That will put additional pressure on to ministers to gee up their process of answering questions. As we all know, sometimes questions have an immediate effect or immediate importance and, after 90 days, they disappear into what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) often calls `the ether'.

          That is a part of the process that individual members want to see reinforced and buttressed. Therefore, our recommendation that the 90 days be reduced to 60 days is a thoroughly useful one. In fact, at the conclusion of the question period on each sitting Thursday, it is recommended that the Speaker should make a report to the House listing those ministers to whom he or she has written pursuant to the standing order, any responses received, and those ministers who were reported in a previous report as having been written to and who have not responded, giving the date of the original letter. That report would be recorded in

          That is a very important part of our processes. After all, in the final analysis, the only opportunity for members really to question the workings of government in a direct way is in the question time period. I know that there is a recommendation there to bring question time to 2.30—another important move. I was a critic of the move to 3 o'clock in the first instance, because I believed that it would make it extraordinarily difficult for the media, particularly the electronic media on which the public relies so heavily for information, to actually report in a proper way, in a fair way, the question time period. Of course, because of the concertina effect between 3 o'clock and the ending of question time at half past four, the electronic media in particular often found it extraordinarily difficult to be able to deal with the tape and all the other video arrangements so that the public could be properly informed of what had gone on that day in question time.

          We obviously are concerned about the rostering system because the rostering system has led to instances where ministers are not present on particular days and a line of questioning has not been able to be followed by the opposition. If one were to see the parliamentary process as an adversarial one, then the question time period is the grinding edge of our democratic system. Clearly, if the members of the public are to retain any vestiges of confidence in their political system, then they need to know that that particular process works. I know that many probably view it with some jaundice in that they see on television the noise, the commotion and the dynamics of it, but nonetheless that is the grinding edge of our political democratic system. As a consequence, it is important that it works properly.

          In the final analysis, it is important that the public see it working properly. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that the starting time of question time be moved to 2.30. If that is not the case, then we are going to see the continuation of the problem that question time will not be properly reported to the public because, as I said, it is so close to the deadlines for the electronic media on which most people rely for their daily information.

          Let me make a point about the difficulties which the chairman has in respect of sitting hours. The chairman sits on a massively malapportioned committee. This is a committee which is massively malapportioned in terms of New South Wales, length of service of members and safety of seats. In other words, the views and the deliberations of this committee do not reflect those people throughout the parliament who live in outlying states, who occupy marginal seats and who are the newer or younger members of this parliament who are more likely to have families with young children.

          Let me look at the massively malapportioned committee in terms of safety of seats. I will not go through all the individual seat holders. The chairman, of course, has a margin of 17.2 per cent. I will not get down to the fine analysis as to how much of that is his personal vote and standing, but the average safety of the seats of the members is over 12 per cent. In terms of the membership of the committee, five members come from New South Wales, two from Queensland and one from Western Australia.

          I note the comments of the independent member for Moore (Mr Filing)—the very fine independent member for Moore—that he has been obliged to retire from the committee to be replaced by another safe seat New South Wales member. I can understand the chairman's difficulties here. The massive malapportionment of seniority, safe seats and New South Wales is only going to be enhanced, although the member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) will, of course, bring some youthful aspirations and vigour to the deliberations of this committee.

          When one looks at length of service, the average tenure of committee members is over 10 years. This does not include the service which the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) had previously in the Senate. So this is a committee which does not have as part of its full focus a view for the difficulties caused to outlying state members, to marginal seat holders or to those members likely to have young families.

          What is the starting point? It is prospective changes to sitting hours. As I have said, these are in section 9.2 of the committee's report. What brought about the current system? It was brought about by a view that the parliament was sitting too late into the night. When I first arrived in this place in May 1993, the schedule of sitting patterns and hours for the House was that we sat Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Invariably, we sat until 11.30 at night and, from memory, on Wednesday we got up at 8 o'clock.

          That was changed—I think sensibly—to the 8 o'clock close from Monday through to Wednesday, and a 6 o'clock close on Thursday. The rationale for that was that it was not sensible to sit those late hours. That was right. The price that was paid for that was that we sat Monday to Thursday, Monday to Thursday, on a fortnightly cycle. In other words, we sat an additional Monday throughout our entire sitting pattern.

          What effect did that have on Western Australian members? The effect was that they lost 10 Sundays per year in their electorate or with their families. Why is that the case? If members are required to arrive at the parliament on Monday, then they must leave Perth on a Sunday. The latest that members can leave Perth on a Sunday is effectively 5 o'clock, on a flight to Melbourne. That flight arrives in Melbourne at about 11 o'clock and then, courtesy of ministerial arrangements, the members catch a RAAF VIP flight to Canberra. They arrive in Canberra in theory at 12.30. Life being what it is, that is usually any time between 12.30 and 1.30 a.m. The consequence for the electorate and the families of those members from Western Australia is that they effectively lose 10 Sunday afternoons per year.

          The original recommendation which saw those changes had the close of sitting at 8 o'clock on a Thursday. I made Neal Blewett's life such a misery that in the end the committee recommended that the parliament close at 6 o'clock on Thursday to at least give members from outlying states the chance to get home on a Thursday night. In that respect, I was grateful for the strong support I received from the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Banks (Mr Melham).

          Let us look at how that change has worked in practice. It has been the case—but more often not—that the 6 o'clock close enables members from Western Australia to get on a 6.30 plane to arrive in Western Australia at 11.30. From time to time, the 6 o'clock close on Thursday becomes an 8 o'clock close. In the course of recent months, that has occurred more often than not, either for the budget reply of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), or for his reply on the republican issue. So that opportunity is sometimes lost. If the parliament does not get up until 8 o'clock on a Thursday night, members from Western Australia cannot get home on Thursday night, and so they lose that opportunity.

          In the course of my suggestions to the committee at our informal session, I elaborated on my formal written submission which suggested that the parliament should close earlier on the Thursday evening. My basic submission was that modest adjustments to our closing time on Thursday, coupled with modest adjustments to airline schedules, would guarantee that members from Western Australia, if they so desired—which I invariably do, and the member for Forrest shares my passionate obsession—would have the opportunity to return home on a Thursday night.

          That suggestion was not taken up by the committee. The most weighty point that was made in response to my suggestion was that, with parliament question time starting at 3 o'clock, and with the MPI on a Thursday, to close the House at 5.00 or 5.30 would leave no time for other matters and would not take into account things that might develop out of question time, such as censures and the like. I think that is a sensible point.

          My fallback position was: `Why don't we suggest some modest changes to the airline arrangement?' So I took the opportunity of getting hold of the submissions by Qantas and Ansett. I will read them into the record because they make patently clear that neither of the airlines has any understanding of what we do. That reflects as badly on us as it does on them, because it makes crystal clear the point that we have not bothered to take up the changes in our sitting patterns with the airlines in any forceful, constructive or detailed way. The Qantas submission says:

          I think that is right, and that is reflected by a notice from Qantas that I tabled at my informal session with the committee. It is headed `Qantas, the Australian airline, budget week special' and then tells us what a fantastic deal we get: we can depart Canberra and arrive in Perth on a new configurated jet on Thursday night, leaving at 7.40. The only problem is that no-one bothered to tell the people from Qantas, and they never bothered to check, that 7.40 happened to be 10 minutes into the reply by Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). That is not a plane that any person who has any respect for the courtesies of this parliament could catch. I happen to believe it is important to listen to the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply, whatever side of the House you are on.

          Here are the Thursday flight options which applied on the night of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply and which apply tonight. There are five departures from Ansett between 4.30 and 7.40 p.m. and three departures from Qantas between 6.45 and 9.40 p.m. Five leave just before anyone would have the chance of even sneaking out the door once the adjournment started. Modest changes to the airlines' timetable and modest changes to our timetable would have the effect of ensuring that some people, if they wanted to—and this is entirely a matter of choice—would get home on Thursday night. Others might prefer to spend the entire week here. This was a point made to me by the member for Moncrieff in the course of the informal discussions. Other people would prefer to spend the four days here and then get back to home, family, electorate and constituents as quickly as humanly possible. That is my preference and I would like to try to guarantee that.

         The only additional comment I would make in relation to sitting hours is that there is very little effective government business time available on Thursday afternoons after 3.00 pm. There is frequently great pressure on available time before 5.30 pm once question time begins if any complication occurs (keeping in mind that there is usually a matter of public importance proposed for discussion as well.)
        </para>
        <para>
         On a Thursday afternoon, once question time begins, you are never going to have any effective chance for government business. Why? Because Thursday afternoon is precisely the time that any opposition—worth its salt or not worth its salt—will raise censures, will cause disruption, for maximum political effect. The members opposite would do it, and we would do it if the roles were, however so disastrously or inelegantly, reversed. So any sensible management of government business requires that whatever business has to get done is done before question time on Thursday. After that, you are at the mercy of the political motivations of the opposition—which I respect and acknowledge.

          Finally, the committee did not take up my suggestion that we close the parliament half an hour or an hour earlier on a Thursday. Its formal recommendation 9.3.6 recommended that question time should commence at 2.30 p.m. each sitting day. Game, set and match: 6-4, 6-4, 5-3; new balls; the member for Perth is serving. If question time is at 2.30 p.m., not one moment is lost by starting the House on Thursday morning at 9.00 and starting the adjournment at 5 o'clock rather than at 5.30. It is a modest half-hour adjustment and, with a bit of detailed vigorous application to the airlines, we might actually achieve some sensible configurations which would make life better for those honourable members from Western Australia and other outlying states who happen to have marginal seats and young families.

I would take up, however, the honourable member for Perth's rightful indignation at what he saw as a malapportionment of the committee. There was a heavy representation from the eastern states and a lack of representation from the western states. Therefore, as a South Australian, I have even more reason to be indignant, given that there are no South Australian representatives on the committee at all. I point out to the honourable member for Perth that, in the case of the opposition, appointment to the committee is largely by nomination through the whip's office. I am not sure what arrangements the government has for representation on the committee.

I share with both the chair and the deputy chair the reality of having worked in this Parliament House and in the former Parliament House building. I am one of those people who thought that the former Parliament House ought to have been remodelled and ought to have remained the home of the federal parliament. It is not a view that I would still maintain because I think this is a building in which it is a great privilege to work and the architecture and facility of the building is something of which we all should be proud. I do recognise that the building has inevitably two problems, and those of us who have worked in both buildings are more conscious of these problems than are those who have worked only in this building.

The Prime Minister's style is to polarise the parliament. I respect his capacity to do this, but his style is to treat the opposition as if it were some lesser form of life.

          That is something about which I am quite indignant. We need constantly to remind ourselves, as parliamentarians, that everyone in the parliament not only has a right to be there, by dint of having been elected, but also has a right to an opinion, whether in government or in opposition. The opposition, regardless of which party is in opposition, has an obligation to speak for all of those people who did not vote for the government. I am charitable enough to recognise that even the Prime Minister may be prepared to concede that in a private moment, but certainly none of his mannerisms in the House would attest to that approach. So I find existence in this house much more polarised than it was in the other house, with the same party in power but with a different person as the Prime Minister.

This parliament building, by very reason of its extent, is a place in which people easily become isolated. As I look at the way in which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure addresses the whole question of the structure and sitting times of the House, I think we have an obligation to ensure that we do all we can to break down any sense of individual isolation. Part of the isolation is inevitable because of the architecture of the building. Part of it is inevitable because of the extensive facilities that we all have in our own offices, which allow us to be individuals and, if we choose, not to mix extensively with our colleagues. But part of it is broken down, I think, by a structuring of the sitting hours to ensure that people have maximum contact with each other if they choose so to do.

          One of the things that the Standing Committee on Procedure, when contemplating sitting hours, might care to take up is a proposal that we sit once again on Monday and Tuesday evenings; that there be a scheduled dining room time, as there once used to be, from 6.30 to eight; and that the parliament then sit from eight until 9.30, with a 9.30 adjournment. This would still allow the parliament to rise at a very respectable hour and it would still leave Wednesday evenings free for the sort of interaction that has become characteristic of Wednesday evenings, but it would mean that the total sitting time was extended and that the dining room became once again the focus for most honourable members who were in the parliament on a Monday and Tuesday evening.

I suspect that the caterers have no idea from one evening to another how many honourable members are likely to be dining in or dining out. It has also broken down the dining room fraternity that was built up, that was particularly significant in the old Parliament House and to a lesser degree extended into this Parliament House, but that now scarcely exists because at 8 p.m. people make a decision either to dine in or to dine out. I respect their right to do that, but the opportunity for some sort of parliamentary fraternity, by reason of the fact that we are all going to the dining room between 6.30 and eight, has been broken down.

That is perfectly true. But, constituents being what they are, and the image of parliamentarians being what it is, my constituent instantly translated that to mean that every lunchtime was extended from 12.30 until 3.00, that every lunchtime involved visiting delegations and that this was an indication of just how cavalier we, as a parliament, happen to be in the way in which we deal with the affairs of the state.

I say to the member for Charlton that he may well recall—though it is now longer ago than I would care to admit—the frustration of being an opposition backbencher in question time, and the difficulty of getting opposition backbench questions up. That is frustrating enough, without having it complicated and compounded by the absence of ministers whom the opposition particularly wishes to question.

I would however ask the committee at some future date to consider the wisdom of extending Monday and Tuesday evening sittings, not only to extend the business of the House, but to in some small way break down the isolation which is an unintended consequence of working in this building. This is largely in the hands of us as individuals, but it would be facilitated if we were to spend more time in dining in the same place at the same time. That was certainly our experience in the old house—and such a change would be a relief to the caterers, who must find the present provisions quite unpredictable.

          Procedure Committee meetings are very interesting, and I think the committee has, over the period since its inception, done a lot to change the way in which the culture of this place works. Those members who have been here for a while might remember that, prior to the Procedure Committee, we used to have a standing orders committee, which used meet on a very irregular basis. In the main, the government would say no to anything the opposition said, and the opposition would come away unhappy. Now we have the Procedure Committee being very generous, and the government being exceptionally generous in accepting recommendations, and the opposition members still are not happy, but they have probably now got more reason to be less unhappy than we were when the standing orders committee was in operation.

The member for Wakefield wants to dine and the member for Perth wants to go home. The committee looked long and hard at the propositions put forward by people about these sorts of arrangements. When we looked at the cut-off time for debate—6 o'clock on Thursdays—we also consulted the airline timetables.

          We were very careful in our original report to put forward proposals for the sitting patterns of the House that would allow members from every capital city except Hobart to return home on Thursday night. Most country people can return home on Thursday night. There are a few people who come from the very outlying states, and from the very outlying parts of those states, and they would have difficulty getting home on a Thursday night. If we brought the time forward, most of those people might get home just a little earlier, but it would not accommodate people who are from places with more difficult transport connections. While there might be some symmetry in the mind of the member for Perth about the committee asking for question time to be brought forward to 2.30 p.m.—in that that might allow us to finish at 5.30 p.m.—I do not think that that symmetry was intended, and I doubt whether there would be a change in the time that the government would propose as the start of question time.

It is not for that purpose. The sitting at 3 o'clock is to accommodate frontbenchers—ministers from the government side, and opposition frontbenchers—so that they are able to do things in other parts of this city and on the eastern seaboard during the morning and still get back to participate in question time, which is one of the most important parts—if not the most important part—of the parliamentary day. Under the old arrangements of 2 o'clock, that blocked out the day, but 3 o'clock allows people both to do their duty at question time and to be able, often, to see to some political activity in, say, Melbourne, Sydney or the city of Canberra itself. That sort of activity is a far better arrangement for constituents than our being able to finish at 5.30 p.m. on Thursdays.

          —The question whether we should sit late at night is one that a lot of members would not be happy with. What we have in the current sitting pattern is some consistency where people can plan either to dine later at 8.00 p.m. or to go out of the building. It gives people that flexibility, which is what people always demanded. One of the worst aspects of this building in the past was that we were all cooped up in here until 11.00 p.m. each night. We would arrive at 8.30 a.m. and get out at 11.00 p.m., we would go home, go to sleep and come back here at 8.30 the next morning. We never had any contact with the real world. These changes were made to encourage members not just to associate with their colleagues, but also to have the capacity to socialise on a wider sphere in Canberra and to do more human things than to sit around and plot and plan like the old sitting pattern used to encourage people to do. The executives on both sides encouraged this because they do not like backbenchers sitting around plotting and planning.

          The committee has made a suggestion concerning policy statements made by ministers outside the House, and I hope that the government will take up the committee's suggestion. With the way government works and with concerns about timeliness, et cetera, ministers often make important statements outside the house on matters about which members of parliament are very interested. The most significant statement in this regard is the Justice Statement which was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) recently. If these sorts of statements are not made in the House, they are, in a sense, matters unknown to the parliament.

          The honourable member said also that any opposition worth its salt would be moving censures, suspensions of standing orders and so on, and no government business would be done on the Thursday afternoon after question time. The reality is that in the last 18 months, since these new sessional orders came in and we started rising at 6 o'clock, there have been six censure motions. That does not apply to every week. There have also been 16 suspensions of standing orders—surprisingly, or perhaps not surprisingly when one thinks about it, 10 of those from the government. I imagine the six suspensions of standing orders were the same as for the six censures from the opposition, but the government has had need to suspend standing orders on 10 occasions since the new sessional orders came in. Obviously, it wanted to introduce something or change the order of business. The assertion by the honourable member for Perth that government business on every Thursday is disrupted by the opposition is not an absolutely correct assertion.

The honourable member for Watson has reminded us all of the fact, which I understood already, that the executive—he mentioned shadow ministers as well but basically it is the ministers—needs to be able to undertake activities in this city and on the eastern seaboard.

          I think the downside of that is that, by having question time at 3 o'clock, it is never televised live. It is televised at half past 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning. Of course, when the ABC replays it at that time, the audience is fairly limited. It is important that the people of Australia have the opportunity of seeing what is happening in question time. After all, question time is the focus of the parliamentary day. It is the only time that we have the Prime Minister there twice a week. Under the old system, we used to have all ministers present at question time—the entire shadow ministry still attends—but there is now a roster for ministers.

          Question time is the only time, when it is being televised, when the press gallery is in the chamber. The press gallery is half empty on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The press gallery is full on Monday and Thursdays, when the Prime Minister is there and we can expect a bit of fireworks. The public galleries generally tend to be full on the Mondays and Thursdays but are half empty on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. This indicates that the people of Australia believe that the parliamentary focus of the day is question time and that the greatest interest is there when the Prime Minister is present. It is absolutely essential that the Prime Minister is present. The Prime Minister is the leader of this country, no matter what party the Prime Minister leads, and we require that he be there and be available to be asked questions and to, hopefully, answer them.

          People do not really understand what goes on in question time. Schools come here to go to question time. It used to be very hard to get in but it is much easier these days. Constituents, and particularly children, constantly say, after they have been to question time, `We would not be allowed to act like that at school.' And, of course, they are quite right. However, I tell them that they have to realise that question time is structured in a certain way so as to be very dramatic and very theatrical. It is the focus of the day and oppositions, in the past and in the future, whether us or the present government, have only 30 or 40 seconds in which to ask a question. The government ministers can take five, 10, 15, 20 minutes to answer a question. Mostly they do not answer; they are not in the business of answering questions or providing information. That is one of the shortcomings. I omit the honourable member for Charlton from that criticism because, when he was a minister, he would always answer questions.

          As I said, question time is very important. It is the focus of the parliamentary day. I am opposed to the rostering of ministers. I believe that the Prime Minister should be there for every question time. It is also important that the people of Australia should be able to see their parliament in action. Question time is the only bit that they get to see, if they are still awake at 12.30 or 1 o'clock in the morning. We should change it, if for no other reason than the convenience of the people of Australia—not the convenience of ministers. People keep telling me that they would like to see question time but that they do not want to stay up that late to watch it.

          The member for Watson said that the Main Committee is a tremendous step forward and I agree with him. I think it is excellent. It is providing opportunities for members to speak about things that are important to them and even more important to their constituents. I approve of what we are doing. However, the member for Watson said that there had been no guillotine. That is absolutely incorrect. He was correct in saying that we had an additional period of time to debate the budget in the Main Committee. Approximately a day and a half extra debating time was provided in this chamber. We did have the guillotine, there was a cut-off point and we did have the gag, which restricted people's opportunity of speaking. Some members did not get the opportunity to speak on the budget. I happen to know because I was one of them. I was down on the list and, because of the guillotine, even with the gag operating, it was still impossible for me to speak on the budget.

          The budget is the most important document and piece of legislation to come before the parliament and I believe every member should be given the opportunity of speaking on it. I also make a suggestion which I made in the committee but which was not incorporated in the report: we should have provision in the Standing Orders for this committee to adjourn on certain occasions and in special circumstances when the Prime Minister of the day is making an important statement. During the last sitting there was an occasion when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was making a major statement and all of us who were involved in the Main Committee operation wanted to be in the House listening to the Prime Minister. As the member for Perth said, it is important that all members have the opportunity to hear major statements, whether they be from the Prime Minister or from the Leader of the Opposition. I appreciate the comment that he made about that. I suggest in future considerations we look at putting in the provision for this committee to adjourn when major statements are being made.

          Ministerial statements is another area we need to tighten up. Too often many mini-ministerial statements are made in answers to questions. I think that is wrong. I do not point the bone only at the present government. I am sure we did the same thing when we were in government although I would hope that we did not. Ministerial statements should be made as ministerial statements because that then gives members of the parliament representing the people of Australia the opportunity to debate them. Statements can be referred to this chamber and that means there is an opportunity for all of us to have a say on them.

          The member for Watson also mentioned the ministerial statements outside the House and I totally agree that, if this happens—and I do not believe it should—they should be tabled in the House so that they can be debated. He mentioned the Justice Statement. I have need of the Justice Statement and only yesterday my staff member was told that we have to buy it from the government bookshop. It is appalling that members of this parliament cannot get hold of such an important parliamentary document as the Justice Statement without having to buy it. I would put that on the record as well.

          . This report is a very worthy additional contribution to the initial reforms that were undertaken as a result of the committee then chaired by the former member for Bonython, Dr Blewett, which I think have very much enhanced the workings of the parliament. I have only been here a relatively short time—a couple of years—but I certainly believe that, in general, those reforms have been very positive. In an overall sense, the comments that are in this report under the auspices of the committee now chaired by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) are very worthwhile.

          I refer to a number of the specific themes that are mentioned in the report and add my views to some of the things that have been mentioned by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and some of the previous speakers. Firstly, it is fairly widely recognised that this Main Committee has been a successful innovation within the proceedings of the parliament. The comments in the report indicate that the Main Committee should be continued as an integral part of the process of debate, consideration of reports, legislation and the like. I would certainly endorse that and endorse the comments that the honourable member for Cowper made in that regard.

          I note the comments that were made in the report with respect to the public gallery and the need to take steps to encourage visitors to parliament to come and watch the proceedings of the Main Committee as well as the proceedings of the House itself. It is fortunate that the members of the committee did not go into any detail about the types of initiatives that we might want to pursue in that regard: perhaps a hot dog stand or one or two other things might assist. But I think it is important to keep these things in perspective—that people do come to see the proceedings of the chambers of the parliament for reasons other than just seeing politicians. It is ultimately the base of our democratic system of government and there is a certain symbolism associated with seeing the parliament, in seeing the House of Representatives, which clearly is not replicated within the Main Committee because the Main Committee is simply an adjunct to the House of Representatives.

          Whether we like it or not, I think that this Main Committee will always be something of a poor cousin to the House of Representatives. Therefore we should not concern ourselves unduly with the lack of attendance and the fact that today, in spite of the fact that I am doing my best to make a good contribution, we have only got a couple of people sitting opposite in the seats available for the public.

          The second point to which I wish to advert is the issue of question time. Both the rostering system and the timing of question time are raised in the report. With respect to the timing matter, I am something of an agnostic. I think that the later time of question time is marginally better for backbenchers in terms of the various other obligations that backbenchers have. I really do not have a particularly strong view about the alternative that has been put forward of 2.30 p.m. rather than 3 p.m.

          However, I do have a couple of views about the question of rostering. One recommendation that is put forward is that the opposition be entitled to demand the presence of one minister at any question time, obviously in order to ensure that, where there is a particular issue running and a particular minister is under pressure, that minister cannot hide behind the fact of not being on a roster on the particular day.

          This is probably a reasonable suggestion, but it needs to be kept in mind that ministers do other things; they do have other responsibilities. Part of the difficulty in pursuing this suggestion is that we would need to ensure that ministers actually had some notice that they were going to be required to attend question time. Otherwise they would not be able to schedule alternative commitments: meetings with delegations, functions and the like. In a sense, the more notice we require the opposition to give a particular minister, the more we defeat the purpose of the exercise in the first place. It then becomes very difficult for the opposition to know two or three days in advance that a particular minister is going to be targeted at a particular question time. Of course, it forces them to telegraph their punches, in a sense, as to what type of theme they are going to be running in question time.

          In essence, it is a worthwhile and constructive suggestion, and I think that the spirit of the suggestion is very logical and fair, but some further work on the detail may be necessary in order to work up an appropriate proposal. I should add that, in a sense, some of the criticisms that are made of the new system of question time by the opposition really only have value because it has failed to make use of the opportunities, by and large, that are offered by the new arrangements. One of the opportunities that is offered by the new arrangements is the ability to concentrate on particular lower profile ministers in more junior ministries, to really give them a hammering and put them under some pressure, to test just how much they are on top of their portfolios and to see whether they are fully across the difficult issues that might be pertinent at the time.

          In spite of those opportunities, the opposition, in my observation, has not yet taken that option. It has not been able to make use of that. I think the opposition would find that it would get greater value out of the new question time arrangements if it started to pay a bit more attention to some of the ministers who very rarely get asked questions by the opposition. I think the statistics would show that a large number of ministers have barely been asked a question by the opposition in the time that this parliament has sat—maybe one or two, but certainly not very many—and that they tend to rely on government backbenchers to ask questions, to keep them occupied in question time.

          The next issue I refer to is sitting hours. I have some sympathy with the honourable member for Cowper about the question of being able to get home on Thursday night. I am certainly of the view that we should conduct our arrangements in such a way as to enable pretty well all honourable members to get home on Thursday night. To me, the great advance made by the reforms under the Blewett committee was to enable the vast majority of honourable members to get home on Thursday night. It means for me that I can now work a normal Friday rather than wandering around in a semi-comatose state, unable to do much more than sign correspondence and look at things coming across my in-tray.

          I would say as an observation on this question of sitting times, schedules and so forth that I am an opponent of the parliament sitting more. It is a mistake that people in the community often make, to assume that the only real or important work that parliamentarians do is actually being in parliament and sitting. In fact, it is probably less important than the work that parliamentarians do in their constituency. It would worry me that, if we spent more time here, we of all political persuasions would end up being more remote, less in touch with our electors and less in touch with what is going on at the grassroots level in our electorates.

          The role of parliament is touched on in this report. A commentator a couple of years ago made an observation that parliament in our system is now little more than an electoral college that every two or three years elects an executive and then wallows in irrelevance. I think that is probably being a bit harsh, but there is a certain degree of substance to that. In a sense it reflects the increasing complexity of government. The emergence of parliamentary committees to some extent reflects those changes, so that a lot of the detailed action in consideration of legislation occurs less often in the chambers of parliament than perhaps it once did. So I think we all have a lot of thinking to do—

One of the things we could look at is how we seem to spend an enormous amount of time debating bills that involve minor, fairly technical amendments to legislation where we have to use the legislation as, in a sense, a heading to enable us to debate broader issues. I suppose there is a necessity for that, but, on some occasions, it also involves the whips of all the major parties asking people to speak and, therefore, to fit themselves into a fairly artificial structure of debate.

          —That is right. That relates to the fact that, as a result of the changed timing of the budget, we now have three major breaks in the parliamentary calendar. The winter break is relatively unchanged—roughly seven weeks—but, because of the need to have a substantial break prior to the budget in order to allow ministers to prepare for the budget, the summer break has been shortened. This has led to a rather ridiculous situation where parliament is resuming sitting later in January. It is absurd that we should all be going back home to shiver in our electorates, those of us who do not go overseas—

          —Those of us who live in the south shiver in our electorates for seven weeks when we could actually be sitting here for at least some of that time, and yet we are coming here late in January. One of the reasons this can cause problems for members—not that any of us are still likely to be on holidays late in January—is that I find that to come cold back to work and start sitting straightaway is often a problem. We get a little build-up of work over the Christmas-New Year period that we have to deal with and it is certainly better to be able to have a week or two of working in the electorate office before the House starts sitting.

          I would normally return to work about that time in January so perhaps it is not such a huge problem. I do think that the recommendation the committee has made, that we start sitting on the first Tuesday in February rather than late January, is a sensible one. It gives a little more flexibility at a time of the year when it is better to be away from this place than it is during winter.

          I also support the committee's recommendation that we should always sit on Mondays, with one exception. I think that is a sensible suggestion. It gets more value out of a week. It ensures that, if we are coming here, we actually get some substantial value from what we are doing and we do not lose a day for no particular reason other than that it is the start of a session. Overall, the report is a very good one, and I commend the honourable member for Charlton and the committee members for their work.

          I suspect the enthusiasm for change—I am not sure; the chairman might tell me—is probably greater on the opposition side than it is on the government side. That would probably be the case no matter who was in government or who was in opposition. Plainly, to a large extent the opposition bears the brunt of the government's decisions in respect of these practices. The government simply has the numbers. In the end, the parliament survives, I suppose, largely because of the conventions and a certain amount of goodwill that exists between the two sides.

I am one who is concerned about question time. I think all of us are: on our side, perhaps for different reasons. It is a pity that question time reflects so badly on us all as members. From our constituents, and particularly from school groups that come here, we all get tarred with the brush that is used in question time, that we are all a mob of louts.

          I try to explain to people—I am sure we all do—that question time is a small part of the day. It is always going to be an active part. It is in the House of Lords; it is in every parliament of the world. I suppose to some extent it gives the opposition a good opportunity to make points, one way or another, in the form of the questions that it asks. In the end, the true purpose of question time ought to be as it is defined, to seek information and to have information provided. I understand that that is its purpose. I think the culture has to change.

          We can talk about changing the rules as far as the Speaker's independence is concerned, but in the end there has to be an attitude by the government—and, hopefully, by us, if we were in government—that that is the purpose of question time, and that ministers will be required to answer questions and know more. The practice of ministers going off, as they inevitably do, to talk about what the opposition did 10 or 20 years ago, or to make a personal attack on the person who has asked the question, is not the intention. If we were in government, I think we would still find it a temptation to do that, but I am hoping that we would not do so. The chairman of the committee, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has been here a lot longer than I have, and maybe it is a bit unrealistic of me to expect that to happen. The government can tinker with it and put bandaids on it and talk about the Speaker and his role until the cows come home; but, until it gets to the fundamentals, it is really only putting bandaids on it.

          The other thing I would advocate—and I think the committee considered it in its previous deliberations—is that dorothy dix questions be banned. I suspect that I probably would go as far as to suggest that only opposition members ought to ask questions of the government, unless there can be some guarantee that we will not get the sort of charade that we get in question time every day. It really is a charade. Even the government blokes here would have to agree that, when they get up and ask a question that they read out and the minister has the answer prepared, that is really not—

When the present government members are in opposition after the next election, they will be just as annoyed about it, and I hope that, as the government, we will not do it. If ministers are asked questions that require them to make statements, then they ought to make statements. As I understand it, the only objection to doing that is that it then becomes a matter of debate. As my colleague who spoke a moment ago said, very often they ought to be matters of debate, as they are the sort of things we ought to be doing in the parliament.

          Sure, it depends a lot on the Speaker and the Speaker's independence, and I certainly would not want to cast aspersions on the current Speaker or on any other, because I think it is improper to do that. Obviously, I would like to somehow see the word `relevant' defined. The Speakers keep throwing it back on the parliament to define it. Maybe it is a difficult thing, but the word has a literal meaning. My experience in the parliament is that, clearly, ministers are very often irrelevant, except in the absolutely broadest interpretation of what `relevance' actually means. That needs to be fixed, and I challenge the government to define what is relevant.

          I know the Procedure Committee has considered in the past whether time limits ought to be applied, and that is another thing that has been done in the Senate. I understand the pros and cons of that; but, on balance, I would probably come down on the side of having time limits applied to answers—and, indeed, to questions, if one wanted to be even-handed. Obviously, there needs to be more time for the answer than for the question. I would very much like to see question time work better. I understand that it has a volatile atmosphere, and that is good. It is healthy, and it reflects the healthiness of our democracy, but it does not reflect very well on us.

          Some of the displeasure about politicians is simply because of the fact that people watch question time on television, or they actually come here and watch. In that case, we know—because we all have the school groups tell us so—that they are quite aghast at what goes on in question time. I suspect that that is why the government will never sell its proposition—if we were to come to the point—that the election of a president should be left to the politicians. All the people I have spoken to, even my friends, say, `Listen, mate: the plain fact is that people will not trust you with that decision. They see the way you behave and they do not want you to be involved in the process.' If there is going to be a president, as the polls have told us, then people are going to want the right—

There are occasions we argue in the parliament that question time could be knocked off. I can understand that, on the odd occasion where we have an extra sitting day or something. But the thing is that the Prime Minister needs to see question time as important. I am not sure how far we would go, but my own view would be that all ministers should be there every question time. I suspect that that is what we will do. But certainly the Prime Minister should be there every question time.

The concept of the Main Committee dealing with uncontroversial matters is a bit over the top because everything is controversial in this place if you want to make it controversial. By nature, if it is before the parliament there is an element of controversy about it.

          The other beneficial change is standing committees. The House of Representatives committee system provides backbenchers with a meaningful role in the parliament and this situation is as a result of the goodwill between the government and the opposition members on the committees and because these committees operate a little bit differently. Many of the reports which are brought back to the parliament are unanimous reports, and that aspect helps. As Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am in a position to know that that committee has received the bulk of references in terms of advisory reports. If success can be measured in terms of the government picking up recommendations, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has achieved a substantial success rate.

Proper resourcing of the secretariat and secondment of officers from the department to assist in specialist reports are the keys to the success of the committee.

          In some instances there will be policy differences, and that is when a number of the recommendations may not be taken up. But in the short time that the committees have been operating the parliament has received reports that not only withstand scrutiny but are gaining international recognition. The reports of the legal committee on the child sex tourism bill and the war crimes bill, as I understand it, have been considered model reports, and members of the parliament in New Zealand and other parliaments are using them as a basis of legislation in those countries. I think that says something about the potential for the operation of those committees.

          One of the underutilised areas of the committees is our ability—and it is pointed out on page 18 of this report—pursuant to the standing orders, to examine annual reports of government departments. Parliamentary committees, particularly in the House, need to do that a bit more often because that is another useful mechanism for suggesting change to the Executive. There is nothing wrong with reviewing an annual report of the director of public prosecutions or the ombudsman, for instance, by bringing them before the committee and going through how the legislation might currently be working. The committees could bring forward reports to the Executive suggesting areas of change.

          On the matter of rostering, there is a comment in this report that there has been criticism of the present roster system. Opposition members of the committee expressed a strong view that the roster should be abandoned, that is, in relation to the roster of ministers for question time. The truth is that there are members of the government who are not well disposed to the rostering system. It is a matter of public record that I was one in caucus who felt that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should be at question time every day. I expressed that view because I believe that he is a master in that forum; that he is the equivalent of what Bradman was to cricket when it comes to question time in the parliament; and that it was absurd to select someone like Bradman in a side as captain and then say that because of his outstanding performances and to even up the score he had better go and sign a few signatures out in the paddock and be used for only part of the time. That is my particular view.

          What members need to understand, and members of the public as well, is that in politics as in everything else it is the majority view that prevails. The overwhelming view on our side of the parliament is that the roster system has proved beneficial. I think what has happened is that the members of the opposition, quite frankly, have not taken the benefits that they should from the roster. They still need to learn a little about tactics and how to launch an offensive, and this rhetoric about `Yes, we want the Prime Minister back in question time every day'—

          The operation of the sin-bin is on page 28 of this report. Question time is theatre, and we are all guilty of participating. I suppose the truth is that, in terms of government members, I would probably be one of the more culpable ones in terms of the interchange and in being quite vociferous from the backbench, because I do not believe in sitting idle on the backbench when the members of the opposition are in the fray.

I think that if there were two or three days in succession where the Speaker or Deputy Speaker, whichever is in charge, threw out three or four government members and three or four opposition members—quite frankly, under the present standing orders that is possible, and I would say that I would probably be the first government member to be thrown out, because I have been given a bit of leniency—then we would get a question time where we could hear a pin drop.

With those comments, I commend the chair in what was a substantial input into this report. He has done a marvellous job. I thank all those members of the committee who hold the parliament dear, as I do. We are very fortunate to have the parliament that we have and the democracy that we have in this country.
