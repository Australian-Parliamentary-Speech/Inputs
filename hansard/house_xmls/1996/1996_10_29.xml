        Has he also seen the unprecedented plethora of editorials from around the region on just this subject? Will the Prime Minister now admit that substantial damage is being done to international perceptions of Australia as a result of an anti&amp;hyphen;Asian, anti&amp;hyphen;Aboriginal debate which he has allowed to run out of control? Will the Prime Minister provide leadership and put a stop to it by declaring such views absolutely unacceptable?

So we can have a noisy, rumbustious exchange over it or we can have calm, intelligent questions asked which are answered in an appropriate fashion. That is an admonition I would deliver to members on both sides of the House if they are interested in pursuing the national interest on the subject. On the other hand, if they want to make a lot of noise they can do so and be judged accordingly.

        I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that I have already forcefully restated, on a number of occasions, the non-discriminatory character of Australia's immigration policy. I would remind the writers of newspaper articles in the region and I would remind any other entrants to this debate—from whatever side of politics or from whatever position they occupy in the Australian community—of something that I said on 8 October 1996 in this parliament in answer to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Let me take the opportunity of saying to the honourable gentleman that the Liberal and National parties will yield to nobody, no political force in this country, in our commitment to racial equality and racial tolerance. Let me make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition that, no matter what arguments there may be about immigration policy in this country, once a person has come to this country that person is entitled to the respect that is
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         due to every other Australian irrespective of that person's background.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        On subsequent occasions, I have said that I find any demonstration of racial intolerance or racial discrimination as despicable and repugnant to the underlying values and beliefs of the Australian community. Those remarks have been made by me repeatedly over the years. They have been made before and since the events that appear, in the minds of the Leader of the Opposition and others, to have triggered the current debate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have never been reluctant to repudiate racism. I will never be reluctant to repudiate racism. I have said on earlier occasions—it is apparently past the recollection of some, including the writers of those articles—that Asian Australians have made an enormous contribution to Australia. I have repeatedly praised, and I will continue to praise, the contribution of Australians of Asian descent to the development of this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that Australia is a tolerant nation. I do not take the black armband view of Australian history, which is so popular in some circles. I believe that the truth about Australia's past should be taught in an unvarnished fashion. I believe that the balance sheet of Australian history is overwhelmingly a positive one. I believe that the balance sheet of Australian history will demonstrate a group of people who have had great achievements, a group of people who have had heroic achievements and have done much to bring about a remarkably enlightened, tolerant and diverse Australian community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me finally say to the Leader of the Opposition that I denounce the distortion and the ignorance of the remarks that I have made which are evident in the articles that have been written in the region. They are wrong. They misrepresent my position. They deliberately misrepresent my position. They could not have been written in full knowledge of what I have said because, as I have demonstrated clearly and frequently over recent weeks, I have denounced intolerance and I have supported a non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me say, though, in the context of that debate, that I strongly support the steps that
        <break page="5976" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the government has taken to change the composition of Australia's immigration policy. I regret the fact that the Labor Party has given notice today of a motion in the Senate to stop the government changing Australia's immigration policy.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Labor Party has given notice of a motion of disallowance. Those changes are not in any way based on race. I hope that, in the conduct of that debate, the Labor Party will not lapse into the falsehood of alleging that it is in any way related to matters of race or matters of discrimination.

        I hope that I would have the support of all members of this parliament when I say to the working men and women of Australia that we would understand if you felt that there were one law for you and one law for the rest of the community.

        The Australian people will always accept reforms, the Australian people will always accept the need for change, if two conditions can be demonstrated. The first of those conditions is that the national benefit is explained and understood.

If you can satisfy the working men and women of Australia that it is fair across the board, that the sacrifice that they might be asked to make on occasions, the contribution they might be asked to make, is matched by the contribution of other sections of the community, they would accept it.

         —I thank the member for Grey for his question. The inflationary pressures have been moderate over the course of this year, and the September quarter for 1996 underlying rate of an increase of 0.5 per cent met a 2.4 per cent underlying rate for the year to September 1996. That means inflation is now back to pre-Whitlam levels, and that it is no longer necessary in Australia to have wages chasing prices. Recently the national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Doug Cameron, said in relation to the claim in the metal industry:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We want to maintain our members' standards of living and their buying power. That means we have to go out and chase wage increases.

        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        The whole point about low inflation is that you do not have to chase wage increases to chase prices. Prices are low. It is no longer necessary in enterprise agreements to factor in expectation of price increases in order to maintain buying power. In fact, it is now necessary to recognise low prices which means that there is no factor to be built in to maintain wage buying power, and wages should be settled on the basis of productivity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Wage outcomes have to take this into account. In an economy exposed to international competition, wage rises that are unreasonable will lead to job losses. This is a point that was made recently by the outgoing chief executive of the MTIA, Bert Evans, who warned that in the metals industry—an industry which is subject to international competition—wage settlements, and particularly a wage claim of 15 per cent over two years, was defying gravity. He continued:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        While they may well secure short-term gains for their members, in the longer term jobs will be lost, investment will be diverted offshore and Australian manufacturing industry will decline even further.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important in this climate to understand the importance of wages based on productivity rather than on expected price movements. Let me make it entirely clear—I think I have said that a few times in this House—that enterprise agreements where wages are based on productivity improvements will lead to real increases in remuneration. It is essential to get the productivity outcomes in relation to wage enterprise agreements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Prime Minister has also mentioned a point that was emphasised by me on a number of occasions in doorstops recently: when it comes to productivity based wage increases and enterprise agreements, that applies to executives as much as it applies to the blue&amp;hyphen;collar work force. As far as the government is concerned, wage&amp;hyphen;productivity outcomes based on restraint, locking in low inflation, are a two-way street. It is a question of not just the work force but management as well realising the potential that they have to lead by example in this area and to set the example in relation to wage outcomes and wage agreements.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In a low inflation economy where we have the opportunity for wages based on productivity outcomes, where we have cooperation, at both the executive and non&amp;hyphen;executive level, we can set up the conditions for an easing in the high interest rates which were the legacy of the failed Keating years. By setting up the opportunity to overcome that monetary policy—the legacy and failure of the Keating years—we can sustain the kind of economic growth which will see the employment opportunities for Australians which are so desperately needed.

        The people who made the selection thought they had picked the best people to do the best job. It is an ambulatory campaign which will be based on ongoing research. It is not committed to a particular type of campaign at a particular time. It is going to change as time changes. The first advertisement was a broad&amp;hyphen;based information set of advertisements in June. The second set of advertisements is more specialised in gun owners' magazines and is currently ongoing.

        Labour market reform was the single biggest failing of the Hawke and Keating governments. Despite 13 years in office, the workplace saw precious little of the sweeping changes which affected other sectors. The prices and incomes accord which locked the union hierarchy and the

        I was not surprised, in a sense. Not only do we have these positive remarks, but even John Maitland of the CFMEU was able to say that he thought the outcome has been one which the trade union movement can live with. I find that a very interesting remark. Of course, time will test the accuracy of the statement.

        The interesting thing is that, in the face of the overwhelming community support for this sensible package which provides real benefits to Australian workers and in light of that very strong community reaction, the Labor Party—as we will find out today—are still proposing to move 351 amendments in the Senate. When we look at the amendments, we find that they are not just holding the policy position they had on 2 March, they are regressing back into the 1980s, back into the 1970s and back into the 1960s. They are opposed to award simplification; they are opposed to non-union agreements. Many of these amendments are not some constructive suggestions to improve the bill but in fact they seek to remove the provisions of the bill and to reinsert the status quo.

        How out of touch can the opposition be with the demands of Australian workers—the workers of Lindsay and elsewhere—for a change which is fair to them and gives them a chance of a job and higher wages. You people are entirely out of sync; you are out of sync even with some of your mates in the trade union movement. Jennie George is quoted as saying that the ACTU now has different strategic imperatives these days compared with the ALP.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For a final quote, let me refer again to John Maitland who said, `I think it is also a sign of the trade union movement looking for more independence from the Labor Party.' That will probably go down as the comedian's quote of the year. But it shows you how out of touch and how irrelevant are the opposition on this important debate.

        If you look at the industrial relations system and the way it has evolved over time, you find that all the focus until recent times has been on awards as they relate to full&amp;hyphen;time male adult employees. As we designed our reform package we were very mindful of that and were concerned to ensure that the industrial relations system was brought up to date and relevant for both men and women. We had constructive and extensive consultations with women's groups. We made a number of changes very early in the piece with respect to our package. When you now look at the entire package, from the point of view of its relevance to women, I do not think there is any doubt that it is relevant and provides a lot of benefits.

         The agreement provides for the retention of existing provisions which allow the commission to make orders to ensure equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value without discrimination based on sex. The allowable matters that can be included in awards have been made clearer and specifically include two issues of concern to women—namely, variations to working hours and notice periods and pay and conditions for outworkers.

         The definition of regular part&amp;hyphen;time employment and the Industrial Relation Commission's powers to make provisions for such employment have been clarified.

If you are trying to balance work and family responsibilities, whether you are male or female, the predictability of your hours is very important in order for you to attend to picking up the kids or whatever the responsibility might be.

         There will also be a number of tests relating to the agreement making processes which reflect good practice in agreement making. These tests will be useful where employers and employees seek to develop a culture of individual agreement making and will certainly assist women in the negotiation of enterprise agreements. In particular, employers will be required to explain the terms of proposed certified agreements to employees. In addition, the Employment Advocate will be required to pay particular regard to the needs of workers in a disadvantaged bargaining position. That would include women, employees from non-English speaking backgrounds, the young, apprentices, trainees and outworkers.

         —I thank the honourable member for Calare for his question. He has been interested in this subject for some time and has spoken on it in the House on a number of occasions. The question goes to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and my relationship with the board, which has been the subject of some public discussion in recent times, as he would have noticed. Upon entering government in March of this year, I approached the members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and pointed out to them that the coalition, when in opposition, had as part of its policy a requirement that members of this board have aviation experience to satisfy our requirement of having adequately experienced people on the board of this very important safety regulator.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I asked those members of the board whether they would be prepared to consider stepping down from their position, in light of our well&amp;hyphen;stated policy launched some time beforehand and which had wide industry support. Following that, I met with the chairman and members of the board. The chairman said to me that if I tried to sack them from the board he would take me to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and tie me up in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for longer than the term of his appointment as Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—which he would be prepared to do.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         For that reason I have subsequently moved to ensure that we can, in part, satisfy our election campaign commitment to have appropriately qualified people on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, by seeking to expand the size of the existing board in order to bring appropriately qualified people onto this very important safety regulator.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But for members of this House to look at the appropriateness of the policy of the coalition, you need only look at the Justice Staunton review of the relationship between the old Civil Aviation Authority and Seaview Air. You will see why it is so important for that very important regulator to have people on the board who have relevant experience and qualifications relevant to administering that very important safety regulator.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we are moving—the bill is in the Senate at the present time and hopefully it will be passed soon—to expand the size of the board so that people who use our commercial air service around Australia can have confidence in the fact that they have a board which knows about the business of aviation and which knows about how best to achieve aviation safety. Unfortunately, of the four people appointed to the board, only one has aviation experience. For that reason, I and other members of the public—and, indeed, members of the industry—cannot have absolute confidence that we have the best qualified board to manage aviation safety regulation in Australia.

         —I am aware of the concerns. In answer to the member's question I would say that on coming to government we had a cost pressure with Medicare that amounted to a 5.9 per cent increase in costs real compound per annum. Recent OECD surveys suggest that if you want to get any handle on medical costs you have to look at the supply side because some 40 to 75 per cent of medical costs in Western countries are generated on the supply side of health, not on the demand side—something most casual commentators on health seem to overlook.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the supply side we have a dramatic oversupply of medical practitioners in Australia. If you look at general practice alone, we have some 4,500 oversupplied in capital cities—1,000 in Sydney and about 800 in Melbourne alone—balanced against an undersupply of only about 500 in rural communities. The danger of this was recognised by the former Labor Deputy Prime Minister,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Brian Howe, who said that uncontrolled entry in general practice and the increase in general practice numbers were a time bomb that had the potential to destroy Medicare.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the important components of this unrestrained increase in general practice was medical migration. It is hard to get an exact number of overseas trained doctors coming to Australia. It is probably around 600 per year in all categories, equivalent to half again of all the medical graduates we produce here in Australia. We find that New Zealand is starting to be used as a backdoor entry into Australia. Last year, 32 doctors from one country alone migrated to Australia using New Zealand as a staging post. The previous government had several attempts to do something about this. In 1992, a 25&amp;hyphen;point penalty was put on the points test in the independent category. That stopped people coming in in the independent category and meant people came in as spouse nominees. Again, the exact number is difficult to define but in 1994 perhaps as many as 450 spouse nominees alone who were medically qualified came into Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have decided to put an end to this. From 1 January next year we will be placing a 10&amp;hyphen;year moratorium on overseas trained doctors accessing provider numbers and accessing general practice training programs. Overseas trained doctors will be able to sit the Australian Medical Council exam. They will be able to have their skills assessed. They will be able to choose to work in a salaried position—and there are 400 of them available in teaching hospitals around Australia; there are 50 of them available in the armed services alone—but they will not be able to access Medicare and go into open&amp;hyphen;ended fee for service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Medical Council exam will be of the same standard as that of a final-year med. student, and we will be giving five years to have their skills assessed, not an open-ended time limit as it is now. We will give them two attempts to have their skills assessed, which is exactly the same for a final-year medical student.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will be making a very small number of exemptions for two important groups. The
        <break page="5985" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         first is for Australian citizens who have gone overseas to study medicine, principally at Cork, Galway and Dublin. The second is for spouses of people coming here who happen to be general practitioners and their partner is an eminent person. I do not wish to do anything to make it harder for well-qualified people to come to Australia. The simple fact of life is that doctors tend to marry other doctors.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are taking a different approach to doctors who are already in Australia. We will not be reintroducing a quota on the Australian Medical Council exam for doctors who are in Australia before 1 January 1997. They will have five years to have their skills assessed. They, too, will have two attempts to pass. If they do pass, they will then have the right to compete freely and in a non-discriminatory way for training positions. If they do not pass, they will have the same options as an Australian medical student who fails final year twice: they can convince the university to take them on for further training, or they can choose another career.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Included in this moratorium are two groups: one is New Zealanders, and the second is full fee paying overseas students. With respect to New Zealand, I have had three discussions with the New Zealand High Commission over the last 12 months, and I have spoken with the Secretary of the New Zealand Department of Health.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will be doing nothing to stop the free migration of New Zealand citizens. We will be doing nothing to stop New Zealand doctors taking a salaried position, taking a training position, or New Zealand specialists of a joint college coming into Australia. But we have no obligations to have unlimited access from New Zealand of people entering fee for service medicine. Under trans-Tasman mutual recognition, medical qualifications have been excluded. That was done late last year. It is essential to do this to stop New Zealand being used as a staging post.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second group included in this moratorium are full fee paying overseas students. Currently, 11 per cent of Australian medical school students comprise full fee paying overseas students. If they marry and change
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         their status, they will be entitled to graduate and to register. There will be a large number of positions available for them to earn a living, but they will not be able to access a Medicare provider number.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To finish, I would say that this is a big change. Some people would say it is tough. In response to that, I would say this: we have been mugs to allow ourselves to be one of the last Western countries to allow unrestrained medical migration. It is killing Medicare. It is killing the cost of Medicare—it is one of the reasons it is going up 5.9 per cent compound a year. Quite frankly, it is simply not fair to Australian students, and it is not fair to those overseas trained doctors who have chosen to come and live here already. It should have been fixed years ago. It has been fixed today.

        There is no easy solution because the lead times to do something are so incredibly long. The previous government had eight separate initiatives to try to get doctors into rural areas, and we have kept every one of them. We foreshadowed four new initiatives: university departments of rural health; medical school vacation scholarships; locum changes to make it easier for locums to get into rural areas; and, finally, funds whereby a local community could set up a trust fund to help one of their own go to medical school. In the budget we implemented all four of those. Subsequent to that, I have announced priority access to the general practice training scheme whereby someone can go to the country for a number of years and then get priority access. That will help country communities.

        I understand the honourable member's concern because many rural communities, particularly in Queensland and WA, rely on temporary resident doctors from overseas. There is nothing in our changes on medical migration that will make it harder for rural communities to get a temporary resident doctor if they can find one.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the point I make is this: up until now there are many doctors who have been trained overseas who are resident in Australia or, in many cases, Australian citizens who have been prevented from having their skills properly assessed. They complain that they could be available to fill these jobs were they allowed to have their skills assessed, but they are being prevented from doing so by an arbitrary quota.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is incredibly unfair that Australian citizens may be prevented from filling these positions, and yet we bring in overseas trained doctors on a temporary resident basis to do it. So, by removing the quota that the previous government had of 200 places on the AMC exam, by allowing all overseas trained doctors who are currently in Australia to sit the exam on a non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory basis, they will have the opportunity to fill those positions if they are up to a suitable standard.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I reassure the honourable member. I cannot promise that this will make a dramatic difference, but I can guarantee it will make it no worse whatsoever, and it will be fair for those people who are here and who are Australian citizens.

         Of course, the most heinous one of all is the provision dealing with the people who want to lodge in Australia, while here illegally, an application form for migration offshore so that they can maintain their illegal status in Australia and pursue an offshore application. The impact of that will be that anybody who wants to migrate to Australia and who thinks that there may be an inability to process their application at a particular time—it might be in the independent category, where there is a four&amp;hyphen;year wait because of decisions taken by the former government—would only have to get on a plane and come to Australia, have somebody lodge an application for them offshore to enter Australia in the independent category and then apply for a bridging visa here in Australia.

         <break page="5991" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform survey of impacts on firms'. That quite extensive study, which took into account a lot of research work done by other government bodies, highlighted the fact that the lack of adequate reform on the Australian waterfront was a major barrier to the future of the Australian automotive manufacturing industry.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, it showed that the Bureau of Industry Economics had surveyed a large number of people in the automotive manufacturing industry and 80 per cent of those people claimed that waterfront reform had either stalled or was going backwards. The survey highlighted the fact that many people in the industry were dismayed at the millions and millions of dollars that had been thrown at the Australian waterfront, at Australia's wharfies—some $450 million being spent on topping up redundancy packages for Australia's retiring wharfies over the period of the government's waterfront program.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The survey also highlighted the fact that people in the automotive industry were calling for further, more adequate and more effective reform of the Australian waterfront. They also pointed out that the inefficiencies and unreliability on the Australian waterfront were costing the automotive manufacturing industry in Australia a great deal in costs and in lack of reliability as a supplier of goods around the world. They highlighted the fact that the automotive manufacturing industry needs to have larger inventory stocks located around the world in order to ensure adequate and reliable supplies could be achieved. The study also highlighted the fact that the number of days lost due to industrial disputes during the period 1994&amp;hyphen;95 had doubled over the period at the beginning of the early 1990s.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was concern by the automotive manufacturers about the high costs involved in using the Australian waterfront and also about the unreliability of the Australian waterfront. That is exemplified today by the fact that we have a dispute on the Australian waterfront because the Maritime Union of Australia is refusing to load a ship on the basis of political prisoners in another country—an issue that you might say is totally
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         unrelated to anything going on here in Australia.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Productivity Commission highlighted a number of things which needed to be done to overcome the inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront. They made three recommendations. The first of those was that the government's industrial relations reforms should be passed and enacted to enable industry to take up the fresh opportunities that those reforms, moved by this government, would offer both the waterfront industry and the automotive industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Productivity Commission also recommended that secondary boycott provisions be reinstated in the Trade Practices Act. This, if you like, is the `protection of the innocent bystander' provision within our industrial relations reforms. The Productivity Commission also called for an increase in competition amongst stevedores.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These things have already been put in train by this coalition government. We are already moving to pass the legislation for industrial relations reform moved by my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations. That is already under way. We are introducing secondary boycott provisions into the Trade Practices Act, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Indeed, we are promoting increased competition on the waterfront.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to that, we have set up a shipping reform group that is looking at reforms in the maritime sector. We have also seen the end of the illegal trans-Tasman accord, which has added 25 to 30 per cent to the cost of moving freight between Australian and New Zealand. All of these things have been done within the first seven months of the coalition government coming into office in March this year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important that the 45,000 people who work in the automotive manufacturing industry in Australia recognise that waterfront reform is crucial to the viability of their industry, their jobs and their future prospects within that industry. It is this government that is acting, through industrial relations reforms and other reforms, to protect and boost the chances of those people maintaining their jobs.

We have had no action from Labor.

Those opposite want to stick to it. They want to stay with the Wally Currans of this world, against the interests of the workers whom they say they represent. You cannot understand it, I know.

The clear inference is that I was suggesting that giving money to World Vision was a waste. I did not say that, nor did I infer it. What I did say and infer was that I could understand the anger of people who gave money to great organisations like World Vision, seeing the political perfidy of regimes in different parts of the world which allows that aid to be literally wasted on the wharves, airports and railways.

That is a matter of distress to me, to the aid organisations and to those people who have given their resources very voluntarily.

The matter of public importance is this government's decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program—yet the Minister for Health and Family Services is not even in the chamber to pay the House of Representatives the courtesy of listening to this debate.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is probably years since we have had a minister squib on defending his decisions on a matter of public importance, especially a matter that involves a cabinet decision and a budget decision to cut $100 million out of dental programs for disadvantaged Australians. There is a good opportunity this afternoon for the government to try to explain to the people of Australia why they think there should be this cutback in dental services for Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To understand the impact of this decision, you really have to go out and visit the dental clinics right round the country. To understand how callous this decision is, you have to meet the people in those dental clinics; you have to meet the people who now rely on Commonwealth funding through the dental health care program. These people rely on the Commonwealth funding so that they have access to emergency dental care. They rely on Commonwealth funding just to pay for the essential preventative dental care that every Australian should have as a right.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When you go to the dental clinics, in places like Springvale in Melbourne, you have a chance not just to meet the dedicated staff who are providing this service to low income Australians, but you also have a chance to speak to the people who live in pain every day because of the poor state of their dental health. These are people who are in pain when they chew their food; whose nutrition suffers because of the state of their teeth; who, due to the state of their teeth, are embarrassed to smile; who are afraid to go out or do not go out because they are embarrassed about the state of their teeth.

          These are the people who will be hardest hit by this minister's and this government's decision to abolish Commonwealth funding for dental health care. To personalise this issue, I would like to quote from an article in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Age
          </emphasis>
          of 1 October that spoke about a woman called Belinda Matthews. The article states:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          Homeless in her 20s, Matthews says she neglected more than her teeth. By her 30s, her teeth were black, rotten stumps. "They were killing me," she says.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
          For the past 10 months, she has managed to eat most foods—her gums were bonier than she expected. But she was unable to find work, with one interviewer suggesting she come back when she had teeth. "My face was all sunken in," she says. "I felt like a bag lady. I've had no confidence."
         </para>
         <para>
          You can see from that quote that this cutback affects people who are in dire need of support from this parliament and this government. People like Belinda Matthews will be the ones who are hardest hit by this government's most callous decision.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Today is the national day of action from people involved in providing dental health care right across the country. Today right across the country people are trying to persuade this government to change its mind. They are trying to persuade the government that people like Belinda Matthews continue to need the help and support of this parliament so that they have access to basic dental care.

          I can do no better than to quote from Michael Challen, the Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, who wrote a very pertinent article in the

         <para font-size="-=2">
          Poverty and illness go together. While much of the answer to this inequity lies outside the health system, it is critical that people on low incomes are able to get adequate health care when they need it.

         <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
          One of the great shames of Australia's generally very good health system has been the lack of access to dental health care for people on low incomes. The Commonwealth's dental health program was introduced to remedy this problem and has been very effective.

           Michael Challen, no-one who would be considered to be biased in favour of the Labor Party, a person who has a reputation for speaking out for disadvantaged Australians, sets it out in that article in the

            Age

           It is not just the people involved in providing dental care in the dental clinics who are opposing this decision.

Let me give an example in the electorate of your colleague the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). In the town of Moree, up until two years ago it was difficult to even recruit a dentist to go to Moree. Moree was without a dentist for three years. It was only the Commonwealth rural incentive program that ensured there would be a full-time dentist in Moree. That dentist covered not only Moree but also Narrabri, Boggabilla and Toomelah—an area that caters for Aboriginal Australians who need access to that emergency and essential dental care. There are a whole series of towns in the New England area that will have reduced access to dental health care because of this government's decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental health care program.

You are not entitled to the chance to get a job. You are not entitled to have good nutrition by eating all the sorts of food you should.'

        The Commonwealth dental health program was established in 1993. It was announced in the dying stages of the 1993 election campaign by Brian Howe, the then Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and Deputy Prime Minister, and by Paul Keating. It was announced on the run. It is interesting that the member for Dobell and the opposition should suddenly now find that there are poor people. I will speak about that later. It took them 10 years to create them and then in 1993 they found them and decided that they would provide some money for low income dental health care.

        When I became the President of the Australian Medical Association early in 1993, the then recently appointed Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, said, `Geez, mate, I don't know what I am going to do about this. I've been lumbered with $100 million with which I am supposed to put public patients into private hospitals and a dental health care plan that Howe's given me.' In fact, it was a $247 million commitment over four years and it was targeted at 1.5 million low income people to assist the states to provide easier access for people with low incomes for dental health services—to provide, if you like, catch-up funding.

        There was no prior consultation with the states—despite what the opposition may say—and the states had funded this kind of dental health care provision for low income people for 93 years.

        The government of the day further cruelly raised the expectations of low income people in particular as it went about borrowing more money and selling more assets to fund what clearly was something the Commonwealth government could not afford. One consequence of this was that the states, in real terms, either froze or reduced their contribution, their responsibility, as the desperate then Prime Minister sought to buy his way back into government. Cruel stuff indeed.

         There is an irony in the Labor Party raising an issue in relation to the poorer members of the community. I will begin by referring to Eslake's research. I am happy to send this on to the member for Dobell because he probably will not read it in the newspaper. Eslake found that, in 1970, 18 per cent of the population in Australia over the age of 15 were in receipt of some kind of social security benefit. By 1995, 30 per cent of the population of Australia over the age of 15 were in receipt of social security benefits. If you take the unemployed out of it, the figure is 24 per cent, almost a quarter of the population.

         Over the decade from 1983 to 1993, while Labor was in power federally, the richest 10 per cent of Australian income earners actually increased their wealth.

That is the top 30 per cent controlling over half of household income in Australia, while the bottom 10 per cent were getting less than 10 per cent of household disposable income. The middle class, defined by Mackay as having incomes between $22,000 and $72,000, had declined from two-thirds of the population in 1976 to less than 40 per cent in 1992—and less now.

         Professor Bob Gregory—described by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) recently in this place as an eminent economist—and Boyd Hunter from the Australian National University examined the period from 1976 to 1991. They found that the average real household income of the poorest five per cent of suburbs had dropped 23 per cent, whilst the richest five per cent had increased their incomes by 23 per cent. The income gap in Australia has so widened that today one in six Australian children are growing up with no employed person in their homes.

In Gregory's view, there were two requirements to cure the developing tragedy. The first was to restore full employment. Unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, is the biggest cause of poverty and social ills. In his address the member for Dobell said that poverty and illness go together.

         Then we look at the work of Professor Ian Ring looking at another group of disadvantaged Australians—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Since 1976 there has been no improvement in any significant health indicator for Aboriginal people. There has been a 20 per cent increase in mortality and morbidity since 1983. If that is concern for low income people, then I am afraid I do not want any more of it.

         I turn to private health insurance. When the then Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, visited the Royal Adelaide Hospital during the 1993 federal election campaign, he said to the Australian people, `You don't need private health insurance. People are wasting their money having private health insurance.' This man was reported to be worth something like $5 million at the time.

         One of my pensioner patients, who was working as a volunteer cleaner in the office of a Labor minister of the day, said to me, `Dr Nelson, I go without food to pay for private health insurance.' There are a million families in this country earning less than $40,000 a year, half a million people on health care cards and 800,000 pensioners that were making, at the time, enormous sacrifices to care for themselves and their families. They were ignored by the previous government.

This is at a time when we averaged 3&amp;half; per cent annual growth each year. All you did with your accord was lock in the very things that prevent growth.

         Symptomatic of the problems that the opposition, including the member for the Dobell, have these days is that when the March national accounts came in at 1.8 per cent, annualised to 4.8 per cent, one of those opposite said to me, `That is lucky, Brendan, you will not have to cut back so badly in the budget.' That is what is wrong. We have believed as a nation, driven by the dreadful leadership of the previous government, that we are a lucky country, that we can sell something each year, borrow more money and maintain an unsustainably high level of expectation of what government can provide.

         Low income dental health care was provided for almost a century by the states. In order to buy your way back into government in 1993 you cruelly went further on the bankcard that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, gave us and borrowed more money to fund a low income dental health care plan. The objectives of that scheme have been met. Some 1.5 million people have been treated. The Commonwealth is working through the states to make sure that they pick up the ball where they dropped it and to see that low income dental health care is provided.

          —As the member for Dobell says, like people who live in the suburb of Campsie in my electorate. In my electorate is the Canterbury Dental Clinic. It has had its funding cut under this program. Unlike the fraud from Bradfield who comes along here and tells us about a couple of people who ran into him in the street in Penrith, I can tell you the name of a real, genuine person, Henry Wicks, who lives in my electorate. He is alive and he is 82 years of age. Henry Wicks was a patient at the Canterbury Dental Clinic, but now people like Henry Wicks will have to wait years before they can get their teeth fixed. Now pensioners, the sick and the unemployed are facing waiting lists of up to seven years to get basic health care. The problem that the member for Bradfield has is that these people do not have any money. For the member for Bradfield, who is a former doctor and wealthy in his own right, and for ministers who earn over $150,000 a year—$3,000 a week—that does not matter.

If they want to get dental insurance, it will cost them $182 a year. For a minister and for someone with unit trusts and $1,500 yachting jackets, that does not matter, but for a person who is on the pension, which is $173 a week, that matters a lot.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this important matter. It is a shame that the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) chose to use most of his 10 minutes for a personal attack on the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) rather than using a factual basis for his arguments. For the record, the Commonwealth dental health program was introduced in 1993&amp;hyphen;94 with the aim of improving access of health care cardholders to emergency and basic dental services. I would like to ask where the waiting lists originated.

        As the honourable member for Bradfield has said, it was a program thought up on the run in the 1993 election campaign by a Paul Keating absolutely desperate to cling to power. It was a program which delivered some services in spite of the confused and hurried way it was put together when Labor unexpectedly won.

         Funding totalling $278 million was announced in the August 1993 budget, and the states were subsequently advised that funding would be provided over four years—not forever or indefinitely, just a temporary measure for four years. I would like to know where the press releases are stating otherwise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Contrary to the pretence of concern by the opposition, the previous Labor government had taken no decision on future funding for the program. The odds are that they, too, would have wound it up this financial year. Dental health care, I would like to remind those on the opposite side, is primarily the responsibility of the states. Those with health care cards will still receive public dental care as before, as will school children in school dental clinics.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I find it absolutely amazing and astounding that the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) continues to single out the issue of widespread concern for the Commonwealth dental health program. How hypocritical of members from the other side to feign concern about budget decisions we have had to take in order to fix their mess of 13 years. Those on the other side simply ignore the widespread concern of all Australians about the disastrous effect of Labor's gross negligence and mismanagement of our economy for the last 13 years.

         Let us not forget $10 billion worth of debt, the highest unemployment level since the Depression and, for the last 13 years under Labor, health ministers who took decisions which put intolerable pressures on Medicare—no social justice, equality or access. Unless something was done—hard decisions made by our government—Medicare would have been brought to the brink of collapse.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Waiting lists under Labor had blown out, not only in the dental area but throughout the public health system. There had been an exodus under the previous government from private health insurance because of their own failed policies, further exacerbating the huge crisis in our public health system which had developed over the past 13 years—not in the past six or seven months since March but 13 years. The most vulnerable are our elderly and those on lower incomes with children who have been making huge sacrifices to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          maintain private health insurance because they had lost confidence in the Labor government to facilitate the basic needs of health care.

         During the lead-up to the election in March 1996, I doorknocked many houses as well as many retirement villages and nursing homes. From talking to many older residents in my electorate of Makin, I found that one of their major concerns was waiting lists in public hospitals. It has meant that many were anxious to have health insurance, even to the extent of not spending their money on food to pay their private health premiums. This was also happening to many young families with children in my electorate of Makin. What an indictment of the previous government's wilful neglect of not only the private health system but also those who are the most vulnerable members of our community—the frail, the elderly and the chronically ill.

         As a sole parent, part-pensioner and low income earner, and having worked as a nurse in the areas of aged care and surgical nursing over the past 15 years, I can understand the many concerns of our chronically ill, frail and aged. These are some of Howard's battlers whom we will be genuinely looking after through our private health insurance incentive scheme. Once more, an incoming Liberal government has to clean up the mess of a Labor government, as happened in my home state of South Australia with its $8 billion State Bank debt.

       I would like to make a few comments in regard to this matter. This motion is intended to grant a request conveyed to the House in two letters tabled by the Speaker yesterday. The letters are from Arthur Robinson &amp; Hedderwicks, solicitors, and seek permission
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        of the House to adduce in evidence certain extracts from the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        . The extracts concern debate on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 1995. Arthur Robinson &amp; Hedderwicks act for the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd which is, we gather, seeking leave to intervene in two matters scheduled to be heard before the High Court. These are the proceedings listed in the notice of motion.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The motion does not address the substantive issue of the privilege itself. That is a matter governed by the law as expounded in section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The well&amp;hyphen;known immunity of parliamentary proceedings from being impeached or questioned in court is inherited from article 9 of the Bill of Rights.
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        (Quorum formed)
       </emphasis>
       However, section 16(5) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act does in fact state that neither the 1997 act nor the Bill of Rights is taken to prevent the admission, et cetera of parliamentary records in connection with a matter arising under section 57 of the constitution or the interpretation of an act.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       While there is some judicial authority for the view that the permission of the House is not required on the procedural question of the actual production of the parliamentary records as distinct from the substantive question of the use to which they can be put, the House has never formally abandoned the position that permission should be sought—hence today's motion.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There are a number of precedents for permission being granted. In fact, two instances have arisen in the present sittings, although in each case the request concerned committee records. Further background on these matters is contained in
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        House of Representatives Practice
       </emphasis>
       at pages 690 and 698 for the information of members who would like to look that up. I am completely confident that, if it grants the request for leave, the House will be acting in full accord with the precedents which exist.

         —I wish to make some further points about this very important issue on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. As I indicated last evening, our principal objection to this legislation is the fact that it refers specifically to funding being obtained through the part sale of Telstra. So all those clauses in the bill and those observations which refer to the sale of shares in Telstra are ones to which we object.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We had a very clear suspicion that this Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill and the linking of it with the part sale of Telstra were a ruse and that this course of action had been engaged in by the government during the election campaign as a sop to the environment movement but more importantly as a way of cynically engineering support for the part sale of Telstra which otherwise, I think the government recognised, was not palatable to the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This has been given some currency by a recent report in what appears to be, and indeed I am told is, a reputable science notebook called
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Science technology
        </emphasis>
        , a monthly round&amp;hyphen;up of science and technology in Australia. In it an article headed, `Natural Heritage Trust a fraud admits coalition senior adviser', goes into some detail about precisely how that fraud was engineered and perpetrated on the Australian people. That adds insult to injury, in my view. It is a bad idea, quite apart from these claims, but I want to put them on the record. The article says:
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical political fraud.
        </para>
        <para>
         That phrase, `blatant and cynical political fraud', is a quote from a senior government adviser. He says the policy, the coalition's claimed answer for rectifying Australia's enormous environmental problems, was, as he puts it, `invented overnight' as a means of attempting to soften potential public reaction against the planned sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra. That is something certainly that we believe to be the case, and it now appears that the government's ruse has been revealed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The plan had been essentially devised—and, again, I quote the adviser—`as a purely political exercise' by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, and had then been `imposed'—again using the adviser's words—on the former shadow minister for the environment, Senator Rod Kemp, and subsequently, he says, on the current Minister for the Environment, Senator Robert Hill. These are all claims made by the senior adviser.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He said that senior coalition MPs `openly joked behind closed doors' about the policy and admitted to the fact that it `couldn't possibly' in its current form or size make any serious impact on the nation's massive problems of land degradation, ailing rivers and loss of biodiversity. That is straight from one of the government's own current advisers. He said the extent of the deceit had `sickened him'—and those are his words—and a number of other coalition staffers who are genuinely concerned about the national environment for the sake of their children and the nation's long&amp;hyphen;term future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This shows that the government was not genuinely concerned. They regarded it as a joke to be laughed about behind closed doors. An admission of major significance because it confirms what a lot of people thought—that this was a very strange link to make between a very important area of government policy, namely, the protection of the environment, and the sale of a public asset. It was always a lever to be used in the most cynical fashion. And now we have revelations that this was
         <break page="6012" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          contrived, basically, in the interests of the part sale of Telstra and not the environment.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the same article this journal was told by the adviser:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We were appalled at the lies and deception involved with this issue. It's an exercise just based on one thing—finding a way to sell off Telstra.
        </para>
        <para>
         He goes on:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The linkage to the environment is just a sop designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try to blackmail other parties and the general community into accepting it.
        </para>
        <para>
         The environment movement generally have been awake up to that. Without this confirmation, they were still very much aware of the fact that this government did not seriously commit itself to either the Natural Heritage Trust or its funding. The adviser goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Anyone who looks at the figures can quickly see the Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical political fraud. There is simply no way the interests from the $1 billion supposed to be diverted from Telstra sale could possibly pay to rectify the enormous environmental problems confronting Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         And it goes on. I want to put this on the record because it is a very important confirmation of a serious problem: a cynical exploitation of the strong concern that Australians feel for the environment in an attempt to force the part sale of Telstra. An attempt that appears to have failed and the government now is left with no environment policy at all. It did not have any credibility to begin with and it certainly has none now.

         —I want to continue to point out that there was a very clear breach of undertaking by the government in relation to various programs which were supposed to be funded in the budget. During the election campaign, the government said very clearly—and it has subsequently repeated it—that it would maintain the environment budget at its current levels. Indeed, that was a very explicit promise made by the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He promised that there would be no cuts to the environment budget and that all of the funds from the part sale of Telstra would be in addition to Labor's funding. The then shadow minister made much of a boast that, as a result of this, he would be able to double Labor's expenditure on the environment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to the funds from the sale of Telstra, the coalition promised to spend $84 million on environment programs in the 1996-97 budget. Both of those promises were clearly breached, because there was in fact a 13 per cent cut in environmental spending and none of those extra dollars were applied.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The result is that, even if the part sale of Telstra were to proceed, environment funding would be starting well behind. As I pointed out last evening, it would be likely that the broken promises—that is, the failure to maintain funding plus the failure to apply the additional funds that were promised—would
        <break page="6014" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         lead to $275.6 million in broken promises over the four years. When you look at the so-called extravagant, extensive funds to be made available from the sale of Telstra, you see that there has been a very significant breach of what the community was led to understand.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will just give a couple of examples of those 13 per cent cuts. The Australian Heritage Commission budget has been cut by 15 per cent, and most of that has been in cuts to community programs. The commission's national estate grants program has been cut from $5 million to $1 million. This, of course, will hit community based environment and heritage programs very hard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It ill behoves coalition members to come in here and talk about the new programs that might be funded under the Natural Heritage Trust when existing programs are being cut to ribbons. The reduction in funding means there will be a devastating effect on the identification and conservation of Australia's natural cultural and indigenous heritage—something which the ministers clearly do not care about.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are all well aware of the very significant cuts that were made from government source funding to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the shortfall of $3.5 million to be made up from a big increase in the reef tax, from $1 to $6 a head—and we all know the impact that that is likely to have on the Queensland community and the tourism industry there.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was a very significant cut to the Environment Protection Agency. Again, from a government who claims to care about the quality of water and clean coasts and clean seas, that very significant cut means that the Commonwealth has very little capacity to monitor and improve the protection of our environment. There was a 21 per cent cut in last year's budget to the Environment Protection Agency. The cuts relate largely to the abolition of a $5 million paper recycling initiative—something which I would have thought was very sensible—to encourage the recycling of high grade waste paper. Funding for cleaner production was also cut. That again is something that is entirely against the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         grain of what the government claims in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are also very significant cuts to the Environment Strategies Directorate, which impact particularly on the directorate's capacity to manage Australia's world heritage areas. So it is not much good trotting out a whole new set of initiatives when existing ones of great importance are being cut so significantly. The budget cuts in that area include a $10 million cut in payments to the states for management of world heritage properties—a cut that is being matched by the states, because they say, `If the Commonwealth is withdrawing, so will we.' There is a cut of $2 million over two years to the mahogany glider Sugar Coast rescue package, and a cut of $5.3 million to the Queensland wet tropics planting scheme. Again, all of these things are alleged to be picked up by many of the initiatives in the so-called heritage trust, yet they are being cut from behind. So the net benefit of this funding, even if it were to be applied, is very small.

        If you compare what is to be applied with what Labor was spending and promised during the election campaign, the part sale of Telstra—$8 billion with $1 billion going to the environment—results in a net benefit over those expenditures of less than $50 million a year.

         —Again, our objection to this clause is that the crediting of amounts to the reserve refers to $1 billion to be derived from the partial privatisation of Telstra. There are a great many reasons to object to the part privatisation of Telstra from the point of view of community service and the fact that this should be community infrastructure. As a matter of principle I strongly object to the part privatisation of Telstra, and I believe a great many other Australians do too.

Indeed, you would get the support of every member of this House and over 80 per cent of the community. It is very clear, no matter which poll is taken or when, that the community understands that a failure to address environmental problems leaves a very substantial legacy to future generations and that in some areas these problems are so great that failure to address them now will lead to considerable exacerbation so that additional funds will have to be provided in future. Dry land salinity in my own state is a good example.

        Nowhere in the past have we seen governments prepared to link the sale of an asset in this way with decent funding for an important government priority. In every opinion poll that has been taken pre or post elections, the environment is one of those issues that comes up near the top. Something like 80 per cent of Australians will give you a `yes' to the importance of the environment and, in particular, to things like clean air and water, anti&amp;hyphen;pollution measures, protection of our forests, biodiversity and the like.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Just recently the minister was keen to trumpet that roughly 80 per cent of Australians—I have not got the exact figure—were supportive of the protection of wilderness areas. So you do not need to convince the Australian community that the environment is important. But to use that concern in the way that it has been used by the government to justify the sale of Telstra is cynical and abusive in the extreme, because it takes a deeply held conviction and tries to use it for a very tawdry political purpose. In this case, to say to them, `You can't have a decent environment program; we will not provide additional funds for these very serious problems that you care about unless you agree to something that you really don't like, that you object to for another set of reasons.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have said in this place before that I think it is unconscionable that you tie policy areas together in this way. It really is equivalent to saying to people, `If you want a decent education for your children or if you want
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         access to decent health and aged care services, you can only have that if, for instance, you agree to the sale of Australia Post.' Apart from anything else, after a while you run out of assets to sell off in order to provide for the ongoing costs of government. That is a further reason for objecting to this legislation, in that it purports to be about capital expenditure but a lot of what these funds will go towards are problems that will go on and on.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, the minister said it himself last night in addressing this bill. He said very clearly that these problems were not going to go away in the short term. The nature of a capital investment is frequently that it is one&amp;hyphen;off and it is genuinely capital. The nature of recurrent expenditure is that it is addressing a continuing problem which requires funds to be appropriated every year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I simply say to the government that the sale of Telstra is no way at all in which to solve this problem. Their deception on this issue has been exposed by one of their own advisers. As I indicated earlier, it is quite clear that this was a purely political exercise—as that adviser said, dreamt up by Andrew Robb and imposed on the ministers responsible for the environment both before and after the election. It has been seen—again, as that adviser said—as a joke.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sadly, it is a very sick joke that has been perpetrated on the Australian people. It is likely now that the Senate will give the thumbs down to the part sale of Telstra, and for the very good reason, as identified by the Senate committee that looked into the heritage legislation, that it will leave the government with no decent funding for the environment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Not only will there be no funds from the part sale of Telstra but also there already has been a 13 per cent cut to environment funding. Programs are going downhill very quickly. There was a range of initiatives which the government might have put in place in good faith and which would have had bipartisan support—and, indeed, did during the election campaign. We had committed ourselves to very similar programs but they were to be funded out of consolidated revenue and would have been part of the ongoing commitment of government, not some clever political trick.

        Again, it is important to underline the fact that we regard the link between the part sale of Telstra and the environment as something that should be repudiated by every reasonable Australian—and I think it has been. All of the environment groups with which I have met—initially, with the exception of the Surfriders Association, which perhaps has a broader agenda—were very cynical about this particular link and, as time has gone on, have become more so. When Surfriders saw that funds that might have been provided out of consolidated revenue for the clean seas initiative were part of the budget cuts, they too saw through the government's strategy. I do not think that there is now a single voice in the environment movement standing up behind this proposal.

        Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting with a number of representatives of the World Wildlife Fund and the New South Wales Farmers Federation who put forward a very sensible initiative—one which we introduced in Western Australia—to enable the fencing off of private land to protect remnant vegetation.

        That is the sort of initiative that people can understand, get involved in, and see tangible results from. However, people will not get involved at the community level, involving considerable cost on their own part—be it the cost to a farmer of labour to provide the fencing or the cost of volunteer labourers of getting involved in the Greening Australia program and the like—if they see a government which is disinterested, which regards the

        I must say that, like a great many Australians, I have watched with some interest a ploy, which seems to be working for the moment, of a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who is driven almost entirely by poll results. It is polling—which has been done, it would appear, almost on a daily basis by the Liberal Party headquarters—that drives the views of the Prime Minister and the ministers and their behaviour on a great many issues.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact that we have not heard a lot recently about the sale of Telstra, the fact that it has dropped down the agenda in the Senate, is an indication not only that it is likely to go down there—at least, some pundits are suggesting that it will—but also that the government has realised that it is not exactly a winner. At least we can be thankful for that feedback from the community, that they are not happy with the government proceeding in that direction.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I hope that the ministers responsible will now reconsider what it is that they should be doing for the environment. The difficulty is that they have brought down this heroic budget which has cut a whole range of sensible programs. There will not be an opportunity, unless there is a mini&amp;hyphen;budget, until next year to remedy the wrongs that have been inflicted on environmental funding.

        The environment movement in Australia will not listen to this government for a very long time, nor will they cooperate on joint programs or be available to support the government in developing decent policy, because they are extremely cynical now about the government's intentions. Based on the government's record, I think that cynicism is justified. We need look only at the last few months to see that it is not just the cuts in the budget that would produce that cynicism but also a range of decisions that have gone entirely against the interests of decent environmental management.

        In the Senate committee it was very clear that there was no real capacity for the Senate or the House of Representatives to really examine the expenditure of the Natural Heritage Trust in the way that they do with appropriations. Decisions by the ministers jointly could be made and only reported at a later date to the parliament rather than in anticipation. The benefit of having it on consolidated revenue is that members can look at it, judge it and vote on any application of funds before those funds are applied for the most part.

        The way in which the Natural Heritage Trust will be operated will mean that members of the House will be unable to look at the expenditure until after it has occurred, which in many cases will be too late. We thought it was important to put a sunset clause in this bill to ensure that it came back to the House for proper examination before there was any further expenditure. A lot of this may now prove to be academic, but we nonetheless think it is an important provision and one which the government should accept.

        While most of the elements of the preamble are not objectionable and we do not object to them, there are some elements that we thought needed to be modified, particularly because of the definition of `natural capital'. It is not a definition that one finds anywhere else in the legislation or indeed in environment policy. It was something that was contrived for the purposes of getting the government off the hook regarding the proceeds of sales of public assets.

         During the election campaign, they made it very clear that if they were going to sell a public asset it would be only to retire debt or to purchase another capital asset. What they have done in this case is nothing of the kind. While it might be said that some of these programs—for instance, the purchase of land for the purpose of inclusion in a national estate area—have the characteristic of capital, none of the others do. Most of them are clearly recurrent expenditure and have been so identified by successive Treasurers and successive governments.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Programs of a similar kind have not been included as capital expenditure in past budgets, nor should they be in this bill. The preamble compounds that error by referring to this transfer of investment in technological capital to an investment in national capital, as if that was what was happening. The transfer of investment in technological capital is one thing, but the so&amp;hyphen;called natural capital is something else altogether.

        The Labor opposition will oppose these measures because they represent broken promises on the part of the government, and the Labor opposition will oppose them because they are unfair. We will oppose them because we believe access to essential health services is a key responsibility of the national government. In one of his headland speeches to the Australian Council of Social Service in October last year entitled `Fair Australia', the then opposition leader and current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised `to maintain the real value of pensions and other social security benefits'. This legislation breaks that promise. This legislation shows that the Prime Minister could not be trusted last October.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Prime Minister prides himself on having higher standards than the rest of us. An important test of the trust which many pensioners placed in him is this particular legislation. For every pensioner out there who decided to trust the Prime Minister's word, for every pensioner who decided to give the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister a go, their faith and their trust have been betrayed with this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to turn to the first measure, which increases the cost of pharmaceuticals for pensioners. We think this is the worst measure, mainly because of that direct effect on pensioners. The Prime Minister in this legislation is forcing pensioners to pay $3.20 for each prescription, which is an increase of 50c for each script. For the first time this measure breaks the link between what pensioners have to pay and the compensation they receive through their pension.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Until the election of this government, no pensioner was worse off because they needed medicines. When Labor introduced the co-payment for pharmaceuticals, we guaranteed that all pensioners would get more than
        <break page="6019" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         enough in compensation. Those pensioners who needed 52 or more prescriptions a year did not lose a cent. If you did not need that many scripts a year, you were a little bit better off.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government has changed all that. This government has destroyed the principle that pensioners should not have to eat into their limited resources for essential medicines. Now pensioners will have to dig into their pockets every time they need to go to the chemist. The dishonesty about this legislation and this measure is continued in the second reading speech of the absent Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I quote:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to note that the `safety net' arrangements under the PBS are not changing, thus maintaining the high level of protection afforded under this scheme. The annual concessional limit to access the safety net will remain as 52 times the patient contribution at $166.40.
       </para>
       <para>
        The minister tries to argue that `it is important to note that the safety net arrangements under the PBS are not changing'. It takes a twisted form of logic for the minister to argue that an increase in the safety net for pensioners from $140.40 to $166.40 is no change. That is obviously not true. Either the government has set out to deliberately mislead this House and the Australian people or this minister does not understand the impact of the measures that he has introduced into this parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me give an example. An age pensioner, perhaps living off nothing but the base pension, can reside in a nursing home and as a result pays 87.5 per cent of their pension for their accommodation. This leaves that nursing home resident living off the base pension with around $30 a week to pay for their toiletries, clothing, telephone calls, transport arrangements and pharmaceuticals. If these pensioners have to fill a prescription once a week or more—and tens of thousands of pensioners do—then because of this government's callous and dishonest changes they lose $26 a year, which represents almost one week's income for the pensioner residing in a nursing home living on the base pension.

        If this is the case, then all Australians must not include older people. Instead of giving older people "a fair go", this Budget seems to have targeted older people who are frail, sick and one of the most vulnerable groups in our community.

        That is what a newspaper, the voice of pensioners, in my state says about these changes.

        But pensioners will not be the only ones hit by this measure. Families too will be hit by this attack on access to essential medicines. The Howard government is lifting the maximum cost of pharmaceuticals to $20 a script for families. If a parent suffers from high blood pressure or diabetes, or if a child has asthma, families may need four or more drugs a week. These families will have to find $80 a month to pay for their medicines. Families will have to pay up to $2.60 more for every prescription and could be almost $100 a year worse off.

         I would like to again take issue with a comment that is contained in the minister's second reading speech. He claims:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Members will note that many general users of the scheme will now reach the safety net limit quicker, using fewer prescriptions.
        </para>
        <para>
         I hope that the department did not write that, because there is very clear attempt to mislead this House in that second reading speech. The claim that general users will now reach the safety net limit quicker using fewer prescriptions obviously indicates that, because families will be paying more, they will reach the safety limit quicker. To suggest in some way that people will be better off because they will be paying more for their scripts is quite ludicrous. I think the minister would have a great deal of trouble trying to convince some of the families in his own electorate that they will be better off paying $20 for a script rather than $17.20. But if the minister wants to try then he is welcome to do so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While the unintended honesty of that particular measure is welcomed, it would appear that this is being trumpeted as some virtue of the government's policy. It is quite ridiculous to suggest that ordinary families will be pleased to reach the safety net faster because they are required by this government to pay more for their prescriptions. This attack on families is the sort of thing which is hidden away in this government's slick and sneaky budget. Big neon signs announce the family tax initiative, but higher prices for medicines are one example of the many measures which eat away at any benefits families may be entitled to. This measure will take $180 million from the pockets of general users and ordinary Australian families, in addition to the $323 million which the first measure takes away from pensioners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also hidden away in the fine print of this bill is the third measure we oppose—that is, a sneaky change which saves $56 million at the expense of those who need medicines and which goes a long way to showing the difference in the approach to social issues between the Labor Party and coalition.

         The fourth measure in this bill, which we do support, is the restriction of pharmaceutical benefits to Australian citizens, permanent residents and visitors to Australia from countries with which we have reciprocal health care agreements. Visitors from other countries should not expect the taxpayers of Australia to subsidise their pharmaceuticals while they are on holidays in Australia. When Australians travel overseas, I would hope that they do not expect other countries to subsidise their medication. We would expect those expenses to be covered by travel insurance. Visitors to Australia with travel insurance will be able to claim these costs back from their insurer. That is the appropriate way in which these costs should be met.

         While the opposition supports this measure, I would like to seek an assurance from the government that there will be a practical and workable approach taken by the Health Insurance Commission in dealing with pharmacists on this issue. My understanding from the government and the department is that pharmacists will be expected to check that a person is eligible for the subsidies that are provided under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to Australian citizens, permanent
         <break page="6021" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          residents and also visitors to Australia from countries with which we have reciprocal agreements. I would be concerned if onerous and bureaucratic obligations were placed on pharmacists in implementing this particular decision. When the minister sums up at the end of the second reading debate, I would appreciate an assurance from him that new, onerous, bureaucratic obligations will not be placed on pharmacists as a result of this provision.

         I would also be interested in the minister's view on what extent Australia should extend the subsidies available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to all eligible overseas representatives. I can understand that ambassadors from other countries to Australia might be entitled to certain rights under international treaties. But I am not quite sure if Australian diplomats serving in other countries also expect their families and staff who work at overseas embassies to be entitled to all of the pharmaceutical concessions that nationals of those countries receive.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think there is a question as to whether PBS concessions should be extended not only to ambassadors from other countries serving in Australia but also to their children and to the staff who work at those embassies in Australia. I am sure many of those countries can afford to meet the cost of their pharmaceuticals, or perhaps countries should require staff who are serving at overseas embassies in Australia to have sufficient travel insurance to meet those costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would also like to take this opportunity to place on record some serious concerns I have about one other measure that is referred to in the legislation. I have grave concerns about the government's intention to consider de&amp;hyphen;listing important drugs used in the treatment of hypertension. I am concerned that the government will approach this review with the same cold-hearted accountant's viewpoint which led to the atrocious decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program that we have discussed earlier today. I can assure the minister that the opposition will keep a very close eye on developments in this area and will be active in alerting appropriate community groups to this threat so that, unlike
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          many other measures in this budget, the groups affected may actually have an opportunity to comment on a policy before the government locks itself into defending appalling social policy.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I reiterate that the opposition will oppose three of the measures contained in the legislation but will agree to the fourth measure. The three measures which we are opposing are the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals for pensioners, the increase in the cost of essential medication for families and the changes in the indexation rounding rules which will hit families and pensioners.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We believe that, with this particular legislation, the government has broken the promises that it made before the election in saying that pensioner concessions would be maintained. We believe that the Prime Minister has betrayed the trust he sought from large numbers of pensioners. For many pensioners in my own electorate, this is one measure in particular that is often raised with me. I would say to the Prime Minister that many people in my electorate, who trusted him and thought that he was entitled to have a go, will hold this against him come the time of the next election. For all of these reasons, the opposition opposes the measures that I have outlined in my speech today.

I would like, first of all, to respond to a couple of the points that the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) made. In terms of honesty, we are in a situation where we were not told by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who was then finance minister, that we had a $10.3 billion deficit. We were aware that the country had reached a point of record debt—with net foreign debt in excess of $180 billion—and that we were expending four per cent of our gross domestic product servicing our debt and equity obligations. We are now aware that the previous government in five successive budgets accumulated $69 billion in debt, taking our total debt level in government to something like 19 per cent of gross domestic product. That is the environment in which the

        As I said earlier in the MPI, two elderly pensioners in Lindsay when I was there told me to pass on to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that they were happy to pay a bit more for their drugs if it meant that it helped the country get out of trouble. I remind the House that the government has made a commitment to pensioners to continue to index pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We have also said in the forward estimates that there will be continued indexation of pensions twice yearly.

        The other point that ought to be made is that the member for Dobell is new to this area and I can understand that he is still coming to terms with it. Under the previous government there were changes in the rounding rules, either in the 1992 or 1993 budget, for the Medicare benefits schedule. I think it is quite unreasonable to say that the new government's policy is outrageous when similar kinds of policies were pursued by the previous government.

         —It needs to be pointed out that whilst pharmaceutical benefits are important so too are the benefits that people receive when they visit the doctor. One is no more or less important than the other. If you follow the logic of the opposition, you would consider the doctor's visit to be more important. They felt that a co-payment for that was unacceptable, but they believed that a co-payment for pharmaceuticals was quite acceptable.

         This bill implements budget measures to reduce the growth in outlays under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme lists medications that are considered to be essential to the treatment of commonly serious, acute and chronic condi tions. Unfortunately—and we all own this problem no matter which side of politics we are on—the pharmaceutical benefits scheme outlays are currently growing at an alarming rate and well in excess of both the consumer price index and the underlying inflation rate.

        At the time of the March federal election, PBS outlays were projected to rise by 50 per cent over the next four years from a base of $2.7 billion, and that was in the absence of any new drugs being listed. The key measure contained in the bill is an increase in the maximum patient contribution from $2.70 to $3.20 per item for pensioners, concession cardholders and safety net prescriptions, and from $17.40 to $20 for general prescriptions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not a decision that anybody would relish. However, if the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is to survive and if those in need are to continue to have affordable access to essential pharmaceuticals, it is absolutely essential that the beneficiaries of the scheme make a greater contribution to the cost of the drugs for which they are the primary beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In this regard, it is worth recalling that in 1990 when the then Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, introduced the pharmaceutical co-payment he said of the measure `anything that is free leads to overuse'. The scheme works in the following manner. Pensioners receive $140 annually in addition to the base pension. The purpose of this payment is to cover 52 prescriptions at the existing cost of $2.70 each. After 52 scripts, subsequent drugs are free. The effect of the budget increase from $2.70 to $3.20 would be that it requires pensioners who consume 52 prescriptions to pay a total of $26 over the course of a 12&amp;hyphen;month period when the concessional safety net of $166.40 is reached. Subsequent medications will be free.

         There are two points that need to be made. The first is that the average number of prescriptions is around 31. Therefore, most concessional patients will not be spending more than is provided by the government, specifically for the PBS listed medications. The second point is—and again I emphasise this—that there are elderly people and pensioners, no matter how difficult their circum stances, and I can assure you that I have a very good idea how hard it is for them, who nonetheless are prepared to accept the fact that they, along with others, will make a contribution to the recovery of the economic situation in which this country finds itself after the profligate spending of the previous government.

        Last year the Keating Labor government increased the general safety net threshold from $400 to $600. It is interesting that the member for Dobell seems concerned about the fact that people will reach that threshold more easily. He neglected to mention that the previous government actually increased it by 50 per cent. This will not change under these proposals. It means that although the non&amp;hyphen;social security beneficiary or working person, the person who has an income, will be required to pay a maximum of $20 for PBS listed drugs—that is up from $17.40—the safety net threshold will be reached more quickly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indexation of patient contributions and the safety net threshold will move to 1 January each year and will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10c. Again, this is a measure that is consistent with that of the previous government, at least in terms of the Medicare benefits schedule. These measures will provide significant savings to the budget. In total over the four years of the forward estimates it will be $608 million, half of which, $308 million, will be from the increase in the concessional co-payment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important that Australians appreciate that this is the product of volume. Eighty per cent of prescriptions for PBS items are for concessional payments. It is not that a small number of pensioners will be required to contribute the $308 million in the forward estimates, but there is a very large number of concession cardholders whose relatively small contribution over the course of a year will result in significant savings to the pharmaceutical benefits schemes and growth in outlays and therein ensure the viability of the system.

         written last year and of those 118 million were subsidised by the PBS. Some critics of the medical profession, including former health ministers, and I note that one of them is in the chamber, have suggested at different times that there is rampant overprescribing of drugs to an unsuspecting public driven by the promotional activities of pharmaceutical companies. I think it is worth putting the issue of consumer demand into perspective—and I speak as someone who actually spent 13 years working as a family doctor, much of it in one of the poorest socioeconomic areas of Australia. There is a demand for pharmaceuticals which at times appears to be insatiable.

        I go back to the then Treasurer who, when introducing the scheme six years ago, said that anything that is free leads to overuse. The expectation of people in the community of what benefits drugs will provide to them is at times quite unrealistic. So many times I have had people come along to see me; they describe themselves as having the flu, and they say, `I've come to nip it in the bud,' the implication being that there must be an antibiotic or some other pharmaceutical which is going to cure their problem when, of course, there is not any such cure for it.

        The consumer driven aspect and also at times the provider driven dimension of prescribing and the growth of pharmaceuticals have led to something that ought to be disturbing to all members of the parliament. Dr Peter Collignon from Woden Valley Hospital has found that basic antibiotics over the last six or seven years have become considerably less effective than they were in the past. Equally, I wish I had a dollar for every person who has said to me, `I have come to see you because I saw the doctor down the road and I took my 18&amp;hyphen;month&amp;hyphen;old baby along who has a runny nose and a terrible cough and he didn't give me anything for it.' Again, there is the expectation that there must be a cure of some sort, that the doctor must provide some sort of prescription before the person feels satisfied.

She said, `My doctor is so much better now that I have gone to one who bulk bills and I don't have to pay anything for it.' I said, `What do you mean by that?' and she said, `I used to pay $25 to get a lecture about why I did not need diet tablets and now I go to a doctor who does not charge me anything and he just gives me whatever I want.' I leave it to members of the House to decide whether they think that is necessarily an appropriate expectation or medical practice. I remember one patient saying to me that her doctor was so much better since he started providing a free service for her because before he did that he would see the child with an ear infection only once and now he sees that same child three times.

        Similarly, in the area of pharmaceuticals there needs to be seen, contrary to what I understand the opposition will put up in this debate, a degree of social and educational responsibility in what the government is doing with the pharmaceutical co&amp;hyphen;payment. One of the things that we need to be looking at in the area of pharmaceuticals—and I give credit to the previous government for this; and we will certainly be continuing it—is education, not only of medical providers but also of the community; to constantly have people saying, `Do I need a drug at all, is there a non&amp;hyphen;drug alternative available to me, what are the benefits of taking this drug and what are the potential side effects of taking it?'

        One of the advantages which may come from the Council of Australian Government's program, again initiated by the previous government, is that we might find, once we have gone through this process and we have trialled the coordinated care trials with family doctors, that prescribers will have better access, particularly for lower income people, to non&amp;hyphen;drug treatments. It may be easier to get physiotherapy, counselling or whatever may be required as a more appropriate treatment than a drug for a problem a person has.

        We also need to change perceptions and expectations. People need to understand that good medicine does not mean giving an

We need to put some resources aside into changing community expectations. We have changed them in relation to smoking and, thankfully, the attitudes of people in relation to HIV&amp;hyphen;AIDS and other serious conditions. If we can change expectations through education we will do a lot to reduce the rate of growth of outlays in pharmaceuticals and, hopefully, avoid some of the negative consequences of taking medication.

        One of the other important initiatives with which the government is proceeding is providing feedback to doctors about their prescribing habits. If you take a group of prescribers in a particular area and give them simple, factual information as to how many non&amp;hyphen;steroidal anti&amp;hyphen;inflammatories, how many antibiotics or how many anti&amp;hyphen;hypertensives they prescribe and if a doctor discovers that he or she is the No. 1 provider of drugs in that area, there is no question in my mind that that will have a positive impact on the person's prescribing behaviour. The more information we can give to prescribers the better.

        One of the things we ought to consider as a government is using divisions of general practice, again another very good and positive initiative of the previous government, and provide funding for those divisions to employ a pharmacist who can then work with general practitioners, meeting on a regular fortnightly or monthly basis, to review drug prescribing behaviour and patterns in nursing homes and residential aged care institutions. Then we can extend into the community the setting of the

        The other challenge which needs to be pursued, certainly by the medical and pharmaceutical professions—with the support of the government—is prescribing guidelines. I refer honourable members, again in particular the member for Dobell, to the 16 September edition of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Medical Journal of Australia
        </emphasis>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        People ought not to be too frightened of prescribing guidelines. They are extremely useful in a wide variety of clinical situations, and they should be seen as genuine attempts by independent experts and peers to give guidance to professionals who are striving to do their best for their patients, but there are areas of therapeutics and aspects of the use of certain drugs, particularly new drugs, which individuals could be expected, not always, to carry at his or her fingertips.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other dimension which hopefully will have a positive impact on prescribing patterns in Australia is the progressive computerisation of medical practice, which still remains distressingly slow but is starting to gain some momentum. If we had computerised prescribing, it obviously would be possible to eliminate transcription errors and to warn a prescriber very quickly of prospective drug interaction. Research from the Canadian PharmaNet system would suggest that it has been particularly effective over there.

        It could also link prescribing guidelines and drug information to computerised prescribing.

         I appreciate—the nature of politics being what it is—that the opposition will oppose this. Understandably, they will reflect some of the attitudes and concerns of those in the community who, understandably, do not like having to pay any more at all for anything, in particular for pharmaceuticals. But our responsibility as leaders—as we ought to be—is to remind the community that if we want to continue to have access to high quality medi cations, and if we want to continue to be able to respond in a positive manner to issues like listing beta interferon for multiple sclerosis or listing pulmozyme for cystic fibrosis, we need to do whatever is reasonably possible to see that every Australian—whether they be a pensioner or an income earner—makes a contribution, proportionate to the cost of that benefit that they derive, which helps us maintain the sustainability of the system.

        I do not have the figures in front of me—please excuse me if I am wrong when I say this—but since about 1992 the contribution by concessional cardholders to the cost of pharmaceuticals has increased by about 0.9 per cent. In the same period of time, the cost of those drugs to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has jumped by about 34 per cent. So this government, as I think the previous government did, is bending over backwards to see that the people who most need it still receive the vast majority of support and subsidy that they should receive.

         —I might have cause to agree with some of what the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) had to say, except that, overall, we did not see any increase in funding in health care; we saw a very significant reduction. There was a cut of over $2 billion to health care, most of which was used to offset the introduction of a private health insurance rebate, which will have very little impact indeed on the quality or the amount of health care available to Australian citizens.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to address this National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill in the context of those cuts because it is in that context that they assume their importance. Of course governments will make adjustments from time to time in the contribution that individuals make to their health care, aged care or education—whatever it may be—but
        <break page="6026" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         they usually do so in the context of improving services and expanding the range and quality of what is available to citizens.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This budget, in my recent experience, is unique in that it does not do that. All of the cuts that we have seen to the health budget are basically designed to offset the very great expense of a single measure which I think most people—particularly health economists who have examined it—conclude will have almost no impact on the quality, let alone the extent, of services available in the health care system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the principles that is in danger of being undermined in the current debate about health care and, indeed, by the approach that the government is taking in its budget and other measures bill is the principle of universal provision and universal access. It is the idea that we all subscribe to a quality health care system and pay according to our means so that those people who are not very well off pay little or nothing by way of contribution—whether through the general tax system or the Medicare levy—but they may at other times in their life, and this is typical, make a payment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a view that people of low means stay that way forever. It might seem like that to some people at the moment, but it is certainly not true for the most part. People come and go from the work force. When they retire they have a lesser means, but during their lifetime they will have made a very substantial contribution not only via the work and effort that they have put in—whether it was well remunerated or not—but also through the tax system. So the principle of paying according to your means is a very important one.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Beside that is the principle of making sure that the system is embraced by all in society. In the area of health care, there has always been the view—I have heard it expressed by members of government, and it has been directed at me by way of criticism—that if you can afford it you should have private health insurance; you should look after yourself. That is a very serious misunderstanding of what I think is the contract between the government and the citizens in the areas of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         health care, education, transport and environmental protection, where the purchase of a collective good is much more important than the exercise of a single, individual choice.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So if I stay in the health care system or the education system as a relatively high income earner—indeed, by community standards, a high income earner—and I pay more tax in order to do that, it is benefiting in two ways those people in the community who do not have very much. Firstly, my tax is going to that purpose. I will not be pushing to have my tax dollar removed and given to some other purpose, like a private health insurance rebate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second is that members of the community, if they see that the well-heeled and well-off are absenting themselves from what is considered to be the universal provision because they believe that there is something better somewhere else—whether it is a private school or private hospital—will, of course, lose confidence in the system. So I have a very strong commitment to the idea of, firstly, collective purchase—that we can jointly purchase better services for everybody—and, secondly, a contribution according to our means.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my health care—in the education of my son, in other areas of my life—I have remained strongly committed to, and have personally acted upon it when I was not so wealthy, the view that the universal system had a lot to offer me. Now that I am better off as a member of parliament, I want to make a contribution to that, rather than say, as John Kenneth Galbraith has said in the United States, `If it is not going to benefit me, I don't want to contribute'—the culture of contentment, if you like.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is very obvious in the United States that you have this two&amp;hyphen;tiered system that says, `If I have private provision'—whatever it may be—`then I don't want other people using my taxes for quality hospital care or education' or whatever it may be.

         of improved quality or access.

        Indeed, at the state level, because there were very significant cuts, particularly in Victoria, in my home state of Western Australia and in South Australia, what the hospitals did, in a sense quite sensibly, to ensure their survival was to cost shift to the Commonwealth. I railed against that as a minister because it clearly is not desirable to have this dollar movement between the two levels of government without any improvement in the quality of care. But I understood why the hospitals were doing it. It was because the state governments were cutting off their funds.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In Victoria, they were explicitly encouraged wherever they could to, for instance, purchase pharmaceuticals via an outside system that would enable them to access the pharmaceutical benefits system rather than having to pay for the drugs in&amp;hyphen;house. It was a similar case with clinicians, physiotherapy and the like. All of it was being pushed out of the hospital campuses because they were not getting enough dollars from state governments.

        The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) now tells us that that cost shifting, which he estimates as being worth nearly $313 million, since that is what he is taking out of the budget over four years, will be remedied by simply taking the money from the hospitals. All that will do is ensure that the hospitals have no capacity to continue to deliver quality of service to the range of services that has previously been the case. That $313 million that is taken out of hospitals will produce these effects—longer waiting lists in the case of elective surgery, a very serious threat to the quality of care in the case of emergency and other medical requirements in the hospital, and it will also mean that individuals pay more, because a lot of the services which the hospitals have just managed to continue to provide—physiotherapy,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        For some people, about 30&amp;hyphen;plus per cent of the population, their private health insurance will help to cover them for that. But for the majority, it will not.

I will return to that in a moment.

        The cost shifting reduction undertaken by the government will have an impact on hospital care. I had the pleasure recently of visiting the base hospital in Geelong. They made it very clear to me, `We have done everything we can. We have broken down the demarcation problems that we faced in the hospital between people who did the cooking and the cleaning and people who provided orderly services. We are all capable now of doing anything that is required of us.' The hospital's work force has been very substantially reduced. The costs of operation have been very significantly cut under the Victorian government's removal of $270 million from that system. But they said, `We cannot cut any further without having a very major impact on the quality of the care that we deliver.' They said it was spread so thin that some of it was skeletal.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On top of the cuts for so&amp;hyphen;called cost shifting problems—they are real, but this is not the solution to them; it is to get agreements with the states—there are cuts, of course, to states grants under the FAG system of $450 million. So the cumulative impact of those two sets of cuts is to remove $800 million from the public hospital system over four years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is already leading to substantial further cuts by the states. They are not going to make up the difference. They do not have a capacity to do so. In some cases they do not have the will to do so, because part of their agenda—particularly the conservative governments—is to move as many people as they can out of the public system and into the private system, because they do not pay for that. Private health insurance does, the government does now, with this huge rebate,
        <break page="6028" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and Medicare does to a certain extent when it comes to the medical services. So that is undermining that very important principle that I outlined earlier—a quality public system; not denying the right to choice in the private system, but not having that as an alternative, as a substitute, for decent universal provision.

        There has been discussion today—I will not dwell on it—of the very significant cuts to the dental program. This is a program that was targeted to low income earners. It has never been a universal provision, but it did assist those low income earners and health care cardholders to get decent dental care in a timely fashion. We have seen $400 million cut from that program, with the inevitable result that there will be longer waiting times, fewer procedures will be able to be undertaken and access will be reduced.

        A lot of the dental clinics that have been funded by the joint application of Commonwealth and state funds will be closed. They simply will not be able to maintain the operation of those clinics. So it is not just that people will have to wait longer, but the clinic in their area may not be available at all. The local private dentist who was providing some of the services under the Commonwealth dental program will also not be available.

         The point of the observations I am making is that you have these very substantial cuts, over $2 billion, while simultaneously having the introduction of a private health insurance rebate. The government was warned before the election by health economists and others that this would simply be money that would purchase no additional service and it would inevitably result in the increased cost either of health insurance premiums or of some of the co&amp;hyphen;payments required by doctors and, in some cases, hospitals. If you put that much extra money into the system with no caps, with no restriction on what either the health insurance funds can charge for their premiums or the hospitals and doctors can charge for the private services that they provide, there will inevitably be an escalation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Any first year high school economist, let alone university economist, will tell you that. Indeed, a lot of work was done on this; it is not as though it came out of nowhere and no&amp;hyphen;one understood what the effects would be. So all of us, whether we have private health insurance or not, are contributing to something that is enjoyed by a minority—some 35 per cent to 40 per cent depending on the state; $1.7 billion is taken out of the public system provided by the 70&amp;hyphen;odd per cent who have no other form of cover and provided to the 30 per cent who have private health insurance. And in such a way, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) discovered, that you have no control over the cost. So there is an immediate escalation in the price of private health insurance, driven in part by the expectation of higher costs from doctors and hospitals. The Prime Minister panics because he realises there is nothing he can do about that and says, `In future, these increases will have to be the subject of prime ministerial and Treasury consideration, along with the health minister.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This all happened when the health minister was away. I am sure had he been here it would never have occurred because he knows—and the Prime Minister has now figured it out too—that the last thing you want is political interference on an ad hoc basis on the price charged for private health insurance premiums as there are statutory
         <break page="6029" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          requirements for those funds to hold certain reserves and their payments are based on the costs to them of paying the doctors and hospitals who are making claims. So it is not the private health insurance funds who are driving this, it is the hospitals and doctors in the private system.

         The farce of the involvement of the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been revealed. By having said they wanted to control these private health insurance costs, they have now had to agree that they have no control over them whatever. The only way you can control these matters is by having some form of legislation in place to effectively change the way that that $1.7 billion is applied rather than having it simply slip into the system apparently unnoticed but with huge costs.

         The benefit to the consumer of this rebate has disappeared already. We are only six months in and it has not even been applied. Before they get the benefit of the rebate the health insurance costs will have risen to totally absorb the costs of the rebate. This is a political decision, and the Productivity Commission is not the body to examine private health insurance. I doubt that they have the skills and, judging from some of their former considerations, certainly not the right attitude either.

         I want to talk too about the pharmaceutical benefits because they are an insult added to injury, particularly the co&amp;hyphen;payments for pensioners. In the past, whenever co&amp;hyphen;payments were increased, we were very clear that there had to be a corresponding increase in the pension; they could not be absorbed by people on such low incomes and it was important to be fair and reasonable about this. These people have so little disposable income that, with the best will in the world, if you simply increase the co&amp;hyphen;payment without any corresponding change in their pension, even if they are only part&amp;hyphen;pensioners, then you significantly handicap their ability to purchase other services and goods that they need just to survive from day to day. Even with the safety net provisions, a considerable hardship will be placed on those older people, those on concessions who are not necessarily the ones

         The general increase has many of the same characteristics. It hits the people least able to afford it because it is effectively a flat tax. It effectively hits everybody in the same way regardless of their means. That is bad enough. But along with that change, which is very significant—you are talking about $323 million being saved by the co&amp;hyphen;payment for pensioners, the general increase contributing $179 million—is this mean little measure of the rounding provisions. I could not believe my ears when this came through in the bill. I quote the minister's second reading speech because it is entertaining to say the least.

         Listening to the member for Bradfield about why we have such overprescription and the importance of education, I agree with him about the remedies. We need to educate doctors, pharmacists and the general community about the dangers of inappropriate and excessive prescribing. But I always choke on the observation that you blame the patient first; that it is these dreadful patients who come up to you and say, `Doctor, I want a prescription for my viral illness'—a cold or whatever it happens to be—`and if you don't give it to me, I'll go to another doctor' and the doctor says, `Yes, Sir' or `Madam' as if they had no clinical judgment at all.

         To say that doctors are really the victims of the patients when it comes to overprescribing is to severely undermine the medical profession because it shows them as incapable of making sound judgments in the interests of the patients and, frankly, I do not believe it. It is just a way of shifting the blame because a lot of doctors are not as careful as they might be about prescribing—not because the patients are these horrible dragons who otherwise would take away their livelihood. The other changes that have occurred in the past in improving medical education, particularly about pharmaceuticals, need to be continued and expanded.

         Just a couple of other elements, given the context of this change, that deserve some attention from the community at large. Firstly, the changes to the medical work force: there will be an opportunity to debate this further but the minister has been all over the shop on this; he does not really know where he wants to go. First of all, he wants to cut the access of medical students to provider numbers. When there is a huge outcry about that he says, `Hang on, we'll do that but not many of you will be affected because we'll cut off medical migration.'

         I am very committed to the idea of reducing the number of people who migrate to Australia and then expect to practise medicine here.

         Today the minister would appear to be saying that at the same time he is going to allow temporary resident doctors—I will have to check this—to sit the medical exams and add to the number of overseas trained doctors in the community.

         The pharmaceutical benefits scheme has been in this country for about 40 years. It is designed to provide access to pharmaceuticals for Australians, regardless of their circumstances, at a reasonable cost. This scheme has been supported by successive governments. Over the years since the scheme was introduced, the rise in co&amp;hyphen;payments, on average, has been only one per cent per annum. But the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as with other areas of medical expenditure, continues to skyrocket. Estimates for the 1995-96 year show that the cost of the scheme in that year alone will rise by about 16.5 per cent.

Also, many concessional patients do not need 52 scripts a year, which means any additional costs to them will be less than the $26 annual co&amp;hyphen;payment increase.

         One of the problems that we have is that the costs of this scheme continue to skyrocket and spiral. I mentioned earlier in my speech that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will cost some 16.5 per cent more in 1995-96. Indeed, it is interesting to note that PBS outlays now total about $2.7 billion and that these will rise 50 per cent in cost over the next four years without the pressure of any new drugs being listed. So clearly what government must do is seek to limit overuse of the scheme and, indeed, ensure that the co-payment covers the greater part of the cost of providing these pharmaceuticals to Australians.

          It should be noted that amongst the submissions received by the House of Representatives standing committee is a submission which recommended, favourably, the PharmaNet trial which has taken place in British Columbia. This is a very interesting trial because it is really a win, win, win situation for the community. Pharmacists are linked with the system and, when patients go to pharmacies to have their prescriptions filled, the identification of the client is checked against the clinical conditions of the client and prior drug prescriptions. It is possible for the pharmacist to decline to supply a drug to someone who might have had too many drugs in the past, to someone who has just had that drug prescribe or to someone who might well have an adverse reaction to that drug.

         <para first-indent="16">
          As a result of this trial in British Columbia they have been able to reduce the overprescription of drugs. There is, of course, an incentive for pharmacists to do the right thing. In the event of a pharmacist determining that a prescription ought not to be filled for certain reasons, provided those reasons are valid, then the pharmacist still gets paid a dispensing fee.

As a nation and as a government our financial situation is somewhat critical.

          On 2 March we inherited a budget deficit of $10.3 billion. An enormous amount of money was absent from the Treasury despite the fact that, in the run&amp;hyphen;up to the election campaign, the then Minister for Finance—the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)—and the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who is now retired, told us that the budget was in surplus. They said that they were not able to tell us exactly what the situation was because the numbers had not been done, but that the budget was in surplus.

Other Australians will pay $20. But in both cases there will be safety nets. So the underprivileged and those who are needy will still receive the treatment that they deserve.

The truth is that those opposite are jealous of the health record of the former Labor government. They hate Medicare. They hate its success. They hate its universality. What they really hate most is the fact that the Australian people love it so much that it has

        When I come into this place to speak on legislation it is necessary again and again to express my disappointment at the fact that this government has broken yet another election promise. The National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996 certainly represents another broken promise. As the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) pointed out earlier, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in his so&amp;hyphen;called Headland speech to the Australian Council of Social Service in October last year, promised the audience:

        Let's be clear about it: this bill reduces the value of pensions, and it comes on top of a number of attacks on older Australians contained within the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I list amongst those attacks the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program, which was the topic of the MPI earlier today—a most callous attack on older Australians in particular. I list the $6.80 per week now being imposed on something like 200,000 pensioners who rely on the home and community care program to remain in their homes, and who, by doing so, save the government money. I list changes to the deeming provisions which will make the first $2,000 of pensioner savings assessable under the income test. And, of course, I list the decision to withhold the 1 November Medicare fee increases, which will surely put pressure on some general practitioners to cease bulk&amp;hyphen;billing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Most importantly, I list the decision by this government to impose an entry fee for nursing homes on older Australians. I am getting a little bit tired of hearing members on the government side telling us that the nursing home entry fee is merely a logical extension of the fee imposed by the former Labor government on hostels. That is a load of rubbish. The move to a hostel is a lifestyle choice, one which can be planned well in advance. But when it comes time to enter a nursing home, usually there is no choice and no time to plan finances in advance.

         Now we have this pharmaceutical benefits scheme slug. The bill increases the cost of prescriptions for pensioners from $2.70 to $3.20, a 50c or 18 per cent increase. It is an increase which, for the first time, breaks the nexus between the imposition of a prescription charge for concession card holders and the compensatory rise in the pension.

         I heard the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) talking earlier about a pensioner couple he bumped into while campaigning in the seat of Lindsay. He told us that the pensioner couple assured him that they did not mind paying a little bit more for their pharmaceuticals or contributing a little more to the cost of their health service, as long as it was for the good of the country. The member for Bradfield is talking to a much different breed of pensioner than the ones I regularly talk to in my electorate. The pensioners I talk to in my electorate are outraged by this arbitrary rise in the prescription fee, and so they should be.

         I painstakingly went through the speeches of honourable members on the other side made during the debate on the bill which introduced the prescription fee for pensioners in 1990. I did so with the view of throwing back at present government members some of the statements they might have made in opposition to the bill at that time. But, alas, bar the words of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), I could not find anything from members on the other side that showed they were prepared to get up and attack the government of the day for the imposition of this prescription charge. Why should I be surprised? It is obvious now that they believed at the time that the measure did not go far enough.

         I found that many of them spent most of their time defending the chemists—who, at the time, had formed quite a close allegiance with the Liberal Party and were doing quite a bit of campaigning during the 1990 election. But let me return to what the lonely member for O'Connor had to say in 1990 with respect to the introduction of the co&amp;hyphen;payment for concession card holders:

         Yet, the former government's Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill compensated pensioners 100 per cent—a $2.50 charge, a $2.50 rise in the rate of pension.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The 1990 decision by the former Labor government was a very brave one, but it was a justifiable decision, designed not to slug pensioners but to discourage the accumulation of drugs in bathroom cupboards and to address the forever rising cost of both new and existing drugs. It was a decision designed to address the ever&amp;hyphen;burgeoning cost of the PBS, now costing the nation, as the member for Fisher has pointed out, some $2.7 billion each year. But it was designed to do so without whacking those least able to pay. It was a clever decision, one which addressed the problem while maintaining the scheme's most basic aim: affordability of pharmaceuticals for all; access to pharmaceuticals for all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why has the government chosen for the first time to break this nexus between the co&amp;hyphen;payment and the compensatory rise in the pension? It is because it means some $308 million to the government's coffers over four years. That means $308 million out of the pockets of concession card holders. There is no other way of looking at it. It is simple arithmetic. How can you say that the government will raise an extra $308 million over four years yet concession card holders will be no worse off?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Families will also be hit as a result of this bill. The cost of a prescription for working families will now be $20, an increase of $2.60 or 15 per cent. It is another arbitrary increase which will raise some $180 million over four years. That is $180 million out of the pockets of working families.

         When you add the $56 million which will be raised by changing the rounding rules, the total slug of this bill is some $544 million over four years.

An additional $2.60 per script. This will be small change to some

         This impost on Australian families comes on top of a number of budget initiatives which will hit those same families. There are higher child care costs, higher costs to families sending their children to university and a range of social security benefit tightening measures contained within the budget. As I mentioned when speaking on the impact on older Australians, the decision to withhold the Medicare fee increases is likely to deny them the opportunity to be bulk&amp;hyphen;billed by general practitioners.

         This is an issue which will have its greatest impact on rural and regional Australia where there exists a shortage of general practitioners.

         The opposition opposes the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996. This bill is very aptly named, I suggest. The inclusion of the words `budget measures' is most appropriate because the bill epitomises the budget strategy. It epitomises its heartlessness. It epitomises the total lack of understanding on the part of its architects of the fact that it is sustainable economic growth which will take the government's budget back to surplus. More clearly, it reflects the government's determination to impose the bulk of the pain of its deficit reduction program on those with the least ability to sustain the attack, that being the older in our community and low income working class families.

        <para first-indent="16">
         While the government's word counts for very little following the enormous list of broken promises and commitments in its short term of office, I call upon it to guarantee that there will be no further increases in the co-payment either for concession cardholders or non-concession cardholders for the life of this parliament. I think that is a reasonable request. I think it will put some confidence back into the system. I think it is fair and reasonable that pensioners, the older members of our community, the members of our community that have contributed so much, should have an expectation that the charge should not rise any further.

Indeed, I believe this bill is typical of so much of the change that this government has attempted to sneak in through the back door because it knows, as we on this side of the House know, and as the community are now discovering, these measures are penny pinching at its meanest and most devastating. In particular, I join my colleagues in opposing the increases to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme co&amp;hyphen;payments. This bill under discussion raises a concessional co-payment for medication under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for health care cardholders from $2.70 to $3.20 and for general patients from $17.40 to $20.

I spent some time in the Lindsay area in the lead-up to the by-election and certainly no pensioners said that to me. All I can say is that the pensioners the honourable member for Bradfield met when he was campaigning on the streets of Penrith were very different from the pensioners I met and most certainly were very different from the pensioners at Oak Flats, Port Kembla, Dapto, Warilla and Albion Park in my electorate.

        In June this year, a local community health group in my electorate held a public meeting which a member of my staff attended—I was actually here in Canberra. The meeting was called to gather views from the public about the impact the operation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme had on individuals and families. The group was particularly interested to hear from pensioners and low income families. The meeting was very well attended and many issues were raised by the people present which were forwarded to the National Health Consumer Forum.

        Let me tell you one story raised at that meeting. This story was related by a mother with three asthmatic children who graphically detailed for the group the daily struggle faced by her family in meeting their health care costs. Unlike the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), in Throsby we do not need to invent families to make our point. We do not have to have a Mr and Mrs Wright. We have the families there.

They are not, however, eligible for disability support for this child.

        This particular mother painted a clear picture of day-to-day life for her family in trying to provide the medication needed for her children. The woman knows what `shares' mean. To her it means her children regularly having to share inhalers until they can get enough money to buy another one. The family also struggles to provide swimming sessions for the children in an attempt to prevent serious occurrences of asthma. They must always have double medication for the two oldest children because one inhaler must be

        It is often these additional costs that are not part of the standard calculation of health care costs that create added burdens for families and individuals with chronic illnesses. The costs of other treatments such as medical tests, aids and appliances, nutritional supplements, and preventive treatment all add to the stress on their budget. And probably most pitifully, this mother told, in some embarrassment, of the birthday presents for the children she had requested from the grandparents this year. The birthday presents were dust mite covers for their beds. It is quite clear from this example that families in these circumstances are already being denied the maximum opportunity to deal in the most effective and efficient manner with chronic illnesses.

        This family's circumstances are not unusual. This is a real dilemma facing families on low incomes every day of every week for the whole year. An extra $2.60 for each medication for them is a significant problem. When you recognise that usually they are purchasing three or more scripts at a time, the amount of money is compounded. If more than one family member is affected by the illness, then stretching the budget can become an impossible task.

        Other families at the meeting told of having to make decisions, when given scripts by doctors, whether or not to have them filled.

And this in the lucky country!

The same document makes the same spurious claim in its explanation about the increased co-payment for general patients. It states that an intended impact is to create a `disincentive arising from the increased cost for the acquisition of unnecessary scripts'.

        Regularly I speak to the people in the Throsby electorate on these issues and regularly I am horrified by the decisions that families are being forced to make on their health. Often I am told that people delay going to doctors for unreasonable amounts of time because co-payments are a problem. People tell me about hunting around the house, in kids' money boxes and so forth, to find enough money to buy the medicines prescribed. Often when families are sick, such as during flu outbreaks, the parents will buy their children's medications and not their own.

        The results of these sorts of decisions have far-reaching impacts on the education performance of children, on the work productiveness of parents, on the spread of illness and, not least, on the quality of life for these families. Indeed, the $488 million estimated to be saved by these measures will be more than lost in the impacts outlined. This is a measure that takes the easy, visible saving and ignores the far more significant and insidious cost to our society and economy in the long run.

I can well believe that this would be incomprehensible to the share-endowed people on the government benches. I can well believe that the idea of having to scrape together small change to buy medicines would be incomprehensible to them. I can also well believe that making decisions about buying, sharing or doing without medicines is incomprehensible for them. They are, after all, seriously preoccupied with determining the best time to sell hundreds of thousands of dollars of shares. I can well believe all of this. It makes the petty, mean-minded and arrogant decisions of this bill all the more shameful for this government.

        We need to remember the speech the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave to ACOSS last year when he promised that the coalition would maintain the real value of pensions and other social security benefits. This bill breaks that promise. This bill proposes to increase the co&amp;hyphen;payment for all health care cardholders from $2.70 to $3.20 per prescription. It is important to note that it is the first time since 1990&amp;hyphen;91 that co-payments have been increased by more than the CPI adjustment. This represents an increase in 1995-96 of 18.5 per cent for concession cardholders. At the same time, it raises the safety net from $140 to $166 so that all cardholders will be forced to spend $26 more before they are offered the protection of the safety net.

        Like the previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), I too have had a number of meetings with pensioners. I have had a meeting at the northern end of my electorate at Judge Book Retirement Village in Eltham and at the West Heidelberg Community Health Centre. One of the major concerns raised at those meetings is the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals. Those elderly people are well aware that their lives are going to be made much worse by this increase in the price of pharmaceuticals.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is the case that both concessional and general patients will be adversely affected by changes designed to round up rather than round down this co&amp;hyphen;payment. Those of us who have had a close look at the budget can see that these measures effectively increase the co-payment by $56 million. That is how much the government expects to raise by rounding up rather than rounding down the price. This is a sneaky way of going about the fee increases.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The rationale for this measure is said to be that it will provide an incentive for patients to reduce unnecessary drug use. What I would like to know is: on what basis does the government make this claim? How can it know that pensioners and others are reducing only unnecessary medication? Is it not more reasonable to suppose that they will reduce their purchases of pharmaceuticals and that they find it very difficult to judge what are essential and what are non&amp;hyphen;essential pharmaceuticals? It will mean a direct attack on the health standards of vulnerable Australians.

        A particularly worrying aspect of this proposal—and one of the main reasons we oppose this increase—is that it fails to increase the pharmaceutical allowance which has been paid by the Department of Social Security to pensioners and some other beneficiaries to offset the cost of pharmaceuticals. In the past, increases in this co&amp;hyphen;payment have always been accompanied by increases in the pharmaceutical allowance. This change, which is not accompanied by an increase in the pharmaceutical allowance, will have damaging

        Along with other people holding concession cards, they are also faced with significant costs for dental treatment following the government's decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental care program. We saw today the government's intransigence on this issue during the debate on the matter of public importance when the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) said that free dental care is an indulgence. I do not think there is one pensioner in my electorate who thinks that free dental care is anything other than a necessity because otherwise they will be paying up to $180 just for a filling, which is absolutely outside the capacity of all pensioners. This government might think that free dental care and subsidised prescriptions are indulgences but what the community knows is that they are a necessity.

        The adverse impact of these changes is not just restricted to people holding concession cards. Families will also suffer. Everyone who is not a concession cardholder will pay $20 for each prescription, an increase of $2.60 or—and let us look at the percentage again—14.9 per cent, a heck of a lot higher than the consumer price index. This means that any additional funds received by families through the government's tax package which survived
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the child&amp;hyphen;care increase and the increased HECS payments will be swallowed up by this increased co&amp;hyphen;payment for pharmaceuticals. It certainly makes an absolute mockery of the government's commitment to families.

        Let us look at what happens to a family with two children when they go to the doctor. We all know that when children get sick they tend to get sick at the same time.

The family tax initiative for this family is only $7.70 a fortnight for each dependent child. One&amp;hyphen;third of this is gone just from the increase in the price of essential medicines.

        From this measure alone we are seeing the eating away of this family tax initiative, not to mention all the other cost increases to families that are contained in this budget.

Some chronically ill people and low income families (especially those with . . . children) who do not have concessional status find it very difficult to meet out of pocket expenses before reaching the safety net threshold.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rationale for this measure, as I said before, is said to be that it will decrease the number of scripts that people buy—the government's estimate is by two per cent in the first year. There is no attempt to differentiate between necessary and unnecessary scripts. Perhaps the government believes that only those who hold concession cards use unnecessary prescriptions because, as far as those who don't hold concession cards are concerned, it will only decrease the script volumes overall.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The budget provisions suggest that the decrease in the use of pharmaceuticals will not be sustained beyond 1998&amp;hyphen;99. That leads me to think that the government believes the additional co&amp;hyphen;payment, while increasing costs
        <break page="6042" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         to consumers, will have no impact on overall demand for pharmaceuticals in the longer term. Does it mean, as I would suspect the government is thinking, that it might have to put up the price again in that time? Or, as suggested by some other commentators such as Professor Stephen Leeder, is what we are seeing that co&amp;hyphen;payments have now risen to the point where they exceed in some cases the across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;counter price of the same product in the United States? This is how silly it has got: we are now charging co&amp;hyphen;payments for drugs in Australia that are above the across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;counter price in other countries.

        Any realistic attempt to control pharmaceutical expenditure must look at both supply and demand, especially at the supply of high cost drugs which have increasingly come within the ambit of the scheme. What these budget measures do is look only at demand. They are thus, in my view, doomed to fail in the overall objective of trying to bring control to the overall cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. These measures are unfair.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is true that we intend to support the budget measure designed to deny access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme subsidies to visitors to Australia from countries which do not have reciprocal health care arrangements. I have to say it is similar to a proposal made by the former government in 1991, but that proposal was withdrawn after opposition from the Privacy Commissioner, the Pharmacy Guild and other consumer bodies. Their opposition was based on the threat to privacy of individual patients resulting from the proposal to link pharmacists by computer to the Health Insurance Commission so that they could verify eligibility of people seeking prescriptions through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not clear from the budget how the government intends to deal with this issue. While we note that the government has said it will hold discussions with the Pharmacy Guild, what we would like to see is satisfactory arrangements made to safeguard patient privacy—and only in those circumstances can the government rely on our support for this measure.

         I reiterate once again that we are strongly opposed to the other measures in this bill because they are unfair, because they are yet more broken promises of this government and because what these measures show is that the government does not understand that access to necessary health services is a key responsibility of government. We see in the decision to abolish the dental program and in the way the government has completely changed the philosophy about access to nursing homes, by increasing fees and requiring up&amp;hyphen;front fees before you get into a nursing home, that the whole notion of access to essential health services on the basis of need is out the window. These decisions are wrong and we will oppose them because necessary health care is something we as Australians should be proud to provide for each other as a community.

        As with all these budget related measures, it is easy to pick the winners and losers under the Howard government. The big losers in this case are families and concession cardholders. The changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme attack some of the most disadvantaged in the community. An increase in the maximum patient contribution for general patients from $17.40 to a maximum of $20 means that ordinary families will suffer every time they have to go to the pharmacy. Those with small children will be aware that hardly a week goes by without visits to the doctor and the pharmacy and the expense that can result from these. The government's proposals for an increase in the co-payment slug these families even further.

        The co-payment increase really makes a complete mockery of the government's rhetoric about the family tax initiative.

        The most insidious aspect of the increase of the co-payment is its effect on pensioners and other concession cardholders. Pensioners will be required to pay an extra 50c per prescription. This represents a clear breach of the coalition's promise both before and since the election. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised that the real value of all pension benefits and other entitlements for low income earners would be maintained. Yet the increase from $2.70 to $3.20 in the co-payment for pensioners is not offset by any corresponding increase in the pension. The real value is not maintained.

        For the first time since the co-payment was introduced for pensioners and concession cardholders, the important link between the pension and the PBS co-payment is broken. Furthermore, the Prime Minister promised that one group in the community that is not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable. How else, other than hurting the most vulnerable, is one to describe taking an extra $100 million per year from health cardholders? It is a direct assault on them. The budget changes to the PBS co-payment are combined with other attacks on the vulnerable in the health portfolio.

        The pharmaceutical benefits scheme not only protects the most disadvantaged in our society but also allows access to medicines for all Australians.

That function is simply too vital to be sacrificed at the altar of transfer of responsibilities to the states.

For that investment in the pharmaceutical industry, companies have committed $1.9 billion in export added value, $1.9 billion in domestic added value, $538 million in R&amp;D expenditure and about $604 million in investment expenditure. In fact, in commenting on the Industry Commission report, the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said:

        </para>
        <para>
         Despite these figures that indicate the success of the factor F scheme, the Industry Commission seems oblivious to this same success. These figures are the best examples possible for the case for continuing intervention. I urge the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to consider the scheme's success, as the factor F scheme is scheduled to expire in the middle of 1999.

         There are other inconsistencies in the Industry Commission's report. It states that the low prices are an impediment to industry growth, yet the factor F scheme is designed to specifically deal with this. The report complains that constantly increasing health costs are a problem for the Commonwealth, yet advocates higher prices for drugs, which would presumably eat up more of the health budget. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme did not escape the attention of the National Commission of Audit. The report recommends that—and I quote:

         This is precisely what was supposed to happen and does occur as a result of co&amp;hyphen;payments. A study conducted in 1991 investigating the relationship between the use and price of drugs showed that the increase in the co&amp;hyphen;payment from $5 to $10 in 1987 reduced demand by 27 per cent for general patients. The Department of Health and Family Services states in the

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But at some point the increase in the co&amp;hyphen;payment could be expected to go beyond simply eliminating unnecessary drug use. There is a danger that increases in co&amp;hyphen;payments will drive demand down below the appropriate level of prescriptions and dispensations. People often make the decision to fill their prescriptions based on the capacity to pay, not just on whether they require the medicine. Despite the safety net provisions, we have to understand that in a family's weekly or fortnightly budget these are considerations that have to be made.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The upshot of this scenario is that there is a possibility that necessary prescriptions will not be filled;  that once they are prescribed by the doctor, a person would not go to the chemist to have them dispensed because of continually increasing co&amp;hyphen;payments.

         The National Commission of Audit report criticises the open&amp;hyphen;ended nature of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as opposed to capping of services in other health areas. What would it suggest as a viable alternative? Limiting the number of times people are allowed to go to the pharmacy? The tone of the whole section of the National Commission of Audit report on health services suggests that the report's authors think people go to the doctor or get medicine as a leisure activity and should pay for it accordingly. It fails to realise that people need health services because they are ill, not because they want them. The report talks of `using price to ration access to health care', as if people choose when they get sick.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The most worrying sign from the National Commission of Audit report is that one of its alternative approaches for reform is to fully devolve all health funding to the states, including the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This insidious recommendation must be vigorously opposed. Both the Industry Commission report and the National Commission of Audit report are more concerned with an ideology and attempting to implement that ideology than with the issues of people's health.

          What must be realised is that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a scheme that requires the efforts of a number of people. It requires the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry. Talking about the pharmaceutical industry, I have to emphasise the need for a domestic Australian pharmaceutical industry. Some of the things that have been developed within medical research and development have been by renowned Australian scientists and medical specialists. A number of those developments have been lost to Australia because of our inability to develop them. As the figures that I cited earlier in my speech indicated, a report by a predecessor to the Industry Commission about the pharmaceutical industry meant that the previous government put in place the factor F scheme. It is a scheme which has been very successful because it links the pharmaceutical industry with the PBS. The PBS is a cooperative effort between medical professionals, doctors, pharmacy professionals and, importantly, the consumer, the patient.

          The decision by the previous government to increase co&amp;hyphen;payments for general payments and introduce them for pensioners and health care cardholders was to provide an important price signal. But that price signal was not just for the consumer's benefit. The price signal was also to give added weight to the professional judgment that was to be made—predominantly by the prescriber—when dealing with a patient. Because the co&amp;hyphen;payment was giving a price signal, alternative courses of treatment were able to be suggested.

He led with all the shibboleths about the black hole which the government inherited and all those sorts of things. But I have to say in fairness to him that later, when he spoke more as a medical professional, he acknowledged the efforts of the previous government in trying to deal with some of the issues of over&amp;hyphen;prescribing and over&amp;hyphen;dispensing of the PBS.

           Whilst I have emphasised the importance of the price signal, that was not the only measure to rationalise the use of prescription drugs.

         —I am very disappointed that there are so few speakers from the government side on this vital legislation. There could be no more socially important legislation than that which deals with the provision of pharmaceuticals to people in need, the contribution made by a patient towards the cost of those pharmaceuticals and overall health care and the other range of matters covered in the debate on this bill thus far. In stark contrast to all the tub&amp;hyphen;thumpers amongst the new members opposite, here tonight on the most important piece of legislation in this parliament to battling families there is a marked absence of contribution from government speakers.

        Looking through the debate, under the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996, four measures are being implemented on the pharmaceutical benefit scheme. The bill increases the concessional co&amp;hyphen;payment for all health care cardholders from $2.70 to $3.20 for each prescription. There is no compensation to users of the service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst the government says, `That is an increase of only 50c in the contribution. It's really not big potatoes at all. Who could really complain about that?', the reality is that over the period covered by this legislation

         $380 million will be ripped from the sick and their families across this nation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The co&amp;hyphen;payment for people who do not have access to the concessional card goes from $17.40 to $20. It also increases the general patient charge from $2.70 to $3.20. Again the government says, `Who could really complain about an increase of 50c?'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When you have only $1 left, 50c is half of it. It is all a matter of the perspective of the person and the family facing this expense. It is very easy for politicians on the other side to rail in support of this kind of legislation on the basis that it is not really very much as a unit charge increase. When children in a family are sick over the course of a week, the number of prescriptions required—the outlays involved—is of considerable importance to the family.

        This legislation is really about families. This government and some of the newer members—they have not yet learnt the reality of their leadership; that is coming for them; there is a very rude shock ahead of them—are gung&amp;hyphen;ho in putting down families. They mouth the language about families, they repeat all the code words, but this is where it matters. These are the items and expenditures that bear upon the standard of living of families and the hardship that can be created for families. It is only 50c, but it is another $180 million being stripped from sick families and sick individuals over the next four years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to that, the bill changes the indexation arrangements for the co&amp;hyphen;payments and the general safety net threshold. Previously the rounding rules were rounded down to the nearest 10c. Now the rounding can be either up or down to the nearest 10c.

        You say, again, `That doesn't seem to matter much at the moment'—until you look at the numbers and you find that the effect of that is to rip another $56 million from sick families over the next four years.

When the Community and Public Sector Union on 8 August 1996 released the list of 84 offices slated for closure—the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has now come into the chamber—the minister did not deny it.

        I will move to the issue of having Medicare agencies in selected pharmacies. When talking with representatives who have been in touch with the guild, you find that pharmacists generally are extremely concerned about this. The information available seems to indicate that the affected areas will be isolated locations only. But what criteria will be followed? Which pharmacy will get the nod out of the five or six pharmacies in the particular shopping centre, area or suburb, and on what basis will that happen? On what basis can you justify closing down a cash payment service at a Medicare office that is already operating effectively and that is well appreciated by the community who use it?

        Let me turn to the Commonwealth dental health program. I cannot think of a health care program, next to Medicare, that was more campaigned for over a longer period of time by the community than the Commonwealth dental health program. That program directly benefits people in pain and people who are suffering. Dental diseases cause pain and discomfort and they have a high economic impact. The information provided for 1983 shows that more than a million days of work were lost because of dental conditions. For the same period, over three million days of limited activity were associated with oral disease and pain. Dental decay is the most costly diet related disease in Australia, with annual costs of dental treatment exceeding $1,500 million.

The previous government legislated it for three years, which is standard practice across a range of programs—be they one year, two years or whatever. They are matters that one reviews as they come up. There is no doubt that, had our government continued, the program would have been continued.

        Let me turn to the other matter that is coming through from the budget into these bills—that is, the cut in funding for public hospitals. One cannot talk about pharmaceutical benefits and changes to the payments made by purchasers of pharmaceuticals and by patients without referring to the need for and funding of public hospitals. Again, we see the same system.

        I said in my earlier remarks that this government was in the pockets of the AMA. Many members of the AMA are proprietors of private hospitals. Many members of the AMA quite clearly have conflicts of interest in their relationships with private hospitals and in their dealings with patients. There is not a full disclosure of those relationships to patients at the time of treatment or the scheduling of treatment.

        What we see from this government—the government that is in the pockets of the AMA and the private health insurance funds—is any measure to reduce the standard of service at public hospitals. The loss of the $800 million that is being ripped out of the public hospital system over the next four years will have severe and damaging effects on the standard and availability of services provided by the public hospitals. Who suffers? Who goes on the end of the queue? The poorer people. Usually those most in need.

         So often, it is the poorer people who have the greater dietary problems, as we have seen in the figures in relation to dental health care. They are the people who get the worse kind of service. Who has to wait longer? They have to wait longer, because they do not have the resources to be able to avail themselves of the care of private hospitals. This government has thrown some $600 million at trying to get a 1&amp;half; per cent increase in the membership of private health funds. That $600 million is at the expense of the public health system, from which $800 million has been taken.

         The equivalent of that $800 million cut in funding for public hospitals is the closure of two major teaching hospitals, such as the John Hunter or the Prince Alfred. It is the equivalent of closing down 1,000 hospital beds. The government proclaims its concern for battling families but denies those most in need dental care and the availability of hospital beds when they are sick. What hypocrisy. That mock concern will be seen through.

         —It is critical that we look at why we are debating the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill and these amendments. These are not health measures; they are budget measures. They did not arrive in the parliament to give us a better health system. They are primarily here because they provide substantial `savings' in the budget. In other words, those people affected by it are not being affected to their benefit. They are being seen as people who can contribute money to government revenues. Many of them are not taxpayers but beneficiaries. In fact, the vast bulk of them are either pensioners or people with health care cards. In this new day and age they are seen as being appropriate targets for revenue raising.

The fact was that there was not an economic crisis at that time. No-one said, `The country is in a crisis requiring diabolical, massive measures.' That proposition was never raised, discussed or considered.

        Here we are, six months later, in a crisis. How did we get here? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) spent the last six months telling everybody what a crisis we are in. So this budget was developed to solve this fabricated crisis. However, having started that tap running—having started the crisis mentality—they are having trouble turning it off. One almost detects a note of anger in the government that people will not do what they are told and be confident again. Having spent six months telling them how bad things have been, the government now want to say that that was all a bit exaggerated. They have created a crisis by their rhetoric. Who are they conscripting to help? The people they promised they

But there is something even more striking. I think the current Prime Minister—who built his reputation supposedly on his economic, budgetary and treasury experiences—will go down in history as being similar to another Treasurer. I think he will become known as the Billy McMahon of the 1990s. He supposedly understood the Australian economy very well but never really did. He could never make the transition; he never grew up. He was fixed in a time warp 40 years ago. What we are seeing now is very reminiscent of the early 1970s, with a touch of the 1975s as well.

But link it with the abolition of the earnings averaging scheme, which allowed a pensioner to earn up to $1,000 a year without losing their pension. Prior to that scheme, often referred to as the `Santa Claus scheme', people who worked for a couple of weeks, say, at Christmas time, lost part of their pension. Under the earnings averaging scheme that did not happen; they did not lose their pension for that fortnight or three weeks work. But that scheme is going for a saving of $¼ million.

        I will address the specific issues of the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill first. The honourable shadow minister asked me two questions. The first question was: do countries provide reciprocal health benefit arrangements and is it going to apply to diplomats in Australia? We intend to apply this as broadly as we possibly can. It clearly will apply to any country with which we have a reciprocal health arrangement. For countries with which we do not have a reciprocal health arrangement, my understanding is at the moment it will apply to them, but we are trying to expand the number of countries with whom we have a reciprocal health arrangement because that is in both their interest and ours—particularly for Australians travelling overseas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second question the shadow minister asked me was: will you give an assurance that the bureaucratic requirements for pharmacies will be kept to a minimum? Yes, I will. We are having productive and fairly cooperative at this stage discussions with the Pharmacy Guild, and it is hardly our desire to put further work on them.

        There are basically two issues in the bill that the opposition will be opposing. That is obviously their right, but let me just talk about them. The first is an increase in the co-payment. Again, this was done simply because of the rate of growth in the pharmaceutical benefits system, and it is pretty frightening. We are paying out about $2.6 billion in pharmaceutical benefits. That is substantially larger than the budget of the state of Tasmania. If not a single new drug comes onto the PBS in the next four years, it will go up 50 per cent in cost. Clearly there will be new drugs.

        The best estimate, if we did nothing, is that in the next four years it will double in cost
        <break page="6055" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         again, as has happened in the last four years. Unfortunately, $2.6 billion is real money. Unless we do something to address that rate of growth, it will simply gobble up every other area of my health budget, and that includes things like Aboriginal health, public health, diabetes and immunisation. In the end, a health budget is finite, and if you have a Medicare benefit system and a pharmaceutical benefits system that are out of control the capacity to do things in other areas is severely limited.

        The average number of scripts that a concessional cardholder has is 17 a year. Therefore, the average number of scripts for people who are older concessional cardholders is 30 a year. I absolutely concede that the average concessional cardholder will be $8.50 a year worse off for that. For that extra $8.50 a year, they will get continuing access to the pharmaceutical benefits system, which is now vaguely under control in terms of cost. For the general cardholder, the average number of scripts is 1.6 a year. Going from $17.40 to $20, the average general PBS person who accesses it will be $4 a year worse off.

        The second major issue here is that of rounding. Rounding was devised by the previous government at a time when inflation was higher. If inflation is high, rounding works reasonably well and you can afford to round down. We are in a time of low inflation, and we hope that will exist for a substantially long time. In a time of low inflation, rounding down means effectively the script stays where it is forever and the intent of the initial legislation is not met. We are not rounding up all the time. We are simply saying it should be rounded up or down to the nearest 10c.

All that will happen for the general concession is that they will reach the safety net sooner and pay the same amount of money for the entire year.

         There were a couple of other comments that I should address. The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) made much about destroying Medicare as we know it. I would put this in the same sort of category of bleating and nitpicking. People can say it for as long as they like. We have Labor health ministers on the record saying that, if Medicare does not evolve, it is going to die—and it will. Any health system has to evolve. It has to look at new and better ways of doing things.

         I am absolutely unapologetic for trying to find a way to give some access to basic Medicare services for the large number of people in rural and remote Australia who have access to nothing whatsoever. That will occur by opening pharmacy agencies, which is going to be ecstatically popular. It will happen; it will happen before the next election; and it will certainly happen substantially by the end of this financial year.

         The member said that we are going to close a third of Medicare agencies: yes, we are going to close some agencies. I have not made a final decision on the closure of a single agency yet. As to the fact that a union chooses to release a list—you can take that for what I think it is worth. In many cases—when Medicare opened and offices were located—we were in a period when bulk-billing was substantially less and the need for cash was substantially greater. Bulk-billing has increased dramatically in the last 12 years. Off the top of my head, for vocationally registered GP services, about 86 to 87 per cent of all services are bulk&amp;hyphen;billed; for non-vocationally registered GP services, about 92 per cent of all services are bulk-billed. The need that might have existed 12 years ago does not exist today.

         The member for Shortland said that pharmacies are extremely concerned. Maybe he talks to different people. As I said, I think he will find that pharmacies can benefit from this proposal, and the pharmacists I talk to are ecstatic at the prospect.

         He did make one comment that I think is worth replying to seriously. He asked: what will happen in a town where there are five pharmacies, one pharmacy gets it and the others do not? That is a fair enough question. I do not want to incorporate something that becomes capitalised into the cost of a pharmacy and that gives one pharmacist a benefit over every other pharmacist.

         What we are looking to do at this stage where a situation like that existed—it is subject to final negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild—is to choose one pharmacy on the basis of certain merit that will be open and easily contestable. That agency would be contested again every couple of years. So they would have to keep winning it on merit. We will provide certain benefits and certain moneys to the pharmacy for doing that. We will do it to that one pharmacy but, because it is openly contestable every couple of years, it will not get capitalised into the cost. We will let every other pharmacy in the town have access to the same thing, if they wish, at their cost. The benefit will be in terms of a Commonwealth payment, but we will not exclude other pharmacies in that town so that everyone will have access to it. I think it will work very well.

         The member for Shortland made some comments about giving health to the states and how we will have eight to nine different health systems. If that is what he thinks, I have to wonder why the previous government attempted to do something on the whole COAG process for the past six years, because they did try and they failed. I might fail but I am certainly going to try. I am going to try because the benefits are very substantial.

         One example is in palliative care. Eighty per cent of people who are dying would like to die at home. It is cheap for people to die at home. People can die at home for an average cost of $50 a day. That involves backup, if they need it, of up to six hours individualised nursing care per person per day. These figures come from the Silver Chain Nursing Association in Western Australia. You might then ask: if people want to die at home and can die at home for a tenth of the cost of dying in a public hospital, why are a substantial number of people still dying in public hospitals? The simple reason is that the states pay for the public hospitals while the Commonwealth pays for home based care. The two have never been able to get together and agree on a way of doing something that will be of benefit to the public.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another example is with nursing home care for people who have become frail and aged. While there are 75,000 people who are in nursing homes around Australia, there are another 75,000 people who are being looked after by friends and relatives. The crunch point for the family will be when the person becomes incontinent because then, all of a sudden, the care goes up fairly dramatically. The family will need to find another $2,500 to $3,000 a year for incontinence aids. I can offer that family a nursing home bed at $32,000 a year but I cannot offer the family $2,500 to $3,000 for incontinence aids to keep the person out of the nursing home and let them look after the relative at home. That shows the fundamental stupidity of our present system. We run the nursing homes; the states are responsible for appliances; but the two do not have the capacity to get together and talk about it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When looking at the long-term future of hospitals, the trend right around the world is to attempt to put as much community based care as possible in place, because it is cheaper and it is what people want. For instance, there

        <para first-indent="16">
         What is stopping them getting that figure down even further is that they cannot provide the home based care to back up what they need to do to further use their hospital beds in a sensible way. That would be okay if we had a magic pudding and did not have to worry about increased technology, an ageing population or any of those things. Unless we seriously try to sort out some of these stupid inequities, the health system will not evolve, it will be unsustainable and it will continue to not meet people's needs.

        The reason I ask this is that, in Senate estimates, the department advised us that no such assurances have been given by the department, the minister or the minister's office. I would like to hear from the minister himself that no such assurances have been given to any member or senator that their particular Medicare office will remain open. If the minister has given such an assurance, I would be very interested to know the circumstances, given that he claims not to have made any final decision on the future of any particular Medicare office. If that is the case, that will certainly clarify things for many of us.

        As to multiple pharmacies in Ballarat, Bendigo or any other particular town, the minister has said that there will be an open and contestable process for deciding which is the lucky pharmacy—whether it is in one of those towns or another town. Could the minister confirm what that open and contestable process might be? For example, will it be an auction, or will it be some process that requires the pharmacy concerned to part with money to the government? I would be grateful if the minister could clarify those issues.

        I have had a very large number of conversations with my colleagues—without giving specific examples; I cannot say. There are clearly some very large offices that it would be impossible to close. There are some very large Medicare offices where the number of new claims is not dropping, where doctors may not bulk bill much and where there is still a very large need because there may not be another office in close proximity.

        So it is possible to say that there are a number of offices that will not be closing. Off the top of my head, I am not able to give that answer. It is quite possible that some offices could be staying open definitely because, as I said, the decision has been on the basis that none have been decided to be closed. Clearly, some will need to stay open.

        Against this background there is an unresolved question as to when the minister resigned as a director and secretary of Tunboa. The minister has not yet provided a clear answer to that question. It appears to me, however, that irrespective of when he resigned as a director and secretary of Tunboa, the Minister for Finance has breached the Corporations Law in a number of serious respects—at least four separate breaches.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister admits that he had absolutely no involvement with Tunboa after 1986, including in the capacity of a director or secretary. He admits that during this period Tunboa traded, yet he has apparently not resigned as a director and secretary until the last week or so, therefore remaining a director and secretary of Tunboa for some 10 years without performing the duties required.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the circumstances, the minister appears to have failed to have exercised the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in a like position in a corporation would exercise—a breach of section 232(4) of the Corporations Law. Furthermore, it is doubtful that the minister complied with his specific duties in respect of the director's statement required by section 301 of the Corporations Law.

         August 1986. For a company to operate with only one director is contrary to section 219 of the old Companies Code and contrary to section 221 of the new Corporations Law, until section 221 was amended in December 1995.

        And there is more!

        Section 83(2) of the Corporations Law deems a secretary to be knowingly concerned, unless the contrary is proved, in any contravention of various sections, including failure to notify the Australian Securities Commission of any changes in directors or company secretary, or failure to provide an annual return which contains the required details.

        The Australian Securities Commission has produced the `Company Director's Survival Kit'. In this kit the ASC makes it clear that the duties and responsibilities of company directors are very serious indeed. It says the law takes a very strict approach. The duties owed by directors and other officers are viewed as virtually the same as the duties owed by a trustee of the estate of a deceased person. They also say that—and I quote:

         if the Finance Minister does not attend to these matters, how can the ASC or the courts expect anyone else to?

I call on the Australian Securities Commission to investigate these important matters as a matter of urgency.

The motive behind this decision would appear logical in an academic sense. Drawing the present junta into the regional community was expected to encourage the regime to reform from within. The result has in fact been the opposite. A worst case scenario came to pass. A brutal regime craving legitimacy was emboldened by the granting of observer status.

        Tonight I want to repudiate utterly the hatred and fear unleashed by comments by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), the Mayor of Port Lincoln and others in the community. I recognise that the support occurring in many quarters for these comments is largely based on economic uncertainty and very rapid change in our community. It is only natural, in some respects, that the sort of scapegoating that we have seen in many societies will emerge in these circumstances. It is incumbent upon us all to emphasise the great benefits that immigration from all societies
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         has given and will continue to give Australia. For example, greater access to markets in our region, greater skills and diversity—a whole range of benefits.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Oxley has made numerous ridiculous statements. The suggestion that the problems of Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Rwanda are examples of multiculturalism at work are an example of how ludicrous some of her statements are. Another of her allegations is that Asian Australians form ghettos. I live in an area where there are so&amp;hyphen;called ghettos. I represent an area where particular ethnic groups are gathered together. Looking at some of the tenants councils in those areas that I represent, there are Vietnamese Australians, Somalian Australians, Timorese Australians, Chinese Australians, Turkish Australians, Latin American Australians and Anglo Australians all working together and living basically in harmony, no less harmoniously than other people in the community around them, all interacting in a positive way. It is ludicrous to suggest that they are ghettos. I have played in local cricket teams with Vietnamese cricketers. My doctor is Indian Australian. Numerous other professionals that I deal and interact with in the community are of Asian origin.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Oxley suggested that Asian Australians are of different religion and, therefore, that is some sort of criterion for keeping them out. I thought we had freedom of religion in this country. I would also point out that a very substantial proportion of Asian migrants coming to Australia are in fact Christians. A big proportion of the Vietnamese are Catholics. Most Filipinos are Catholics. A significant proportion of Chinese origin migrants are Christians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The final and perhaps ultimately most ridiculous statement is that Aboriginal Australians are not disadvantaged because of their Aboriginality—surely a classic example of the great comment by Tacitus that we definitely must hate the ones we have hurt.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is already clear that this gospel of hate is causing great problems for Australia through increased racial vilification and even violence and is damaging us overseas. The refusal by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to tackle the
        <break page="6063" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         issue head&amp;hyphen;on is contributing to that problem. He has gone to extreme lengths to avoid the headline, `Howard repudiates Hanson' because of a two&amp;hyphen;faced approach in pursuit of the votes that appear to be there in support of her views.

        So he is happy to say, `Yes, I believe in non&amp;hyphen;discrimination' but he will avoid at all cost any sort of repudiation of her position that leads to a headline, `Howard repudiates Hanson' because he is after those votes. He is playing with fire and he does not care what that does to Australia's reputation overseas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Like the member for Oxley, when he talks about political correctness the Prime Minister represents a view that looks back to the 1950s. I grew up in an era of different political correctness when women were second&amp;hyphen;class citizens, censorship was rampant, Aborigines were almost seen as subhuman, sex was a deep, dark secret and single mothers were in some way pariahs in the community. That was when you had serious political correctness and the main perpetrators of this were the National Party.

In saying that, I include most working&amp;hyphen;class Australians.

        For a start, the member for Batman said I have nothing to say at the moment about the question of unemployment. I don't think I have ever stopped talking about employment prospects in the Townsville region since I stepped into this parliament. Indeed, the CES presently has unlimited funds to support apprenticeships and traineeships in the Townsville region, which is great news.

         Townsville State High School and TORGAS like the program.

         I would like to remind the member for Batman that, under Labor, apprenticeship and traineeship numbers fell to their lowest levels in some 30 years—not to mention what happened to unemployment and interest rates. That shows just how committed the former government was to creating job prospects for Australia's young men and women. I am pleased to say that this government, unlike the previous government, is committed to turning that situation around. Earlier this month the member for Batman said:

         The member was talking about employment at that time. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will go a long way to fixing many things in my electorate of Herbert, the electorate of Batman and throughout Australia. The Democrats have now taken the responsible step of working with the government instead of obstructing for the sake of obstructing, and the bill will be implemented at an early date.

         In September 1995, the Townsville Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 500 businesses in the Townsville region,  conducted a survey of its members. The survey was conducted to identify issues Townsville businesses wanted the Chamber of Commerce to address for them. The No. 1 issue of concern that was identified by the Townsville Chamber of Commerce was the unfair dismissal laws.

          spoken in this chamber, he has mentioned the words `unfair dismissal law' only once, and when he did he claimed the law has helped to create some 730,000 jobs throughout Australia—probably mostly lawyers.

         Mr Speaker, do you know who else wants to see the unfair dismissal laws repealed? None other than the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr. The Labor Premier of New South Wales certainly said that kids are going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provisions in the federal law work. The unfair dismissal laws Labor introduced by stealth did more to stifle employment and punish small business in Townsville and Australia than any other single decision in the last 13 years.

         —The drug problems of the Sydney suburb of Cabramatta have been well documented in the media over the last few years. Having lived next door to Cabramatta most of my life—my electorate covered that suburb before the last boundary change—I have watched time and time again community leaders, politicians and ordinary citizens try to come up with solutions to the problem. Not only has no solution been forthcoming but the problem has become much worse.

        highlighted the continuing study of Dr Lisa Maher, an academic with the National Drug and Alcohol Research Council at the University of New South Wales. The article exposed a new breed of addicts shooting up in the alleys, doorways and stairwells of Cabramatta. They are children—children who do not fit the traditional stereotype we imagine when we hear the word `junkie'. It personally made my skin crawl knowing that many of those kids

Let me use her words:

        This is a tragedy that is being lived every day of the week in my community, and it is a tragedy that takes other perverse forms. The improper disposal of syringes by drug users has now reached epidemic proportions in my area. Residents' tempers have reached breaking point as they wake up every morning to syringes lying in their front gardens. Parents are pulling out their hair in fear and frustration as their children play in these secluded parklands popular with addicts. Small business owners are losing their customers as people fear to shop in the more secluded area populated with the users or fear to walk down public stairwells in parking centres, knowing full well they will have to run the gauntlet of discarded used needles.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I can appreciate, looking at the overall needle exchange program, that the problem of improper needle disposal would seem a small one. However, when you realise that Sydney's intravenous drug problem is now centred on a several kilometre radius in Sydney's south&amp;hyphen;west and that, of the small percentage of needles not returned under the needle exchange program, most are now left in backyards, frontyards, laneways and the parks of my community, I am sure you can understand that what seems now like a small problem is

        At the core of this problem are the addicts who are getting around the needle exchange program—they are not actually part of it—who buy their needles from pharmacists and feel no compulsion or responsibility to dispose of their syringes correctly or exchange them safely with the authorities. The question is how do we stop this.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Well, I can say what the answer is not. It is not to put an end to the needle exchange program operating in Cabramatta. From talking to people on the ground who are very much involved with addicts on a day-to-day basis, part of the answer is to improve the service and to work harder at impressing upon users that, despite what they may think, they have a responsibility to dispose of their syringes safely and considerately. It can and must be done.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We have a responsibility to the ordinary, hardworking citizens of our area to clean up the used needle problem, but we also have a responsibility to provide clean needles to the children of our community who are now paying $30 for a cap of heroin in some back alley of Cabramatta. We can cure them of heroin addiction; we cannot cure them of AIDS.

        At present the only needle exchange centre operating in Cabramatta is run by a group of committed youth workers at the Cabramatta Community Youth Centre. This centre is due to close on 1 December. Fairfield City Council will soon take a vote on the development application for an improved centre run by professional staff who are experienced in the field of drug rehabilitation. If the application is denied, then basically no centre will exist in Cabramatta—no needles will be exchanged, the needle disposal problem will get even further out of control and the number of HIV/AIDS cases will skyrocket. A new needle exchange centre—run by professionals—will develop a more effective outreach campaign to users, which will hopefully result in less needles in my constituents' backyards. On the other side of the coin, perhaps we need to

        I am no expert on this matter, but I wonder if anyone has looked at the practicalities of initiating a system where bona fide users of needles for medical reasons carry some sort of identification or doctor's certificate to display when they purchase their syringes from a chemist. This would mean addicts would have to report to the needle exchange centre, dirty needles in hand, to obtain clean needles for use. As I said, I am no expert, but I would be interested to hear whether such an arrangement is workable. It certainly has not been tried.

         —I concur with what the previous speaker, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), has just said. I rise tonight to speak on an issue which should concern anyone who has ever placed a child in a shopping trolley. Research in the United States has revealed that almost 25,000 children a year are treated in emergency departments for injuries sustained following falls from a shopping trolley. What makes these statistics even more frightening is the fact that 79 per cent of these injuries occur to the head and neck. This increases to 92 per cent for children under the age of one year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The researcher who compiled these figures came to the conclusion that shopping trolleys should be banned until they are redesigned for safety. An assistant professor of paediatrics at the Ohio State University said that these are not trivial injuries and that they can be life threatening. `So what!' I hear you say.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         `You're talking about the United States.' Well, Mr Speaker, it is an unfortunate fact that, every week, one in four supermarkets across Australia has a shopping trolley related accident.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Mater Children's Hospital in Queensland has carried out a survey of shopping trolley accidents based solely on patients who have been presented to the casualty departments of the seven hospitals in the Brisbane South health region. In the four years from 1988 to 1991, these hospitals reported 101 injuries: 81 per cent of these occurred to children under the age of five, 18 per cent required hospitalisation, 34 per cent suffered concussion and five per cent suffered fractures to the skull. While the majority of these injuries were sustained from falls, more than a third were sustained when the trolley containing the child toppled over.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the year ending June 1995 there were 15 recorded injuries. Of these, two required hospitalisation and one was so serious the child had to be transferred to a larger hospital for specialist treatment. Thankfully, there is no record in this report of a death occurring due to a fall. However, this is not the case in the United States, where a three&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old and an infant died in separate accidents in 1992. Hopefully, we will never witness a death in this country through something so simple as a fall from a shopping trolley.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Unfortunately, the danger is ever present under the current system. You see, there are currently no laws governing the design of shopping trolleys. This point has been brought to my attention by a constituent of mine, Mrs Kerrie Beaver. Mrs Beaver has done extensive research into the matter and has uncovered a swag of information which suggests current shopping trolleys are not designed for the safe transport of children. Further to this, research shows that children transported unrestrained in shopping trolleys can fall easily. However, simply adding restraining belts to current models will not prevent the trolley from tipping. Of course, shopping trolleys were originally designed for one purpose—to make it convenient to carry one's groceries, not to carry children. What is needed is a trolley which will satisfy both needs.
       </para>
       <break page="6067" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         According to research carried out to date, the ideal shopping trolley would have an extra large basket for storage, a wide basket for stability, high sides to prevent children falling out, the basket position lowered to give a safe centre of gravity and a wide wheel arrangement. Also, the seat should offer more than one position so as to accommodate children of differing sizes, and a suitable restraining device should be fitted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many of those present in the House may feel this is a trivial matter. Indeed, Brisbane's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sunday Mail
         </emphasis>
         made light of the issue in a recent issue, suggesting I was trying for the housewife's vote. All I can say to those who feel this way is this: take a walk through any children's ward of any hospital and then tell me that injury to a child is a trivial matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is for the reasons I have outlined tonight that I have joined with Mrs Beaver in her quest to have a national standard introduced for the design of shopping trolleys. I feel this is long overdue and, if we can avoid just one more child being injured, it would be well worth the effort.
