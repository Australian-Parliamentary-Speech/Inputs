        Do you believe that a Telstra in private hands, in the hands of shareholders who are foreign investors, is going to care about providing cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies of $13.5 million or $4.5 million or $1 million? Do you believe that the additional words in the legislation `efficiently and economically' will have a different meaning in government members' electorates? Surely these members realise that they are threatening the quality and price of basic telecommunication services to customers in their electorates.

        What particular bond of faith do all government members place on the foreign investors in London, Washington and New York on having special regard for the electors of Capricornia, Dawson, Northern Territory, Farrer, McEwen, Gippsland, Page and Gilmore? What faith can they put in these foreign owners? Do they not know of the ruthless way shareholders, particularly those foreign share investors from London, Washington and New York, judge efficiency and economics? It is the bottom line on the account that counts at the end of the day. The more profit the better. The better the ability to minimise tax obligations the better. The lower the number of employees to worry about the better.

       <para first-indent="16">
        These will be the efficient and economic ways private owners and foreign investors will judge the operations of Telstra. They will do away with the equity in the provision for all Australians of basic telecommunications services and develop a structure of information rich Australians as opposed to information poor Australians. There are no prizes for guessing who the mugs are going to be. Rural and regional Australians will suffer because of this partial sale and the downgrading of the

        We will seek to delete the words `efficiently and economically' from this bill. They do not appear in the Telecommunications Act 1991 and they should not appear in this legislation. There is no place for them in such a diverse country with such scattered population centres in the bush, provincial centres and cities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is being too clever by half by including such words into this legislation. The hardheads in the government know the results of this phrase—Telstra, because of its shareholders and foreign investor influence, will be required to withdraw from the provision of cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies to rural and regional Australia. While the hardheads in the government know this absolutely, I am not so sure that other government members, of whom I have made mention previously, understand this point.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I repeat: government members are putting their electorates on a collision course with efficiency and economics. By voting for this legislation, they will allow the investors in London and New York to gut telecommunications services from their electorates and the people. Significantly, the government, by this partial sale of Telstra, is also allowing Telstra—an Australian institution—to be gutted.

        Private investors will seek a sharp reduction in staffing levels. This view is supported by the privatisation of British Telecom. British Telecom's staff now stands at a little over 50 per cent of its 1984 levels. Staff reductions in New Zealand have halved since privatisation in 1990. I say to the many members on the government side who represent rural areas: you know as well as I do that Telstra provides an important source of employment to many of those provincial towns and cities, and staff reductions will have a serious impact on your electorates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Staff cuts will increase profitability in the shorter term, but in the longer term this comes at the expense of service quality. Telecom New Zealand reduced its staff by one-third between 1993 and 1995. Over that

        At the same time, Telecom New Zealand was able to take advantage of New Zealand's anti-union legislation, the Employment Contracts Act, to erode working conditions with the company. Participants in a union survey conducted last year indicated that workers regularly worked more than 40 hours per week with no overtime payments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Obviously some tactics have been learnt by the government from its trans-Tasman talks. The government promised at the 2 March election to restore employment to Australians. Here the government has its first opportunity to give some substance to this promise, but what will it do instead? It will let Telstra take the hit into private ownership, and it will directly reduce jobs in Telstra. The overseas experience is very clear in this regard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Regrettably, if this were not worse, job losses are also set to come because of the withdrawal of the universal service obligation of Telstra. The small businesses, which the government never stopped mentioning during the election campaign, are going to face increased telephone costs, especially in rural and regional Australia.

        As the complaints start to stream into my office and the offices of my colleagues, we will be sure to tell the people why they have to pay more for basic telecommunications services. We will be pleased to tell them why the cost of calls made from public pay phones has increased dramatically. We will also tell them why they are now charged for seeking directory assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The privatisation of Telstra is going to mean increases in the annual cost of a telephone line in New South Wales of between $200 and $ 3,500; in Victoria, between $200 and $1,800; in Queensland, between $200 and $2,500; in South Australia, between $400 and $6,800; and in Western Australia, between $500 and $4,200. The standard line rental charge for residential customers at the moment is $139 per year.

        In the first eight years of privatisation in the United Kingdom, local call prices increased
        <break page="699" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         by 27 per cent and the cost of domestic household phone installation increased by more than 60 per cent. This experience was repeated in New Zealand.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Don't be conned into believing what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said about timed local calls, because what we are talking about at the moment is timed local calls in a zone. What the Prime Minister has never said is what will happen if Telstra reduces those zones. For example, say you ring from Heathcote to anywhere in Sydney. What would happen if there were about five different zones there and the zone, as it is, would stay and the local timed calls would stay there but, instead of having one local time zone for the whole of, say, Sydney or Melbourne, like they do in many places such as London and New York, you may have eight, 10 or 12 local zones?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, instead of being able to increase that local zone out, as we are pushing to do—take Sydney, for example, which I am more familiar with—to, say, the Campbelltown area, and in my own area in Wollongong there is a strong campaign to have that increased to Wollongong, what you are going to find under this legislation and with privatisation is that, instead of expanding that local call area you are going to retract it and make say four or five or six areas. Take someone on the North Shore of Sydney trying to ring, say, Sutherland. Instead of that being a local call in that zone, as it is at the moment, you may well find that it goes across three zones. So it will be an STD call. Going on past experience of what happened overseas, that is what will happen.

        Universal service depends not only on the affordability of current services but also on the future investment decision. This is bad legislation; it is legislation that should be opposed; and it is legislation that will be opposed on this side of the House. It is unfortunate that this is one of the first pieces of legislation that is to be brought in. I oppose the legislation, and I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).

I do not believe that I am entitled to say that everybody who voted for me would necessarily support all aspects of Labor Party policy, just as I do not believe that all those who voted for my Liberal opponent were necessarily committed to every aspect of Liberal policy. The difficulty in this case is that, although I believe it would be true to say that a great majority of people in my electorate would be opposed to the sale of Telstra, I do not believe I am entitled to say that there is an unequivocal mandate that compels me to oppose this legislation on the basis of the vote I received.

        Equally, one may well ponder the question to Liberal colleagues: why was so much money spent in the Liberal campaign demonising Paul Keating? Why was so much money spent on other aspects of that campaign?

        The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has on a previous occasion said that the argument for a mandate—for this proposal—is worthless. The factors that influence people on how they vote and why they vote vary not merely from electorate to electorate but for a whole variety of reasons. A very nice young man from my electorate, who I presume was a supporter of the Liberal Party, was giving out Liberal tickets, and he came up and spoke to me quite politely. He explained that the prime reason he was voting Liberal was that he had never lived under a Liberal government, and he wanted to know what it was like. I gave him some advice about that, which he obviously did not take.

From overseas experience, you have only to look at the collapse of the Allende government, which had been democratically elected. A significant factor in the overthrow of that government by the army, the colonels, was the fact that a foreign company owned the telecommunications network. That has been documented; it is a historic fact. This government has a blind spot because it believes deep in its heart that private enterprise will always deliver a better product at the end of the day than a government owned instrument.

         Public ownership of Telstra is vitally important to ensure that all Australians continue to have equal and fair access to the rapidly growing telecommunication and information sectors. It would be an abdication of our responsibility as legislators if we were to let a situation develop whereby we would have in this country an elite group of information rich and a large group of information poor.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Not only do the coalition's plans for Australia's largest government owned asset have the potential to undermine universal access to quality telecommunications services, but they may also detract from competition within the telecommunications industry and lead to a significant diminution of opportunity for the local production of telecommunications equipment. There is a whole range of Australian industry developing good technology, dependent upon the feeding line that Telstra supplies. It is absolutely essential for the ongoing development of our industry that Telstra can continue to offer such opportunities.

         Furthermore, there is cause for concern that this sell&amp;hyphen;off may also lead to timed local calls. That has been disputed by many, but I do not think it has been examined fully and carefully. I fear that a privatised Telstra would be able to introduce timed local calls by stealth. They would do this by redefining a local call by making the `local' area smaller. For example, in my own region, Canberra and Queanbeyan—which is just over the ACT border—currently share a common phone area. In the future, a privatised Telstra could very easily redefine the local zone by creating two local call zones in this one area. People making telephone calls between Canberra and Queanbeyan could find themselves in the position of going from one local zone to another and therefore being subjected to timed

         Given the continuing changes in technology and the costs associated with the R&amp;D aspect of technology development—for example, photovoltaics and a whole new range of technologies which are being examined and implemented—the ability of a privatised Telstra to continue to deliver services in an equitable manner without cross&amp;hyphen;subsidy would be in doubt. When we look at the area of developing technology there is no reason at all for us to believe that a privatised Telstra would automatically be able to afford—or wish to afford—to continue the delivery of service without cross-subsidy.

         The coalition have argued that the partial privatisation of Telstra is an essential micro-economic reform. I strongly disagree. Privatisation in itself is not micro-economic reform. There is no automatic gain in economic efficiency by transferring ownership from the public to the private sector. It is competition—not privatisation—that will produce efficiencies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The result of this sell&amp;hyphen;off could in fact be a reduction in competition within the telecommunications industry. Telstra has considerable advantage over its competitors at the moment because it owns the network infrastructure—the phone connections to every home in the country. It would be in the interests of a privatised Telstra to use that natural monopoly power to eliminate its competitors.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In stark contrast to the approach of the coalition, the former Labor government instituted sensible reforms in the communications sector. The Labor government introduced competition in service delivery, that is, effective competition between carriers—literally from the telephone socket in the wall. The results of this policy are there for everyone to see.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have seen a massive increase in investment in communications infrastructure. Exports  of  telecommunications equipment from this  country  have  gone  from  $200  million to  over  $1 billion  a  year.  A  huge range of services are opening up to consumers.
         <break page="704" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Telstra's customer services have improved dramatically. The whole range of opportunity within this industry has improved enormously. All of these things have occurred as a direct result of the Labor government introducing proper competition in the early 1990s. Telstra did not have to be privatised to achieve these outstanding results.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another aspect of the proposed Telstra privatisation that has been overlooked, or probably ignored, by the government is the difficulties associated with partial privatisation. Should the privatisation go ahead, there would be a fundamental conflict of interest between the minority private shareholders and the government as the majority shareholder.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If Telstra is to be purely profit driven—and what private shareholder would expect anything less than that—then it will not be in the company's interest to continue to provide universal service to all Australians; that is, the maintenance of cross-subsidies for rural and regional areas must surely, automatically, be under threat. If Telstra is to continue to provide universal service, it must do so at the expense of higher profit. Again, this is not in the interests of private shareholders. The conflict of interest between the private shareholder and the government—that is, the constituents; the taxpayers who expect fair access—is evident.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The inclusion of performance standards in the Telstra bill will do very little to counter the fact that a privatised Telstra will not protect the public interest. The inclusion of these standards appears to be more about diverting public attention away from the privatisation issue than any real concern for the performance of the organisation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I draw to the attention of honourable members opposite the potential for a privatised Telstra to place charges on services such as directory assistance. The temptation to do this would be enormous and understandable. The $80 million in revenue that would be obtained from such a move would be very attractive to private shareholders, but it would come at the expense of many—the sight impaired, mobile phone users, the elderly or people like you and me who forget to carry our phone books with us, which is quite simple to do.

          In a desperate attempt to find something to talk about, the members opposite have tried to argue that because Labor has supported the privatisation of certain government business enterprises in the past then it must automatically support all privatisation. This is not only idiotic but also quite an insipid argument. There is a world of difference between the privatisation of Telstra as we are seeing it now and the privatisations in the past of institutions like the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. We need to put this on record. The Commonwealth Bank is one of four major banks. It services only about 20 per cent of the banking sector in Australia. It does not have anywhere near the level of market power that Telstra has. Furthermore, the government has maintained a degree of regulatory control over the banking industry via the Reserve Bank.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Like the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas was also one of many service providers in a competitive marketplace. Qantas has about 50 per cent of the domestic air travel business and under 40 per cent of the international air travel business in and out of Australia. It is only a small proportion of the population who regularly use the services of an airline. Most importantly, both the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas needed injections of federal funds, taxpayers' money, from time to time for capital expenditure. In contrast, Telstra raises all its own investment funds. It is not a drain on the federal Treasury for capital expenditure.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The other aspect of this debate is the coalition's shameless linking of their environment package to the sale of Telstra. The members opposite want people to believe that anyone who does not agree with the flogging off of Telstra is anti-environment. They continue to claim the sole right to environmental concern. This is an absolute affront to the majority of the Australian community. It is also a monopoly that the environment does not need and, frankly, is not one that the environment could afford.

For people outside this place, do not be conned by the line that the coalition government has suddenly discovered and protected the environment. If the coalition really believed in their environment package, they would not need to privatise Telstra to fund it. I note that they were able to find the money needed to placate their business friends on the issue of tariff concessions. It is amazing that they need to sell Telstra to suddenly have a thing for the environment. I find it quite a contradiction.

I agree with the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports, when he asks: what next will we see flogged off, what next will we see as an excuse? Make no bones about it, the coalition had planned to sell Telstra. They knew it would be difficult, if not impossible, without a hook upon which to hang it.

        Those 11 reasons are very good reasons why this parliament should reject the sale of one-third of Telstra. The reality is that the government does not intend to sell one-third of Telstra; it intends to sell all of it. There is not much point just selling one-third of it. If you sell one-third of it, the government loses all control over the company anyway. This is just the first shot across the bows; it will be a salami slice job where one-third goes now, one-third later and one-third after that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Ultimately, the people who own the biggest company in Australia, Telstra—people should understand that Telstra is the biggest business in this country; it is currently owned by every individual taxpayer—will shortly see, if the present coalition government gets its way, that many parts of it will be owned by overseas investors. The ownership of this very strategic business will move out of the absolute control of Australian hands and move to others. The opposition does not believe that that is something that should be done. The opposition is firmly of the view, as I believe the majority of the Australian people are, that this business should stay in the government's hands.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Members of the opposition say that they have a mandate for selling Telstra. If you went through all the obscure highways and byways of the opposition's policy that they ran to the election and on, they will probably say that they have a mandate for everything. When people vote in elections in Australia, they tend to vote for a variety of issues. As my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) said earlier, they might
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         have even voted for someone because they thought they were attractive. But this is certainly not a policy that is attractive.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If you polled all the Australian people and asked them, `Do you think the government should sell Telstra, yes or no? the resounding answer would be no, because they know that it is an Australian icon and the government is getting rid of that. They know that Telstra provides 90 per cent of the nation's telecommunications services. In some ways they have  voted on whether or not they wanted government to get rid of Telstra. In all the ballots that were held about whether people wanted to have Optus or Telstra as their telephone company, the vast majority voted for Telstra. When they were voting for Telstra in those ballots about Optus and Telstra, they were really choosing whether they wanted the government company or the private company.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In those ballots, even in Melbourne, where Optus said they were going to do terrifically, they did badly. Optus got a very small market share out of those ballots. Telstra got over 75 per cent of the market share out of those ballots. That was the people specifically saying that they wanted to choose Telstra, the government company, over Optus, the private enterprise company. We have really had a ballot from the Australian people about what they think, but that does not suit the current government, which has this ideological obsession that somehow or other private enterprise is better than government enterprise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition agree that in many areas private enterprise is better, or preferable if it is not necessarily better. In some areas there is a need for the government to have an absolute interest. Telecommunications is one of those areas. At present Telstra has a natural monopoly. It is the biggest government owned asset. Telstra's profits after tax in 1994-95 were $1.753 billion and its total value added represents 2.2 per cent of GDP. This is something that is owned by the people and it is the largest business in the country.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The reality is that Telstra also has a lot of strategic interest for Australians. It has a lot more interest for Australians than it does for any other country in the world. The Australian population is the most widely dispersed of

         any of the developed countries in the world. There is a thick band of population around the eastern seaboard, a few nodes in the centre and on the west and a very sparse population spread over the only continental country on earth. Currently, Telstra has provided a service to those people. It has put a direct dial telephone into nearly every house in the country—one of the most remarkable engineering achievements of the 20th century to cover a country like this which has a dispersed population.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A private company would not do that because a private company's business is making a profit. The result of Telstra becoming a private company is that the concentration will be on making money for the shareholders and the interest will then go to where the most profit is. The most profit for Telstra is on the eastern seaboard of Australia down to that tip around Melbourne. There is no real profit for it in Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia or the outback parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. There is no profitability there for it at all.

        The directors of any company that is trying to make a profit and has private shareholders have an obligation to maximise the profit for distribution to the shareholders.

It will be a good service for people who are in the concentrated population areas like Sydney and Melbourne. It will be a terrible service for people out in the bush. That would be a tragedy for Australia.

We believe that the same sorts of services should be available to all Australians, whether they live in the bush or in the city.

That was one of the promises they made during the election—snake oil sales from the then opposition. Members of the National Party ran around the country saying, `We're going to do this.'

         At least if the government still owned Telstra they would be able to get Telstra on the track and doing something about it. But if Telstra is a private company, and if it costs $15,000 or $20,000 to put an ISDN line onto some farm out in the bush, they will say, `That's fine. It will cost you $15,000 or $20,000.' It will not be the same cost for someone in the city and the current subsidy will go. The government will say, `Yes, but we're going to put that on the record,' but the reality is that they are not. One part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa laments the fact that the government will not be accountable for where they are going with the universal service obligation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We are also concerned that this legislation will take away the preserve for ministerial direction and accountability to the parliament for the delivery of Telstra's universal service obligations.

          Telstra also makes very substantial contributions to the government through income tax. Last year it paid $649 million to the federal government. It does not minimise its tax payments, as private companies do. Once the government privatises Telstra, it will be able to utilise all sorts of legitimate tax minimisation mechanisms, which will ensure that the return to the people through the tax cut will be even less.

          Another very important issue that I would like to mention in the few moments left to me is the effect the sale of Telstra will have on the Australian electronics industry. The minister will go on with a lot of cant about how Telstra has always bought from Australians and how Telstra will continue to buy from Australians. If that is so, we would be interested to hear the government's response to the proposition made by the member for Werriwa that the government should legislate for that. We believe that a buy Australia policy for Telstra should be legislated for.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At present, over 70 per cent of Telstra's equipment, materials and services is purchased from Australian firms, big and small. Telstra is the biggest buyer in the country. A privatised Telstra would not be required to maintain such purchasing policies. The same thing would then happen with Telstra as happened with Optus, where Optus's partners—North American telephone companies—are purchasing their equipment overseas. Telstra will have pressure from its shareholders to maximise their profits, saying that Telstra should buy wherever in the world it is most competitive to buy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That would put the electronics industry at great risk. That industry has been one of the very great success stories in Australia over the last 15 or 20 years. We have seen the development of an industry which gives us a world edge. We have seen an industry develop which has relied, in many instances, on getting its start through either defence or Telstra contracts. Telstra is one of the largest customers of the Australian electronics industry and, with that pressure from shareholders, that will go.

         <break page="709" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           The government should be sincere about this, recognise that the electronics industry is an important part of Australian industry, and legislate to provide that a minimum of 70 per cent of Telstra's equipment, materials and services be purchased from Australian companies. That is fair and reasonable. If the present system is working well and there was bipartisan support for it, let us put it in the legislation to make sure that the new owners of Telstra do this. Everyone thought that the owners of Optus were going to do this and they did not.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           So, for all the reasons outlined by the member for Werriwa, we should not be passing this bill as it is. The opposition has a number of specific amendments that it intends to move at the consideration in detail stage of the bill. We hope the government will accept those amendments because they will make it a better bill and it will be better for Australia.

Ultimately, if it comes to that, I will support the amendments to be moved in subsequent stages of the proceedings. I do that because this is not a policy for all Australians. This is a policy for a narrow, ideologically driven government which supports the option to provide a policy for this country which will not deliver the telecommunications standards which we have come to expect.

          —No. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who formerly had some interest in the area of privatisation but perhaps has less these days, certainly has failed to deliver to the public a policy in this area of privatisation which will actually meet the demands of this country into the next century. The reality is that this bill is probably the worst of all worlds for telecommunications ownership. The bill does not pass the appropriate tests which the public of Australia will come to impose on this government on the way in which its ideologically driven decisions in this area actually supplant public interest.

         The reality is that Telstra is not the same as many other areas of government ownership which have been privatised in the past. Telstra is in quite a different category, as the debacle over the joint venture agreement during the election campaign showed. The then opposition, now the government, regarded as quite unacceptable the joint venture arrangements between Telstra, IBM and others over information technology sourcing. It regarded those arrangements as quite untenable. It said that they reflected a part&amp;hyphen;privatisation of Telstra by the then government, which in reality turned out to be quite incorrect. It was simply a better way of Telstra doing business, and the government now has been forced to concede that point. The government has now been forced to allow that to proceed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, that exposes the sham which we saw during the election campaign when that indeed was said to be unacceptable. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), while in opposition during the campaign, ruled out those very measures which they now endorse as appropriate business practice. I think that draws the distinction between the opposition and the government on this matter. We are prepared to support privatisation, commercialisation, where that represents sound public policy and sound ultimate business practice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not the case in the example of Telstra, as members of the government would well know. There are substantial differences
         <break page="710" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          between the sale of Qantas, the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Telstra. I think some of those differences have already been well highlighted. They relate to the market dominance of Telstra which is to be contrasted with the position of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Indeed, while Qantas has some half of the domestic market and a substantial part of the international market, it does not service a very substantial part of the Australian community. I think some five per cent of Australians fly regularly.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While the Commonwealth Bank served a very useful and significant purpose to be publicly owned in the early part of its life cycle, that did not apply at the time the Labor government privatised the Commonwealth Bank. Circumstances had changed dramatically. We used the opportunity of public ownership to create the environment in which the Commonwealth Bank could flourish initially and then, when it was no longer necessary or essential for it to be in public ownership, the opportunity was taken to privatise it. It is, of course, a very important part of our banking fraternity but not a dominant part of it. It is no longer critical to the public ownership test.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But Telstra is quite different. Not only is that the dominant carrier to the extent of some 90 per cent of telecommunications traffic in this country, but it is also in a transition and a deregulation phase. One of the important parts of the Labor government's telecommunications policy over the last decade was to ensure that the telecommunications industry was properly deregulated in a phased and measured way, the public performance standards were there and the service delivery was there but that the benefits of competition flowed through to the public. Telstra, and indeed the whole industry, is still in that transition phase. It is still pre&amp;hyphen;1997. We do not yet have the complete picture of where an open telecommunications industry will take this country. Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and others which will be entering the market shortly are not yet in a mature and settled position in relation to their industry.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          Quite clearly there are many issues still outstanding in that dimension of the deregula tion of the telecommunications industry, issues which are quite properly still to be settled. I understand that the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, has torn up the initial draft post&amp;hyphen;1997 regulatory bill and is starting afresh. That might be his right as a minister, but I think it indicates just where we are in this process. There is still a very long way to go. To impose on the telecommunications industry—and indeed its dominant carrier, Telstra—at this stage in the deregulation process the additional uncertainty which part&amp;hyphen;privatisation will bring, I think is a very negative aspect of the overall approach that this government brings to telecommunications policy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For one thing it completely ignores the vital industry development aspects of the telecommunications industry itself. As a recent Bureau of Industry Economics report indicated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Australia has a long tradition in the manufacturing of TE. Much of this industry originally developed under the protective umbrella of the Postmaster General and later Telecom. A number of firms mentioned in interviews with BIE that Telecom acted as an effective leading&amp;hyphen;edge customer, with stringent technical and quality specifications, stimulating the development of local capabilities. In line with the general industrial restructuring and deregulation of the telecommunications market, this section of the industry is becoming increasingly internationally competitive and export oriented.
        </para>
        <para>
         I think that illustrates very nicely just what role the Postmaster&amp;hyphen;General's Department and ultimately Telecom and Telstra have played in ensuring that Australia has a viable, active and effective telecommunications industry export regime. We have been able to develop a substantial export market under the guidance of Telecom and Telstra to ensure that local firms know exactly where they stand in this market, that they have to meet the highest world best practice standards in the provision of this equipment, and that they have a leading edge purchasing authority to guide them in this very difficult process of becoming world competitive. They have taken on that challenge and they have succeeded.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1983, some 10 or 12 years ago, the industry had very minimal exports of about $50 million a year. However, it is now up to
         <break page="711" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          nearly $1 billion a year and heading beyond that. I think the reality of that transition over the last decade, from $50 million in exports to over $1 billion in exports, is very significant and shows us just what an important role Telstra has played in guiding that industry, which is vital to Australia's future development in this region, through its formative stages.

         To impose privatisation, to impose deregulation, and to impose them both together and therefore remove the industry development and national interest constraints that Telstra has always operated under, will be very damaging to that emerging industry, one which is set to take Australia as part of the overall information technology and telecommunications industries into the year 2000. It has put that very much at risk.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is worth noting that the total IT and telecommunications business in this country will be worth of the order of $10 billion by the year 2000. That prediction is a very substantial one. It shows the magnitude of the combined IT and telecommunications industries, where they have still to go and what potential they have, and this government puts much of that at risk. That is very sad for Australia, very sad for a vital sunrise industry which has contributed so much to our export growth and which has the potential to make this country a leading edge exporter of IT and telecommunications. The government has done that by creating this climate of uncertainty about telecommunications and information technology and, in many ways, for industry in general.

         It has promised to withdraw $1 billion in capital expenditure over the next triennial period.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Meanwhile, question marks hang over important tax concessions, such as the research and development 150 per cent tax concession, which has been vital to establishing our export oriented research and development industries and to ensuring our large domestic base in R&amp;D. The question mark that hangs over that concession—ministers tell us that we will have to wait till 20 August to find out—also creates the kind of uncertainty which the extract I just quoted to the House refers to.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are question marks over the partnerships for development program, fixed term arrangements, the R&amp;D grants which the previous government put in place, and the multi&amp;hyphen;media scheme promoted by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) when he was the minister for communications, and by the former Prime Minister. Those question marks do not ensure a good result for Australian industry, particularly in the vital high&amp;hyphen;tech areas.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The industry also needs to note that this part&amp;hyphen;privatisation is quite possibly the worst of all worlds for it. If this bill makes its way through all stages of the parliament, Telstra will be one&amp;hyphen;third privatised. I suspect that that outcome will be followed only by full privatisation, perhaps in a phased program, perhaps not. The Prime Minister has given a commitment that that will not occur during the life of this parliament. But while I assume that is one commitment that will be honoured—no doubt one of few in the long term—the reality still is that Telstra will be one&amp;hyphen;third privatised, if this bill is successful, for a substantial period of time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That will mean that the government is still in control of two&amp;hyphen;thirds of the company. But governments do not make good majority shareholders. Once you sell one share in Telstra you have effectively turned the company over to the one&amp;hyphen;third private ownership criteria. The private owners are the ones who will really control Telstra. Government, when it is only a majority public shareholder in what is a privately controlled company, is never in a good position to ensure accountability and the development of the national interest. The government will not be in a position to direct the company. It will not be in a position to use its two&amp;hyphen;thirds voting share to oppress the one&amp;hyphen;third minority shareholders. It is the commercial shareholders, including as it will foreign owners, whose interests will predominate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ability to impose checks and balances on that foreign ownership is further diluted by the government's abandonment of the promise to have A and B class shares to ensure that there is an effective manner of holding the overseas shareholders accountable for their prescribed limit in the company. Neither will there be the opportunity for the minister to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          direct the company, nor for national interest to play a very substantial role in the newly privatised Telstra.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Why should foreign owners allow Telstra to continue to provide development assistance to Australian start&amp;hyphen;up companies? In many cases those shareholders might be competitors of Telstra. They might be overseas interests with conflicting requirements for Telstra when it comes to exports to the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific areas, to India, and to other overseas developing markets. They will be almost certainly exerting pressure on Telstra to source its suppliers from elsewhere.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why would Telstra continue to buy products in the Australian market when it can buy them cheaper from overseas on the back end of an AT&amp;T, British Telecom, Sprint, Mercury or MCI contract? All of those things will be out there in the global marketplace. Why should Telstra continue to focus on the best practice in the Australian market when those other pressures will be very firmly exerted by the board of Telstra and the private shareholders' representatives on that board? That is the harsh reality of a one&amp;hyphen;third privatised Telstra. It is neither public nor private. It suffers from the worst constraints of both. To impose this change on the industry and on that particular company during a period of deregulation is perhaps the worst possible outcome in that regard.

The rural areas, the backbone of our agricultural and primary resources industries, were very keen on the prospect of having ISDN services available at their front door or at the farm gate, as the case may be. But that is a very expensive promise. I am not certain that a newly privatised Telstra would want to endorse that promise and fulfil it. The test will be when the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is put to this House.

         I ask them to also examine this question: is this, in reality, the technology which they want to take rural Australia and outer metropolitan Australia into the next century with? The reality is that ISDN was very important in this country 10 years ago; it was leading edge technology then. Is it still leading edge technology? Certainly not. The reality is that to be at the leading edge in the next century you will need broadband services at your door and you will need the optical fibre with a capacity of an order of magnitude greater than ISDN can deliver.

The reality is that it was a good leading edge service some years ago. Telstra did not pursue that service in the way which I personally think that it should have; but the reality is that ISDN is moving past its prime and will be a very ordinary service over the next few years and that people will really be

The government has been concerned enough to enable the debate to go on so that all those members on both sides of the chamber who wished to speak have had the opportunity to do so. I have just received the five amendments provided by the shadow minister for competition policy, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), in addition to his second reading amendment. I am not sure how you wish to proceed, but maybe you could seek leave to treat the amendments as a whole. That will still enable you to speak to each particular one.

         I want to take the opportunity to sum up. I do not think I will be able to do justice to all the speakers in this period, but I will do the best I can. I want to thank everyone for their contribution. However, the government is disappointed that the opposition has taken a clearly ideological position in its opposition to the bill and its refusal to concede that the government has put forward legislation addressing the key issues which the opposition says concerns it—in particular, the consumer safeguards and ensuring that Telstra remains owned and controlled by Australians. That is clearly in the bill. This is a partial dilution of the capital of Telstra—one-third—and the bill requires a continued two-thirds of Telstra to be controlled by the government. There are a range of consumer safeguards building on the safeguards that are already there.

But I would like to give a response to some of the substantive issues that were raised. Many of the issues raised by the opposition are not related to the government's shareholder relationship with Telstra but are regulatory issues that apply to all telecommunications carriers, and that is best dealt with in other debates.

          I want to turn now to some particular issues. Universal service obligations issues were raised in nearly every contribution by the opposition. The claim has broadly been made that there is a watering down of the universal service obligation, which is an obligation in legislation that you equalise the cost of calls across the nation because the new section in the Telstra Corporation Act—8CM—refers to the universal service obliga tion being fulfilled `as economically and efficiently as practicable'.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact, the provision in the bill that has been referred to by the opposition is identical to the policy objectives spelt out in paragraph 287(1)(b) of the existing Telecommunications Act, which was passed in this place in 1991 with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as the then minister for communications and me, ironically, as the opposition spokesman on communications. We both agreed that that was an eminently sensible piece of legislation, at that stage, in relation to that particular clause and that clause is preserved in this piece of legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The existing provisions will be strengthened by reaffirming in the Telstra act that the universal service obligation is not affected by the dilution of public ownership in Telstra. The current provision in section 287 of the act that provides for the universal service obligation to be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable—it has been there since 1991, as I say—simply makes it clear that there is no room for complacency in exploring better ways to deliver telecommunications services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Indeed, the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), was thoughtful in terms of the assessment of the technologies—the very point this section enables us to pursue—in that there are emerging technologies which make it possible to deliver these services with even greater efficiency and with price benefits for consumers. We want to make sure that the act is drawn in such a way as to have that flexibility to pursue that broader principle of USO.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill does not limit the operation of the universal service obligation in any way. Section 288 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 will continue to guarantee reasonable access by all Australians to the standard telephone service. The government is also to commence a review to examine whether the definition of the standard telephone service should be upgraded. Many of us who follow these issues know that that would be a very timely review.
        </para>
        <break page="715" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The further claim has been made that with Telstra in partial private ownership the USO will not be able to be delivered over time. That is simply not true. The government is committed to universal service and carriers are and will continue to be required to provide and fund universal service obligations.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It has also been alleged and suggested that privatisation will lead to an increase in cost for telephone connections and calls. There was a rollcall of electorates for which relevant costs were cited. That was tried during the election campaign without success. Clearly, it is designed to generate some angst amongst rural and regional communities. It was not accepted during the election campaign. It will not be accepted now. This legislation establishes the USO. So that sort of approach by the opposition is clearly inappropriate. There is absolutely no validity at all in any of the comments made by so many of the opposition members on that particular point.

          I also make the point that I represent a regional electorate. Flinders Island is in the middle of it. A colleague on the other side and I joined many years ago on one of the reports that we did. I can assure him and all members of the House that this government would not be involved in establishing policies which would in any way disadvantage or inhibit the spread of technology to benefit regional and remote communities. This bill, which we hope will become an act, will ensure that. In fact, the reverse will be true.

           —Temporarily anyway. Together with the greater competition which this government will introduce from July 1997, partial privatisation will make Telstra more efficient and responsive to consumers resulting in lower prices and more innovative services utilising the march in technologies that are becoming increasingly available.

          In addition to the government's commitment to universal service, the government is retaining price controls on Telstra. Interestingly, I do not think one member of the opposition mentioned this fact. They chose to ignore it. The government is retaining price controls on Telstra, which means that for each of the years until 31 December 1998, Telstra must reduce its prices for a basket of services, including local calls, STD calls, international calls and rentals, in real terms by 7.5 per cent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Prices for individual services to residential customers must also reduce in real terms by one per cent. Local call prices, which are currently 25c—I would take the view that they are overpriced now, that the real cost is somewhere in the vicinity of 15c—and public pay phone prices, which are currently 40c, are not permitted to increase in nominal terms prior to 31 December 1998. With Optus entering the local call market in coming months, local call prices would be expected to fall.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Remember that the opposition, the then government, introduced competition directly claiming at the time, in most cases accurately as it now transpires, that competition would see a decline in prices, particularly when you have the price controls in the CPI minus X formula. That has worked and we are continuing that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The opposition has also argued that removal of the minister's power of direction will take away the power of the government to control Telstra and to enforce the universal service obligation. A ministerial power of direction over a partially privatised Telstra would be overly intrusive and incongruous with moving Telstra into a more commercial framework. The bill provides the Commonwealth as a majority shareholder with appropriate access to information. This is enshrined in legislation to ensure that Telstra is accountable to the minister and therefore the parliament.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is important to note that the ministerial power of direction has been in the act since 1991. But guess what? Not once since 1991 has the ministerial power been exercised. So why all the angst that has been exercised by
          <break page="716" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           the opposition over the last three days about the removal of this power as we take the inevitable forward step, the sensible step, towards not only greater competition but also the inclusion of the possibility of private shareholding in this entity? So this power has never been used.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government is not about interfering in the day-to-day running of Telstra. It is concerned with strategic oversight. This is no different from the policy of the previous government in relation to Telstra. The former minister spoke about this area. I think he went halfway down this path but did not recognise that the role he had as minister was to have strategic oversight and not to be involved in the day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day running of Telstra. He never once exercised the ministerial power that he had, which was put in the act by the Leader of the Opposition back in 1991. In addition, the ministerial power of directions is not needed to enforce the universal service obligation. That is enforced through the Telecommunications Act and by Austel, the government regulator.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A related argument raised by the opposition is that the Telstra board will be required under the Corporations Law to run the company for the benefit of minority shareholders. The Commonwealth will exercise control of Telstra in the same way as any other majority shareholder of a Corporations Law company. It will be able to outvote other shareholders on every issue that arises at a general meeting. It will appoint two-thirds of the Telstra board. Private shareholders in Telstra will not be placed in a privileged position through the operation of the Corporations Law. The oppression rules in the Corporations Law simply ensure that minority shareholders are treated fairly.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another concern raised by the opposition is that there will be staff reductions in Telstra as a result of privatisation. Telstra needs to strive to achieve world best practice throughout its business. It is the role of the board and management, not government, to determine strategies to achieve this objective. Any reduction in staff numbers within Telstra will be dependent on factors such as market or commercial pressures, increased competition
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           and the desire to achieve world best practice. These factors already affect the business operations of the company and will continue to apply, whether or not Telstra remains in full public ownership. That has been made clear by the managing director, as I understand it.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Telstra is already aware that there will be greater competition post&amp;hyphen;1997, regardless of what form that might finally take. In order for Telstra to position itself for competition in the post&amp;hyphen;1997 environment and to achieve world best practice, one of the key management challenges over the coming years will be the improvement of work force productivity levels. The stimulus provided by private shareholdings is likely to spur the company to perform better and to grow domestically and internationally. A competitive and growing company will provide better continuing employment prospects.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It might be worth noting that there are now 73,000-odd employees in Telstra—about a 7.5 per cent increase in numbers for the six months to December. Also, alarmingly, what we have seen in the recent results is that, whilst there is $7.43 billion Australian sales revenue, the earnings before interest and tax were increased by only 4.7 per cent rather than the 9.7 per cent on sales revenue, but operating expenses were up by 10.4 per cent.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If you take the point that I was making earlier about the actual cost of prices, that has to be an area of concern, particularly for companies such as this. I think it was the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) who made the point in some of the statistics he quoted that the market share of Telstra is under squeeze because of competition. So it does mean that this company has to be strategically placed to not only meet its capex requirements to engage new technologies but also position itself to meet the competitive pressures that are increasingly going to respond in the market by the Optuses and Vodafones—the most liberal resale activity we have anywhere in the world, which was introduced by you in 1991. So I think you have to recognise what is happening here. Therefore, the opportunities for staff—

           In relation to industry issues, what about the opposition's claim that the Australian industry will lose out as a partially privatised Telstra will reduce its commitment to local industry?

He has chosen, as I said, right at the outset to try to have a differentiation between the opposition and the government, and he has reverted back to where the government was prior to 1991. I think that is particularly regrettable.

           In terms of what the opposition leader had to say yesterday, he is condemned by his own arguments. I do not have the exact quote but, in summary, he said that imposing a specific local content condition on Telstra would be likely to be inconsistent with the government's obligations under the GATT arrangements. So there is a recognition—

In fact, the answer is that the bill does provide this option.

           With regard to the 1997 regulations, suggestion has been made that the government cannot sell part of Telstra because the post-1997 competitive regime will not be in place. The government is committed to having a place on an open competitive environment prior to the partial sale and, as the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) recently indicated, the government is aiming to have post-1997 legislation in place by the end of 1996. You will have a chance to discuss those issues then. I will deal with your ISDN issue. If you are going to move your amendment on that point, I will deal with it then.

           There are a couple of other points I want to make finally. That is, there has been a passing parade of people involved in these issues since I have been involved since 1984, but two of the notable exceptions from the people who spoke during this debate were former telecommunications ministers, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) and the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). I found it rather interesting that particularly Mr Willis, the former Treasurer, did not speak on this matter because there did not seem to be in the contribution to the debate any assessment of the overall economic impact. Indeed, it was surprising that the member for Holt did not

           There is a continued commitment from the government to underpinning the changes that are proposed in this act, with a strong commitment to the enhancement of consumer safeguards and the maintenance of the USO issue. USO is a fundamental issue for this government. It has been enunciated in the act carefully. The issue with regard to foreign ownership has been spelled out very carefully in the legislation. There was not a lot of discussion about it during the debate—there were 40-odd speakers—but it has been dealt with very carefully. Also in this legislation is the development of a broad, flexible sale scheme, subject to the results of a scoping study. This matter will move from this House, after consideration of the opposition's amendments, to the Senate.

           There is, of course, the broader issue of the environment, which was briefly discussed by some members of the opposition and certainly by government members, who recognise the strong and vital role of the environment and the need to upgrade it and to look to a positive financial input into the upgrading of the environment. The proposed Natural Heritage Trust, a result of the sale of one-third of Telstra, will give the capacity for a very historic decision—if it is going to be accepted by the parliament—to enhance the environment in this country. I commend the bill to the House.

           I am advised that the quickest possible time frame in which this can be achieved is being pursued, and it is a matter of priority for the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Senator Alston was shadow minister in this area right up to 1993. He was also spokesman for communications in the Senate. Over the last little period, he was shadow minister, and now he is minister.

           A higher priority for the government is the maintenance of the minimum standard of universal service in telecommunications. As I said, we are subjecting that to review. It is a priority which is reflected in the bill's provisions reaffirming that universal service obligation. I hope that with this small extension of time I am able to address that issue now and will not need to address it when the opposition formally moves its amendment on this matter.

        This is an amendment to keep the government honest. This is an amendment to keep the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), honest in the light of his election commitment to provide the ISDN fast data link throughout Australia by 1 July 1997. This was a clear commitment provided by the Prime Minister to the National Farmers Federation and, we understand, the key commitment by which the National Party agreed to the privatisation of Telstra.

        Every National Party member in this place should be seriously concerned that the government is backing away from its commitment on the ISDN and that it has not made the ISDN provision an integral part of this legislation. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister gave that commitment to the National Farmers Federation. In his speech of 21 November last year the member for Bennelong said:

        It was that commitment to the bush that seduced the National Party into agreeing to the privatisation of Telstra. It was that commitment to regional Australia that convinced members of the National Party that they should be supporting the privatisation of this major public asset. I would have thought that, if every National Party member in this House is a good representative of their constituents, they would support this Labor Party amendment. They will keep the Prime Minister honest. They will keep this government honest. They will fulfil their most important commitment to rural Australia—that is, to allow schools in the bush, to allow community organisations in the bush and to allow small businesses, farmers and families in the bush to have the sort of on&amp;hyphen;line services and

        There is a suggestion around the parliament that the Expenditure Review Committee is adopting an unusual approach to election promises. If it has a dollar sign next to it—that is, if it was costed in the coalition election costings—it is something they are going to try to fulfil come budget night. Apparently, if it does not have a dollar sign next to it, it is being regarded as a category B promise—that is, a promise made only to be broken.

        This clause was a promise made by the Prime Minister to seduce the National Party into supporting the privatisation of Telstra. Come election night, he found that he did not need the National Party because the Liberal Party had a majority in this House in its own right. The National Party has been dumped. The promise has been forgotten. The ERC has it under category B—promises made only to be broken—and rural and regional Australia has been forgotten.

        We are interested in keeping them honest on this commitment. Part (b) of the amendment that has been circulated calls on the government to ensure that schedule 1 does not commence until the telecommunications regulations review is complete and enacted. I am happy to address that in another five&amp;hyphen;minute contribution shortly.

        The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) convinced the National Farmers Federation and the National Party members to allow the privatisation of Telstra by way of a promise he made in a speech to the National Farmers Federation on 21 November last year. Up until half an hour ago, that promise was still valid. The member for Bass, the minister at the table, was the one who announced to the parliament and to the people of Australia that John Howard was walking away from the promise that got the National Party to agree to the sale of Telstra. On 21 November the Prime Minister made a promise right throughout rural Australia. He said:

       <para>
        That was the promise from 21 November until half an hour ago. Half an hour ago the minister at the table did not say, `Wherever you live, if you are connected to a digital exchange you get the high&amp;hyphen;speed ISDN data links.' He said simply that, under the Liberal Party, Telstra would try to achieve that as soon as possible. From November until half an hour ago the promise was to achieve it by 1 July 1997, accelerate the investment program and bring it forward from the year 2000.

        We know why you are trying to walk away from it. It is because it will cost an absolute fortune. It was a ridiculous promise. It was a promise that means that Telstra will have to accelerate its capital investment program. Telstra estimates that it will cost at least $1.4 billion to bring forward that capital investment. In addition, you have no idea as to how many people will want to take up ISDN. Even if only one in four people in the bush take up ISDN, it will cost $4 billion. That was the promise that the Prime Minister made to the National Farmers Federation—a multibillion dollar promise that was active from 21 November until about half past 11 today.

You have now told them that they will not have access by 1 July 1997; they will have access only as soon as possible. It is not good enough. We are going to make sure that you are put under pressure to keep the promises you made at the last election, and we are going to make sure that you provide those high&amp;hyphen;speed data links to people wherever they may live.

In honouring this commitment to ISDN, to what extent would a conflict be resolved if it would cause undue financial pressure, presumably because of the added competition that is forecast in 1997, on the financial viability of the company? As far as I am concerned, the proposal that everyone should have access—

         —The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) pointed out that it will be a huge financial commitment for Telstra to fulfil the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I do not think that is being debated by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), at the table. I have asked, in relation to the directors and their fiduciary responsibility, whether the minister could explain the government's prime responsibility if a conflict arose with the financial viability of the organisation. Is it their responsibility to honour this commitment or their commitment to the shareholders? Secondly, if there is a conflict in implementing this commitment in the absence of ministerial direction, what is the position of the directors?

         —I too rise in support of the amendment to the Telstra bill put forward by the opposition. I do agree with the member for Chifley (Mr Price). I took some notes when the debate was being handled by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith). At no time did he refer to what was going to happen with ministerial control after this bill has gone through the House. At no time did he give a guarantee that an instruction would be provided by the government as to what was to be achieved and when the ISDN fast data link would be happening.

        As the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has brought to the attention of the House, we now finally know that it will no longer be the date that was given in a commitment by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Taking it out of his own mouth, the minister at the table, the honourable member for Bass, in reply, stated very clearly and very succinctly that it would be as soon as possible. Under whose direction will it be as soon as possible? Obviously, when you read the bill, it will not be at the direction of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) because the minister has no power whatsoever to direct the directors once this bill becomes law.

        One area which is of concern to me is that, there being no commitment now being provided by the government to having no ministerial direction of the ISDN, one has only to look to other parts of the world to see what has happened when telecommunications systems have been privatised. We can now proudly say that, because 90 per cent of our telecommunications is owned by the government, we cover something like 97 per cent of our country. In Britain, massive staff cuts occurred during their privatisation and now, if you look at the access of services, something like 10 per cent of that country is not covered with access to telecommunications.

        My remarks were certainly in reference to that. My remarks were also in reference to the fact that when you privatise a telecommunications system you have no guarantees of delivery. Rightly so, you have a board of directors responsible to shareholders and you have shareholders who have invested to make a profit.

        Five Independents will figure in that debate. According to my research, that is the greatest number of non&amp;hyphen;aligned Independents elected to one parliament since Federation.

        I have heard encouraging words in recent days about a commitment to a better, fairer and more democratic parliament than has occurred in recent history. I believe the electorate has also spoken firmly on this issue in the recent election. Rather than a ringing endorsement of the policies of the new government, the electorate rejected a Labor

        In a world that is becoming more confusing, more threatening, far more violent and less personal by the day, people need leadership from politicians who will hear their calls regardless of the political implications. Such a test of our resolve to create a more caring, less violent Australia must surely be a unanimous commitment to uniform gun laws when police ministers meet tomorrow in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre. And anticipating less than unanimous support from the states, I call too for an early referendum to test whether Australians want the Commonwealth to take control of gun supply and ownership—and the making and distribution of violent videos. Despite some academic claims to the contrary, my extensive media background suggests that brutal behaviour and the video pornography of violence are closely linked.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Lest one side or the other in this place believes it has a mortgage on commonsense, might I warn that the traditional role of parties in Australian politics is under strong challenge. There is a growing awareness in the electorate that honest, effective representation of constituents' interests can be achieved through channels other than political parties. Inflexible ideology on either side will bring swift retribution. People want fair and reasonable government, no domination by one school of thought whether it be union or rationalist economics. People expect government participation and support in their lives, as much as they respect the value of private enterprise for fair return, provided it both rewards the entrepreneur and is beneficial to the common wealth.

        That brings me to some of the issues of national importance relevant to my area of central western New South Wales, issues involving both private and government responsibilities that I propose to pursue during this parliamentary term. Calare is a rural division extending from Oberon in the south-east, to Yeoval in the north&amp;hyphen;west, to Eugowra
        <break page="734" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in the south&amp;hyphen;west and to tiny Bylong in the north-east. It was at Bylong a week or so ago where I gladly lost some money for local charity on several long priced entrants in the annual mouse races, surely the epitome of rural ingenuity.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Calare contains the local government areas of Lithgow, Oberon, Rylstone, Bathurst, Blayney, Evans, Cabonne and parts of Wellington, with major industries including education, timber, mining, cement, wool top making, whitegoods, food and pet food manufacturing, tourism to a veritable gold mine of attractions and, of course, farming, especially fruit growing and grazing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, the viability of much of this industry is under threat from short-sighted economic policies. Of grave concern is the breakdown of infrastructure in the regions. Unless national governments inject capital into regional Australia or offer greater incentives for private capital to take a larger role in the regions then the smaller towns, and the larger centres, are at grave risk of further economic decline.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We need to inject far more into local government by way of untied grants for projects that are crucial to small and large communities. By that I mean projects such as the Eugowra sewerage augmentation scheme where a struggling and ageing rural community cannot sustain even the most basic of infrastructure, rights that most Australians take for granted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While mining is a seductive job deliverer to a depressed rural economy, we must not assume that quarrying our resources is the only key to regional development. We must measure the long-term benefits and retain and strengthen a federal environment review process to oversee all mining or resource extraction that makes a significant impact on the national environment. I do not believe the parochial interests of state governments, and particularly local governments, are far enough removed from such projects to enable objective assessment.

         in country areas like Orange where public sector jobs have been slashed without regard for the type of service delivered by those former public servants. In this case in Orange it was state agriculture department staff. Those people provide an essential service for the economic wellbeing of farmer clients. Nor does it take into account the money those forgone salaries inject into the local economy.

        At a federal level we see the planned removal of the Australian Taxation Office from regional centres, ostensibly because a more cost efficient, electronic service is available. This is the brave new world of public service where the elderly, the computer illiterate, the struggling business operator, the farmer, the tax student and the tax agent are all expected to seek advice via a toll-free line. This has nothing to do with public service, it has much to do with ignoring the real requirements of regional Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the service infrastructure under threat. On the other hand, we see the deliberate dismantling of publicly owned concrete infrastructure. With the demise of the New South Wales branch rail system over the past decade, the western rail line from Sydney to Broken Hill is a national asset which is now under grave threat. For years the responsibility for the line has been buck&amp;hyphen;passed between federal and state governments, and downgraded to the extent that it is now a disincentive to private users. Meanwhile, the multibillion dollar trucking business has grown on the back of this neglect of rail, causing massive road damage to systems not designed for the size or frequency of such heavy freight cartage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The more enlightened trucking operators want to integrate road and rail operations, and movers of bulk materials, such as CSR Oberon, tell me that it would be far more cost efficient to transport export products straight to the wharves by rail. The government is reluctant to meet the commercial users halfway by guaranteeing fair access to the rail network.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, the madness of this approach dictates that the community service obligations of governments are virtually eliminated. Nowhere are the costs of trucks on roads—or
        <break page="735" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the absence of trains on tracks carrying bulk and hazardous freight—factored into the bottom line. Can we afford not to maintain the existing national rail network in this country? Indeed, can we afford not to expand it, thus maintaining rail and freight jobs in regional centres along the way? Unless the Commonwealth government re&amp;hyphen;enters the infrastructure business, this country will never develop to its full potential, and most of that potential lies in regional Australia in areas like Calare.

        A substantial re&amp;hyphen;regulation of the financial system is required to ensure that essential capital flows into the public sector to serve the public good. Private lending institutions create credit for private, often unproductive, profit—credit that is also responsible for importation of consumer goods at the expense of local jobs. We should restore parliament's right to create national credit for national projects which become part of the nation's wealth as assets.

        We should also tax foreign exchange transactions and legislate to access the $60 billion of Australian superannuation funds that should be helping to develop this country, and not being invested offshore. Private enterprise will be a partner in developing regional Australia if the infrastructure is in place. I am not talking about 150 per cent tax write&amp;hyphen;offs for investors in vineyard projects. I am talking about public credit like government bonds created to maintain income, positive infrastructure such as our transcontinental rail links or a nationally funded Great Western&amp;hyphen;Mid Western Highway with rail&amp;hyphen;road container interchanges, or a Parkes inland freight airport. I notice that the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) is in the chamber. I appreciate his presence. This latter project, while outside my electorate, will have a huge impact on industry in our area, and is of major national importance. Yet this scheme may also be killed off by the economic rationalists before it gets off the ground.

        From the briefings I have had with the Inland Marketing Corporation, which is overseeing and promoting this regional agricultural development project, I believe it is a national value&amp;hyphen;adding asset without peer. It

Many hundreds of jobs—potentially thousands—could be generated by this multifaceted agricultural project that would ensure we became a reliable supplier of the cleanest, freshest and greenest foodstuffs to those emerging tiger economies to the north, and beyond in Europe.

        I can foresee an extension of this project to an international passenger airport, revitalising the regional airline industry, and complemented by a very fast train from Parkes to Sydney. It is an airport complex which most in western New South Wales really want, believe it or not. Why throw billions at an airport in western Sydney that few want? Let us become creative and, I believe, truly economically rational by developing our transport infrastructure to meet the requirements of the new century and, at the same time, help regenerate regional Australia, from which our agricultural and mineral wealth is derived. We cannot leave the regions to the forces of the level playing field.

        We once had a manufacturing base like ADI at Lithgow that involved many of these people in the work force as process workers and doing the manual jobs. Where have they gone? We cannot retrain most of the older displaced workers. There is nothing for the young who are not clever or lucky except a series of work skills programs. We have a national youth unemployment rate around 30 per cent, if you can believe the figures, and an overall unemployment rate officially about eight per cent and sure to go up. The figures are almost the same as they were when the coalition handed over the reins of government to Labor in 1983. Whatever the job creation in that time, it has not provided for the not&amp;hyphen;so&amp;hyphen;clever who are the victims of the modern competition at all costs, economic rationalism, survival of the fittest regime.

        If we do not devise ways of providing meaningful employment for these people, we are socially doomed. We cannot bemoan the anti&amp;hyphen;social behaviour of those whose own society and economic system cannot provide them with a job or a life beyond mindless videos. We have a rampant cancer in our society. The inability to provide gainful employment for our young is a major cause. We need to be far more creative in our work programs. We need to provide not 26&amp;hyphen;week work skilling, but perhaps three&amp;hyphen;year long, two days a week commitments.

It is soul destroying. I have heard from some of these people. They wish they had never started—rather than to have experienced the team work, to have part completed the job and then to be abandoned. Unless we review our economic policies, we will never again approach full employment. There are at least one million people in this country who want to work and who cannot. Surely there is something wrong with the system that created this. Young people in particular with no real prospects of productive employment not only bitterly resent the society that cannot share its wealth with them but also are being constantly bombarded by media messages telling them how successful they should be. There are only winners. Anger sets in, and if you happen to be black in this country, particularly in regional Australia, your race marginalises you even further.

If we are serious about constitutional reform, let us look seriously at the costs caused by the duplication—and duplicity—of the states. Stronger regional government with roughly equal populations to administer and an equal share of the federal tax take is the only logical way we should go in any constitutional reform. The current republic debate is a furphy, given the substantial reforms needed to really make us nationally cooperative and economically efficient. Such reform would even out opportunity and bring government closer to the people, making it so much more accountable. It would enable us to focus on a cooperative national goal rather than state of origin footie matches. As we develop new national infrastructure, funded by national credit and not debt to foreign interests, let us also hold on to the remaining shareholding of the publicly owned assets we now retain.

         —I speak this afternoon representing the electors of Lindsay, who for the first time since the seat was created in 1983 have elected a Liberal representative. On 2 March 1996, in a landslide swing, I caught up a difference of 16,500 votes and was duly elected to parliament. I stand here today as the living testimonial of the mass defection of the true believers from a party that had become hidebound, unresponsive, unsympathetic, unrepresentative and too busy playing political football to listen to the ordinary battler.

        Lindsay is full of ordinary battlers: PAYE taxpayers, paying off a mortgage, who are concerned about interest rates; people who are concerned about providing for their old age; people who want to give their children more than they had themselves; people who are working so hard and still not getting ahead. That was the recurring complaint I heard everywhere on the campaign trail, from families trying to raise three kids on a single income; from families trying to raise kids on two incomes; from people with their own business, trade or shop; from people employing others. They were saying, `I am working so hard and I just don't seem to be able to get ahead.' And that is odd, because throughout our proud history Australians have always given the next generation a better deal than
        <break page="738" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The people of Lindsay did not make a mistake on 2 March. They voted to have their representative in government, not in opposition. The area has traditionally reflected the political tide of the times. The most renowned of the previous representatives for this area in federal parliament was Labor's icon, Ben Chifley. The Labor Party that lost on 2 March was not his party and it did not represent his people. Others who have represented this area include Reg Gillard and Tony Luchetti, both true representatives of the people who worked hard for them, and my immediate predecessor, Ross Free.

        The people of Lindsay traditionally prefer their representatives in power where they can be effective rather than in opposition where the Labor Party was doomed to be after 2 March.

        Looking around the chamber at this 1996 government of John Howard, it is truly the broad church he has been striving to create. John Howard's government has more female members of parliament than any other government in the history of this country. We have the first Greek born member elected to parliament, the first Maltese born member elected to parliament and the youngest parliamentarian ever. We have more Catholics than ever before, and all this from a party which had the first female MP, the first Aboriginal senator, the first senator from a non&amp;hyphen;English speaking background and is soon to have the first physically disabled senator.

Let us not be afraid of the pace of these changes either because the technology and information available today mean that change will only happen with increasing speed in the future, and the people of Lindsay want a young government that knows where the information superhighway is going, because unless you know where you are going then it is pretty hard to plan to be there and you become the victim of progress and not the master of it.

         The people of Lindsay thought very hard about the decision they made on 2 March. They know tough times are ahead; they know you cannot spend more than you earn. They live within their means and they expect governments to do the same because in the end it is their money that governments are spending. They know that the last government was spending more than it earned for the last six consecutive budgets. In fact, in the three years prior to the 2 March election, it was sneakily increasing the revenue raised from sales tax by 40 per cent. This meant that the ordinary battlers, such as the people of Lindsay, in spending their hard&amp;hyphen;earned cash had to fund the previous government's overspending.

         The people of Lindsay voted knowing full well that the new government would not introduce any sneaky revenue&amp;hyphen;raising schemes but would sensibly live within its means and go on being tough—and the going is going to be tough—bearing in mind that there is a $100 billion Commonwealth debt to service. It is going to be tough, but when the going gets tough, the tough get going.

There is the danger of getting too used to the Comcars, the room service, the flash offices, the guttered roads and all the mod cons that insulate you from the failing small businesses, unemployment, bankruptcy, soup kitchens and the despair and depression of our youth. But eventually you must go back to the real world. If you have not looked after your real world in your electorate as you should have, then this prospect may frighten you. I know I was frightened in 1993 when I returned to western Sydney after three years in the armed forces in Asia.

         Since the 1700s people have been coming here to carve out a new life for themselves and they have succeeded. The early immigrants settling around Parramatta brought with them hope for a new life for their children and for the opportunity of a better living standard. They gradually moved west across the Cumberland plain to the imposing escarpment of the lower Blue Mountains and by 1813 Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth had found their way across the escarpment with the help of local Aboriginals. Whilst the immigration to this country has developed it to one of the leading nations in this region, we must not forget our responsibility to the indigenous people, something which the previous government gave a lot of rhetoric to but in fact did very little about.

For a rower it is obviously one of the world&amp;hyphen;class sites for training and it is one of the few venues chosen outside of Homebush for the Olympic Games. For a water skier, a jet skier, a kayaker or a fisherman, it is truly one of the most magic spots on this earth. The air always gets better out there as you come out of the Sydney smog. It is a great place to live. It has a great lifestyle and a very rustic, rural atmosphere. It has many historic sites from the early settlers. It also has magnificent shopping and is only an hour to the flash and dash of Sydney and only a short way further to the beaches. On the other hand, within an hour you can get up to Katoomba and the Three Sisters for some of the most magnificent bushwalks in Australia and some of the most magnificent environmental national parks this country has created.

        This is the first of a series of motions to establish the committees of the parliament. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to do so this afternoon. As a matter of logistics, the debate will be interrupted by question time. We hope to conclude the debate today so that the committees can be established and commence their very important work.

        I am a bit disappointed that the opposition, who talk about parliamentary standards, have reverted to their previous attitude to the parliament. I am disappointed that we could not come to some sensible arrangement about the parliament's affairs today, which we had intended to do. That is a pity. Leaving that aside, the proposed change to standing order 28B will have several effects. Several of the standing committees have been retitled to reflect areas of current emphasis and concern. For example, the banking, finance and public administration committee will become the financial institutions and public administration committee; the community affairs committee becomes the family and community affairs committee; and the transport, communications
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and infrastructure committee becomes the communications, transport and microeconomic reform committee.

        A general purpose standing committee will be created to cover primary industries, resources and rural and regional affairs. This committee will cover major portfolio areas which until now have been within the responsibilities of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Its creation will reflect the importance the House attaches to these areas of great national significance and, since the election, the very large number of members, particularly from our side of the House, who represent regional Australia. The government does place very great importance on ensuring that members have the opportunity to actively participate in government and to provide the best possible representation for rural and regional Australia.

        The membership of the standing committees will be increased to 14 with a ratio of nine government to five non&amp;hyphen;government members to reflect the proportion of government to non&amp;hyphen;government members in the House. On the advice that I have, this simply follows the conventional arrangements. I have no doubt that we will hear more from the other side about how draconian and dreadful this is. The truth of the matter is that these proportions reflect the election result. People voted for this side and the consequence of that is reflected in the committee structure. We look forward to your mathematical calculations but on any fair reading of it that is appropriate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The quorum of a standing committee will be reduced from six to three. This reflects the quorum of the House itself, which is 20 per cent, and the provisions elsewhere in the standing orders for quorums of three members—including in the Main Committee. As a consequence of this change, a quorum of a subcommittee would be set at two members rather than being a majority of members of a subcommittee. For those who have taken an interest in committee work—maybe some on the other side have not—this is a practical measure which, outside the House, most would probably agree was sensible.

        The general provisions are amended by removing the word `statutory' from the

         present provision that annual reports of government departments and statutory authorities tabled in the House shall stand referred to the relevant committee for any inquiry the committee may wish to make. By removing that word `statutory' we will open up for potential scrutiny a larger range of government funded agencies or authorities which are not established by statute. This will facilitate a broader oversight of the range of government activities and expenditure by the general purpose standing committees. I think that is a good move.

        My most recent experience on a parliamentary committee was on the banking committee, which was a very good committee. It has done a lot of good work. It has looked at charges set by banks for their commercial and general customers. That is an issue of great interest to the population at large because they have to deal with banks. That committee has done a good job. In its work, that committee has actually picked up on paragraph (b), which allows for the committees to look at annual reports. That committee has looked very closely also at monetary policy and invited the Governor of the Reserve Bank to attend its meetings from time to time. That is a very good thing and it allows the members to put aside the theatrics of the House of Representatives and actually sit down and do some constructive work in the interests of their constituents.

        In that regard, and in respect of monetary policy, interest rates are a real problem in the Australian economy and they have been for 13 years. The previous administration failed to introduce policies to get interest rates down. Australia has very high real interest rates compared with most of our competitors. These committees provide a very good opportunity for members to make a sensible contribution—unlike those from the other side.

        More generally, the government considers the committee process and structure very important indeed. In 1987, following a paper from the then clerk, the parliament established a better arrangement for committees. That paper was endorsed by both sides of politics, and the committees do play a very important role. It gives people the opportunity to make
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         a constructive contribution as members. Also, by holding hearings and the like it gives the public another opportunity to speak to the parliament and to express their point of view.

        Committees also have a very important role in scrutinising the activities of government. Over the years, there have been some many famous and controversial cases where committees have been digging deep, reading the fine print and bringing matters to public exposure. Whilst that is sometimes embarrassing for governments, it is a very good thing for the parliament as a whole. It is part of the general supervisory role that the parliament should undertake.

The sad fact of the matter is that the previous administration left us with an $8 billion black hole, and we have to deal with it. They will complain, whine and whinge and say what they will say, but the truth of the matter is that these issues are going to have to be grappled with. We do so because we know that if we could get the government's finances in better order that would be very good for small business and for Australian families and would give them some relief from the incompetent economic policies of the former minister for finance who now finds himself as Leader of the Opposition.

The cost was going to be enormous to industry as a whole and the attempt to administer it would have been entirely lost. The Treasurer made the point as it related to certain items. Can I just extend the areas, because I notice that the shadow spokesman for industry was talking about toys yesterday. It is quite something to talk about. If toys were brought in under your scheme, they would not have paid nothing at all, as you say, in that respect. Under our scheme, it would be subject to three per cent. But the judgment has to be made whether it would have been a business input or a consumer item under your scheme. So you have the administrative impossibility of trying to put it together.

        The major reason for that confidence is that this was a government which would come clean in announcing the state of the Australian accounts. As far as markets are concerned, it is integral that there be transparency and that there be accuracy in relation to the

         position. Announcing after the election victory on 2 March the true state of Australia's financial state, and announcing a program to go about fixing it, was very important to this government and to the Australian economy in developing confidence in the financial markets. The improved confidence results from the government announcements of fiscal consolidation. Of course, if the opposition had had its way, these figures would not have been disclosed. They would not have been disclosed to the financial markets and they would not have been disclosed to the Australian people.

How do you justify such an assertion in light of the minute by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service of 2 May in which he attributes the 440 job losses in the Australian Customs Service to proposals explicitly outlined in your `Meeting our commitments' document—namely, the two per cent efficiency dividend, the reductions to information technology and consultancies and the $50 million over three years specific to Customs identified on page 13 of your pre-election document?

I inform the House that when Labor was in government between 1986 and 1989 they cut almost 12,000 people from the Australian Public Service. The mistake they made is that they failed to lock in the gains. They let it blow out again. In the two years to June 1995 they cut the numbers again. Obviously, they were in a bit of difficulty at this point and they were trying to get some sort of credibility going which, of course, never fooled the Australian people when the time came. In that period to June 1995 they cut some 7,000 people from the public sector. The largest category of separations in 1994-95 was retrenchments.

         Clearly, on 11 March this year the Treasurer indicated that there would be two per cent savings in running costs. That came through on the basis of what we had seen leading up to the election. Clearly, the figures disclosed the then Minister for Finance's black hole. In addressing the Australian Public Service in respect of ethics, the Prime Minister indicated that he recognised that the impact would cause some pain. But we must get the books in some order for the long&amp;hyphen;term gain of this nation. We do not deny that there will be some impact on the Australian Public Service, but the message remains—send the bill to Beazley.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. There has clearly been considerable volatility in the labour force for some time. The trend unemployment rate in Labor's final days showed a disturbing rise—from 8.4 per cent in January to 8.6 per cent in April. Unemployment is a lagging indicator. The most recent problems are still the hangover of the Labor interest rate rises in 1994.

Caesar and the Imperial Court looked after themselves very well indeed—the most magnificent cedar panelling, the most magnificent brass taps, which I understand cost $200 each. They even had mahogany toilet seats. I suppose that was appropriate for the imperial style of the previous government.

It is worth the House's while to reflect on the words used by Mr Hughes when he said there had been `a kind of deliberate disavowal' of the importance of Australia's commercial and cultural links with Europe. Of course, as the honourable member pointed out in his question, this is entirely true. While all Australians know that this government's highest foreign policy priority is engagement with Asia, we do happen to be able to pursue a policy of engagement with Asia without creating the perception that somehow relations with Europe are yesterday's relations.

They were interested only in preserving government for themselves. The consequence of all that is that the people of Australia rejected Labor and their economic management.

It was the case that, as the economic and employment policies of the former government more and more obviously began to fail, the government began to pour money into the bureaucracy, and particularly into the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In 1987&amp;hyphen;88, the overall running costs of the department were $459 million. Since then, running costs have increased every year to a figure of $994 million in 1995&amp;hyphen;96.

        The key point that I want to make about the staff cuts that we have had to make in the department is that the vast bulk of them were planned by you because of the necessity to rein back this burgeoning bureaucracy. Of the 1,285 permanent staff reductions that were announced by the government in April, the vast proportion of them—no less than 965—were planned by the Labor Party. You must recognise that you had gone right over the top.

        Not only that, but the 600 temporary staff reductions that are due at the end of June were also planned by the Labor Party. So let's not hear this hypocrisy from the other side of the House about these cuts being the result of the coalition's need to cut back on your waste and expenditure. You were forced yourselves to recognise this and you should bear responsibility for these cuts.

         on 7 May there was a story which revealed that the Brisbane City Council—which has a budget of something like $400 million a year—introduced a policy

          which was pledging to use union labour only for contract work. I was pleased to see that the finance spokesman, Graham Quirk, who is a councillor with the Brisbane City Council, has raised his proper objections to it. They are objections which the government shares. We totally reject the Brisbane City Council's ham&amp;hyphen;fisted imposition of compulsory unionism.

        I think the Brisbane City Council is out of touch with the people of Queensland who, in the 2 March election, had a very clear view about some of these issues. In fact, there are only two Labor members left in Queensland, the balance of representation coming from the Liberal and National parties. As a result, I am pleased to be able to say to the House that the government will move to legislate against compulsory unionism and against preference clauses. It is really only those on the other side of the chamber and the Labor mayor of Brisbane who support the antediluvian policies that people should be discriminated against on the grounds that they do not have union membership.

        With only about 35 per cent of the Australian work force now in a union, it is a basically unfair proposition to say that because somebody chooses not to be in a union they should be denied work opportunities. The federal government will be proposing the abolition of compulsory unionism and preference clauses. I am also very pleased to say that I know it is the view of the incoming government in Queensland to legislate so that there is no safe haven for compulsory unionism and preference clauses in this country.

         —No, I was completely right and you were completely wrong. Let me make it entirely clear. If these allowances were not taxable—that is, they were already exempt—why did the Treasurer have to introduce legislation? Why? He had to introduce legislation, as his press release said—I  suggest you check it with him—to exempt these allowances. If the legislation had not been introduced, they would not have been exempted. So the question came to us: will you make good and introduce legislation to exempt them? All I have said is, `No, we won't.' Because we will not be introducing the legislation, they fall back to the law unamended, as it stood, which makes them taxable.

        The Income Tax Assessment Act says that income is taxable. Unless you introduce legislation to say, `This allowance is exempted,' as you proposed to do, it becomes taxable. You have got it completely confused, the wrong way around—hopelessly the wrong way around. What we are doing is leaving the situation exactly as it was—that is, without introducing legislation—the consequence of which is that it comes into the tax net, the consequence of which is that there is uniformity, the consequence of which is that, regardless of the militancy of the group concerned, the tax laws are going to be equally enforced. That is a principle of our government.

         —I am very pleased to say that the government believes that, in the first fortnight of the sittings after the recent election, we have demonstrated in very practical terms our commitment and resolve to improve parliamentary standards. I am very pleased to say that the Keating days are over. We demonstrated that by the reforms which were endorsed and approved by the parliament. I really think that, for all their usual criticisms,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          privately even the members on the other side would have to acknowledge the change in the tone and the way in which the parliament has been run. For example, every day we have had a question time we have had the whole of the frontbench here. The days of the rostered day off are over.

        Today, for example, we have had 25 questions asked. One of them got knocked off, but there were 24 or 25 questions. I have had the figures taken out. Mr Speaker, I know you will be very interested in this. If you take the average number of questions per question time over the years—going all the way back to 1970—the highest number was in 1976, when the average was 19.3 questions. With the questions that we have had just in the first fortnight, we have already exceeded that record.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also interesting that we have had substantive answers from ministers. They have been able to answer questions fairly and give people information as they are required to. If you look at the last 26 years and the average time taken for questions and answers, in the last fortnight the average time has been 3.5 minutes. But if you go back over just the last four years, the Keating years, the averages were 5.8, 4.7, 4.3 and 5.9—which is the all&amp;hyphen;time worst. So, to get a figure of the sort that we have had in the last couple of weeks, you really have to go back to the Fraser years, and I am sure the Prime Minister can remember the better standards in that time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have also had a number of ministerial statements made in the House, and I think that is very important. Under the previous administration, they generally preferred to have a press conference outside of the parliament rather than to have ministers making statements inside the parliament, where they properly should be made where possible.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are also moving to improve the authority of our committee structure. It is very important for members to have an opportunity to make a contribution. Even in a controversial debate such as we have had with Telstra, we had, I understand, 44 questions. In fact, on the second reading debate we exhausted the speakers on both sides.

         Those are four or five matters, but let me conclude by saying this. We always said that really the tone of the parliament was ultimately set by the Prime Minister of the day. Whilst we have made important structural changes to standing orders to buttress our policy of improving standards—and it has been demonstrated absolutely without any doubt whatsoever—I still think it is the case that, if you really want to change parliamentary standards, you have to make a change to the government and you have to have a Prime Minister who respects parliamentary standards. I do compliment the Prime Minister. In this most important of all of our democratic institutions he has made good the promise he made to lift parliamentary standards.

         —Mr Speaker, I raise a very small matter about the practice in the House today in respect of the Telstra bill. We were hoping that the Telstra debate would have been completed last night, and we said that to the opposition. They, however, were insistent on having further speakers contribute to the debate. We allowed the debate to go on last night and this morning. This morning I said to the opposition that we had a couple of maiden speeches to hear and a debate on parliamentary committees. I pointed out that, unless there was some arrangement by which they could move their amendments, it would make it difficult to get through these. On each and every occasion we attempted to facilitate the smooth handling of the amendments. We finally agreed to leave for the incorporation of the amendments. But on our reasonable requests to try to have at least some sensible discussion about it, the opposition decided that they wanted to run a filibuster. Eventually we had something like 10 divisions which simply took up the time of their own people.

         The practice of presenting this schedule to the House follows the undertaking by successive Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. In recent years the Keating Government responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. For the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament has been recorded as the date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.

          rose to support this opportunity to reflect on and to give support to the Commonwealth's initiatives to achieve stricter gun control. On Sunday, 28 April, like many other members of this House, I had flown to Canberra to begin the first week of the sittings of parliament. At about 4 o'clock I received a phone call to tell me that there were reports that perhaps up to 12 people had been shot in an incident in my state.

        Frankly, I did not know whether to accept that proposition. It seemed to me—and it still seems to me—that something of that kind could not happen in my own state of Tasmania. I made a very rapid decision, after ringing both the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), to return to Tasmania. At about 11 o'clock that night I had a briefing with the police who were running the response to the tragedy at Port Arthur. I met with the Tasmanian police minister, Mr John Beswick, and for the first time the enormity of what was happening sank through.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        John Beswick was there with all the blood drained out of his face—he looked absolutely ashen faced. The police were obviously in charge of the operation and they were acting through a process they had been trained to deal with, but in every lift and every corridor there was a sense of complete disbelief. On that same day, I, the Leader of the Opposition
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and the Prime Minister expressed our grief and our sense of helplessness. We all felt that loss of innocence that came with that tragedy.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, that was just the beginning of what has been a terrible incident in Australia's history. We, the Tasmanian members of the parliament, with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, attended a service on 1 May. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition went to Port Arthur and later returned to attend a deeply moving service. The director of the emergency health team at the hospital needed to be consoled, crying at that service. Dick Adams and I were both in tears during part of that service—and I am sure that was the case with many of our colleagues. This tragedy has made us confront the frailty of our own lives. Seeing how such innocent people had their lives snuffed out brought home to every one of us that it could have happened to each of us.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We were also confronted with the impossible question of what to say. Dick Adams and I went to the hospital and met, for example, Mr Neville Quinn. Mr Quinn had been shot through the neck. After his wife had been shot, he had been chased, cornered in a bus and shot. He then staggered to the pavement to lie next to his wife, Janet, while she died. What can you say to such a person? If you see someone with a bandage wrapped around their neck, what can you possibly say? Yet another appalling consequence of the tragedy was that Mr Quinn's mother-in-law, his wife's mother, died of a heart attack when she heard of the news.

        As a result of this tragedy, there has been an enormous and proper response by the Australian community to demand that we take action to reform our antiquated and inadequate gun laws. The Prime Minister has made a number of statements to this House, the tone and content of which we endorse entirely. The Leader of the Opposition has also spoken, both in the House and publicly, about the complete commitment we have as an opposition to supporting the government's initiatives to obtain, as the Prime Minister has said, a minimum of outcomes—that is, the wholesale registration of firearms throughout

        Now, fortunately, my state is beginning to return to normalcy. Port Arthur has been reopened. The people who have suffered loss and tragedy are dealing with their grief. Those who are not directly affected are going about their business more or less as if this incident can be put behind them—as it must, ultimately.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, there is a problem with returning to normalcy. Too frequently in the past, when incidents of this kind have happened, there has been this initial burst of concern, but it has been followed by a period where time has passed and the 90 per cent of Australians who support stricter gun laws go about their business. The 10 per cent who are opposed find their voice and find opportunities to bring political pressure on weak parts of the political system to stop what is the genuine public mood for reform at this time.

        I believe we do have an historic opportunity. We have an historic opportunity in the same way that historic opportunity presented itself to the people of the state of Tasmania through tragedy. There the Labor Party, with Michael Field as its leader, has joined with the Liberal Party and the Greens in an historic commitment to reform what were some of the worst gun laws in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Not only has the Tasmanian parliament made that historic commitment, but it has already legislated. It would not allow the time to pass to allow business to go back to normal, to allow the very small minority in our community the opportunity to cleave divisions between us, between our political parties, between our political interests, and to stop the process that is now well and truly afoot.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe this historic opportunity is right before us. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), and the shadow Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Senator Bolkus, should continue to make sure that we walk in lock step so that there can be no cleavage between us, no point of weakness, where the gun lobby can enter and take advantage of that moment of weakness.

         We have an historic framework here. There have been instances in the past where resolve has weakened over time. There was a committee on violence which led to a series of recommendations which were pursued by my predecessor, Senator Tate, with partial success. But Senator Tate obtained at least a starting point in each of the states and territories. For example, before his initiative, there had been no firearms control legislation in my state of Tasmania. By 1991, with the pressure from the Commonwealth, even that last state had moved. The Commonwealth has banned all military&amp;hyphen;style automatics and semi-automatics from importation. It has banned their bullets. It has taken many initiatives to try to bring a system together. But at the time of this tragic shooting, that system was still patchwork, with progress being gained inch by inch.

         I said to the Prime Minister yesterday, `I have been in your shoes.' Unfortunately, it was not with quite the same weight of public support. There was a Launceston meeting of police ministers where, after the officers had completed six months of work, we had before us a paper which had been prepared and was the product of a lot of consultation. It would have dealt with an effective ban on all these military&amp;hyphen;style weapons—automatics and semi-automatics. It would have banned private and mail order sales. It would have put tough rules on genuine reasons. It would have introduced a tougher licensing and training scheme and storage scheme. It would have done all the things that are the core of the Prime Minister's initiatives. But the day before the meeting, I became aware that that arrangement had fallen apart. The irony was that the chief protagonist of the resistance then was the state of Tasmania.

         It is another sad irony that the backsliding in the present debate seems to be generated out of Victoria. In the struggles I was involved in, as police minister, to try to get uniformity, it was the Deputy Premier of Victoria, Pat McNamara, who was probably my strongest ally. I make no partisan point there other than to say that this is a moment of time in which we must seize the opportunity to make these changes. Mr Howard is

         I believe that gun owners in the main are entirely responsible and sane citizens. They are people who understand the need for national gun law safety rules. There would not be 85 or 90 per cent public support for these changes if that were not the case. Unfortunately, there is a small minority of advocates of unrestricted gun ownership of a kind which we must reject. People like Ron Owens and his

         We do have a fork in the road, and we could go down the American way. In the United States in 1994, out of 250 million people, 39,250 died from firearms. In the UK and Japan, out of a total population of 181 million, there were just over a hundred deaths from firearms. There is a point: we must act, and act now. That voice must be a unified voice, representing all of the parties in the political system.

         When I was seeking to work through this, I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and my counterpart the then shadow Attorney-General, Amanda Vanstone, seeking their active and public cooperation. It is incidents like this, however, that draw the need for that out. It was not there. I make no point of that, but now we must act together. An incident like this cannot be allowed to be a tragedy without an outcome. The Prime Minister should know that he goes into tomorrow's meeting with his resolve steeled by the knowledge of support by all those members of this House who rose in support of this matter of public importance.

Let me acknowledge also the contribution he has made to this subject in his former capacity as Minister for Justice. Like the member for Denison, who has been in parliament a lot longer than I, I have never seen an MPI on which both sides of the House stood. It may be historic, I don't know. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) may be able to tell us, but it seems extraordinary that it has not happened at least in the last three years.

        When I first learnt of the tragedy I was at Melbourne airport on the Sunday night, a week and a half ago. I encountered the wife of the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who was on her way up here, hopefully, for celebrating the opening of parliament. She told me that she had just seen on the television in the airport a report that, at that stage, something like a dozen people had been killed. When I arrived in Canberra the number of people killed had increased to 25, and the media were already expressing the concern that the public have expressed continuously since.

         The member for Denison mentioned the sequence of bursts of concern that have followed massacres such as the Hoddle Street, Queen Street and Strathfield massacres. From the vantage of a week on, this one does seem different. The fact that the public has expressed across the country, across political party divisions, across state and territory boundar ies, virtually unanimous support—to the extent you can get that sort of measure in opinion polls—for banning automatic and semi&amp;hyphen;automatic weapons and for instituting a national gun register is a good measure of the public demanding action.

I am not going to comment on anything that may have been said by members of parliament or ministers in other states or territories prior to the meeting. As he indicated, what counts is what happens tomorrow. I have great confidence that what will come out of that meeting tomorrow is a consensus on the basic Commonwealth proposals. Those Commonwealth proposals involve banning all semi&amp;hyphen;automatic and automatic weapons and restricting their use to government or official purposes—military and specialist police—with a very limited use in relation to employment in such areas as the culling of large feral animals. I am also confident that we will move down the path to a national gun register and that those states which do not have registration systems will introduce them and will link them to the national network run through the National Exchange of Police Information.

        I welcome the opposition's continuing bipartisan support for the strong stance taken by the Commonwealth, particularly for its support of the thrust of the proposals circulated to state and territory ministers on Tuesday—and, I might add, circulated to members and senators in this parliament.

        The government is fully committed to achieving the standards set out in those proposals. We on this side of the House believe that the Australian public will not accept anything less.

        The Commonwealth is not intending to adopt a position of moral superiority over the states and territories, but it has to be acknowledged that responsibility for legislation in relation to gun control rests with the states and territories. The state and territory laws are not totally inadequate. In fact, some of the proposals the Commonwealth is putting forward rely upon particular measures that have already been taken in some of the states. A major concern is that we lack a uniform system of comprehensive minimum standards in all of the vital areas. This is what we really hope to achieve at tomorrow's conference.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It may assist community understanding if I explain some of the background to the positions taken by the Commonwealth. The main issue which has been raised in the debate is the extent of the proposed ban on firearm ownership. The Commonwealth proposals do not have the effect of banning all firearms from the community. Rather, the licensing regime is put forward by the Commonwealth as a means of classifying weapons in accordance with the relative dangerousness of the firearm and the uses to which it may be put. Essentially, the proposed bans extend to all automatic and semi&amp;hyphen;automatic long arms. By that we mean self&amp;hyphen;loading weapons which are fired from the shoulder, such as shotguns and rifles. The ban also extends to pump action shotguns which have a capacity of more than seven rounds.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The weapons to be prohibited are considered to be particularly dangerous since they are capable of inflicting greater damage than other weapons. The fact that they are automatic or semi&amp;hyphen;automatic means that many shots can be fired in a short time. The Commonwealth's view is that these weapons are needed only for certain limited government purposes—military and police—and for professional shooters who have been licensed for a specifically recognised purpose, such as the contract extermination of large feral animals. The latter group was included to meet concerns about the effect of proposed
        <break page="771" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         bans on situations where the use of high powered semi&amp;hyphen;automatic rifles is considered essential—for example, the culling of buffalo in the Northern Territory. The government does not believe that the general public should have access to such weapons or that those weapons are needed by members of the public.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With respect to the reported opposition of some members of the farming community, it should be stressed that the proposed ban does not extend to all rifles. For example, members of the rural community who need a low powered .22 calibre bolt action rifle for controlling pests and killing diseased livestock may still possess such weapons, provided they meet the other general requirements set out in the scheme.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A critical point of the proposal is that they not be permitted to use automatic or semi-automatic rifles for this purpose. In this respect I draw some comfort from a report in yesterday's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald
        </emphasis>
        which indicated that a number of farmers interviewed do not consider that they need to use automatic or semi-automatic weapons. I am also advised that the President of the United Graziers Association, Mr Larry Acton, has supported such a ban and has argued that semi-automatics were needed only in `extenuating circumstances', to use his words, and should not be privately owned. As I advised the House on Tuesday, it is very clear from newspaper reports that opinion polls show that the community is overwhelmingly in favour of the proposed ban.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not accept the argument that a ban on all semi-automatic rifles, including low calibre ones, should be seen as unjustified. Although military style weapons, such as those involved in the tragedy at Port Arthur, are clearly the worst sort of semi-automatic firearms, the Commonwealth's view is that all semi-automatic weapons are highly dangerous and should not be available within the community. Today's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Herald&amp;hyphen;Sun

        To the extent that governments have the power to prevent such tragedies as Port Arthur occurring, I believe that all responsible
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         governments have a duty to do so. One sometimes hears suggestions that the Commonwealth will be interfering with the right of Australians to own firearms. I totally reject this argument. Gun ownership is not a right. Rather, it should be seen as a conditional privilege reserved for those with a genuine reason and subject to appropriate controls. I am more attracted to an argument that all Australians have a right to exist in a society where they are not subject to the needless risk of being injured or killed as a consequence of the widespread availability and irresponsible use of firearms.

        Citizens are subject to regulation with respect to other less inherently dangerous activities, such as driving motor vehicles. In order to be permitted to drive a car persons must satisfy certain requirements, including licence tests and periodic registration of the vehicle. Moreover, persons are not allowed to drive any vehicle on roads simply because they want to. It would be ludicrous to suggest that persons have a right to drive formula 1 race cars simply because of their performance. I believe that the same arguments apply equally, if not more so, to arguments suggesting that the government should not interfere with the so-called rights of gun owners.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As members will be aware, the Commonwealth has put forward proposals in relation to the entire regime of gun controls. Apart from the question of prohibition, they address a range of key issues, including compensation for surrendered weapons, the development of safety training, uniform standards for the storage of firearms, effective nationwide licensing and registration requirements, a scheme requiring a permit to purchase each firearm and provisions relating to mail order sales. The proposals are minimum standards which the community would accept, following the tragic events at Port Arthur. In achieving these standards, I am confident that we will meet a number of vital objectives. There will be a reduction in the number of firearms in Australia. All automatic and semi-automatic long&amp;hyphen;arm weapons, other than for very limited purposes, will be eliminated and firearms access will be denied to persons who are either assessed as unfit or who are unable to
        <break page="772" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para first-indent="16">
        The government accepts that these changes cannot be implemented without an amnesty and appropriate compensation. I have therefore recommended in the proposal to police ministers that a six-month national amnesty be established, underpinned by a compensation scheme. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has previously stated, the costs of such a scheme should be borne by the whole community, not just by those people surrendering firearms.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As outlined by the Prime Minister to the House on Monday, the government recognises that the proposed prohibitions will inevitably cause some difficulty for tens of thousands of Australians who do possess firearms. Like the Prime Minister, I am confident that the community will match the national need and rise to the occasion in this time of difficulty. I therefore urge all jurisdictions to recognise that we must work together to achieve a genuine consensus between all states and territories on this vital matter, with a view to ensuring that we have uniform effective controls on weapons across Australia. I thank the opposition for its support.

I believe that the people in the community, particularly those who have suffered as a result of this madman in Tasmania, and others, deserve more than a knee-jerk reaction. Both members who have  spoken in this debate today know full well that automatic weapons have been banned in Australia in every state since about 1924. They also know that the Commonwealth government has the full power to stop the import of military style automatic weapons or, in fact, any automatic weapon. To say that they are going to put a ban on semi-automatic weapons and outlaw .22s and shotguns is simply an enormous overreaction.

        I turn to the question of compensation. The government has said it will compensate, as indeed the constitution requires. Ted Drane from the Sporting Shooters Association says that he estimates compensation to be $500 million. I suspect Mr Drane is talking about Victoria alone, because the cost will be substantially higher. If the government is going to compensate, there are only two bases on which it can be done—either the purchase price or the replacement cost. If compensation is based on the purchase price, the total will run to far more than $500 million Australia&amp;hyphen;wide and compensation based on the replacement cost will be even more.

        Let us look at some other hard facts which the government and the opposition know about. In the southern states and my own state of Western Australia, 25 per cent of guns are registered, which means that 75 per cent are not registered. Queensland has done it somewhat better because 40 per cent of guns in that state are registered. If the government brings in this legislation the only guns which can be addressed are the ones which are registered and those guns are clearly in the hands of the more responsible element in the community. What is the government going to do about the others? Those guns will simply go underground and the problem is that we will not know the dimensions of the guns and therefore cannot contend with them.

         assault rifle is infinitely better than the gun used by the Australian army. Perhaps that is something else which should be looked at. This weapon is very effective for killing people, as military rifles are. They are not good hunting weapons. Generally, they are inaccurate over distances and are ideally suited for killing people at short range. In Switzerland every family has one in the house and 24 bullets to go with it in a sealed container, yet Switzerland has one of the lowest incidents of murder in the world. In Switzerland they will tell you that most of the crimes in that country are in fact committed by foreigners. That is another great triumph for multiculturalism!

In large parts of rural and northern Australia people have these guns and know how to use them. I suspect that very few of them will be prepared to give them up.

Many tragedies have occurred in this country.

        Mrs Bailey, I retired from the Army after 26 years service in 1992. I served in Vietnam with the SAS and I have seen soldiers seriously wounded by weapons similar to those used at Port Arthur last Sunday. Such weapons are not needed for any purpose other than military purposes. Frankly, they are designed for rapid, hard hitting shooting, where every shot is to seriously wound or kill an enemy soldier so that he cannot wound or kill you. The calibre of the weapons, their muzzle velocity, their rate of fire and the number of rounds of ammunition that can be carried in the magazines for the weapons clearly illustrate their purpose.

If the states do not cooperate—because there is no doubt that what is required is cooperation from all state governments—then I say to the minister at the table and to the Prime Minister, `Let us have a referendum and give the Commonwealth the powers.'

        The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Offshore Minerals Act 1994, the Wool International Act 1993, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Act 1993, the Poultry Assistance Act 1965 and the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988. The bill will also repeal three acts and make consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 because of the repeal of these acts.

        The bill contains an amendment to section 15 of the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 to preserve the integrity of licences granted under the act, the boundaries of which might be affected by changes in the location of the territorial sea baseline. At present, the section applies only where changes to the baseline might be caused by natural processes such as tides or storms. The amendment expands the section to apply it to changes in the location of the baseline resulting from acquisition of new data or reconsideration of existing data. The amendment has been made necessary by a recent case where the integrity of licences has been brought into question by a change in

        This amendment to the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 is required following a change in the representative organisation of the egg industry and a subsequent request from the industry for acknowledgment of the recently formed Australian Egg Industry Association, AEIA, as the representative industry organisation on matters requiring industry consultation in place of the former industry body—the Australian Council of Egg Producers, ACEP. The AEIA now needs to be acknowledged in the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 to provide it with a legal basis to make recommendations on behalf of industry on levy related matters.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The act imposes a levy in respect of laying chickens hatched and provides regulations for the purposes of levy rates, with the amount of levy as recommended by the now defunct ACEP. Funds raised under this levy currently reside in the Poultry Industry Trust Fund, PITF, established by the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965. This act needs to be amended to facilitate the transfer of funds from the PITF to the Egg Industry Development Fund administered by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation for research and development on the egg industry. The Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 along with the Egg Industry Research (Hen Quota) Levy Act 1987 and Poultry Industry Levy Act 1965 will be repealed once the transfer of the funds has been made.

        The AEIA has also requested an increase in the research and development component of the levy from 1 July 1996, subject to legislative amendment to the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 acknowledging the AEIA as the representative body for these purposes. The egg industry has not increased its contribution to research and development for a number of years and the proposed increase will have the effect of maintaining the real value of its research and development activities. It would be appropriate that any amendment to the act facilitate future changes in industry representative organisation status in a manner similar to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, eliminating the need for legislative amendment for any future

        The establishment of Wool International in 1993 was part of a strategy to develop a much stronger and commercially driven Australian wool industry, in more direct control over its destiny.

         —That depends a bit on your shadow minister over there. This package of amendments to the Wool International Act 1993 is part of an evolutionary process, and includes, amongst other things, termination of voluntary, or additional, contributions of wool tax over and above 4.5 per cent of the sale value of shorn wool other than carpet wool. That will be widely welcomed by the industry and I think they await with great expectation that relief. I would note in passing that it is the result, easily lost sight of in the current circumstances that the wool industry is in, of the fact that wool prices recovered more strongly and faster than was anticipated following the passage of the 1993 act. In addition the amendments include setting the amount payable to Wool International in respect of the stockpile debt component of wool tax by regulation; and enabling Wool International to undertake a program to develop and evaluate the forward marketing of wool through its subsidiary, Wool International Holdings.

         The bill also proposes two amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993.

         The payment by growers of the compulsory 4.5 per cent debt component of wool tax from 1 July 1993 onwards entitles them to a share in any surplus from the sale of the stockpile by Wool International, to be made available once the associated government guaranteed debt has been retired. It also entitles them, should they so choose, to take up equity in any privatised Wool International.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Wool International Act 1993 provides for eligible wool tax payers to gain additional entitlements by making voluntary contributions up to 5.5 per cent of the sale value of shorn wool, other than carpet wool, in addition to the 4.5 per cent stockpile debt component of wool tax. Nobody seems to want to do that at the moment anyway, but they did when things looked a bit brighter. The circumstances in the wool industry have changed markedly since the present statutory framework was put in place in 1993. For example, there is now anticipated to be a significant surplus arising from stockpile sales after the government guaranteed debt has been retired. There is, therefore, no need for voluntary contributions to repay debt.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Retaining the provision could also result in a small number of large, well&amp;hyphen;off, producers enhancing their entitlements at the expense of other eligible wool tax payers not in a financial position to make voluntary contributions. The proposed legislative amendments therefore provide for the cessation of voluntary wool tax contributions retrospective to 20 June 1995, the date of the announcement.

The recommendation must have regard to the legislated percentage of wool tax payable to Wool International in respect of debt reduction. Under the proposed amendments, this amount will now be set by regulation.

         As part of its legislated functions, Wool International has been examining various options for further developing risk management mechanisms for the industry.

        This bill repeals the Training Guarantee Act 1990 and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 and amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992.

        The training guarantee scheme was introduced on 1 July 1990 by the previous government to increase the quality and quantity of training provided by industry. While it was clear that there was a need to improve the training effort, the training guarantee did not receive widespread support. It imposed a mandatory financial commitment on all but very small companies that did not reflect the quality or relevance of training provided.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Over the period that the training guarantee was operational, employer dissatisfaction with the scheme increased. The government in the end acknowledged the fact that the scheme was not operating effectively and it was suspended by the former government in July 1994 for a period of two years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the election, the government outlined its intention to abolish the training guarantee scheme as it has become evident that the training guarantee was not the answer to Australia's comparatively low levels of training. This bill gives effect to the government's commitment, and will repeal the

        The government will develop a modern, relevant training system that is flexible, responsive and meets the needs of industry.

        The bill also provides for the amendment of subsection 22a(3) of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. This amendment addresses an anomaly created through the Higher Education Funding Act (No. 2) 1995, which allocated funds under subsection 22a(5) for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998. As a result of an oversight, subsection 22a(3) was not amended at the same time to enable determinations to be made approving the expenditure of funding for these years.

        The current act provides funding to 30 June 1997. This bill amends the funding level for the period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1997 and establishes funding levels up to 30 June 2000.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These funding levels reflect an increase of $7.85 million on the existing appropriation for 1996, and establish the commonwealth's commitment under this act for each year of the third triennium of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. Funding under the act is appropriated on a triennial calendar year basis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government intends to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. The restructuring of the Aboriginal education strategic results program will accelerate development of culturally appropriate indigenous education services under rigorous outcomes focused accountability arrangements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In terms of program administration, those changes will establish a more cost&amp;hyphen;effective, more transparent, more manageable and, critically, a more accountable process for the distribution of commonwealth funds. Parties to an indigenous education agreement will receive funding in two ways: either by way of a per capita entitlement basis or on the basis of strategic results projects.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Both elements will focus on ensuring that the program is a value for money program which achieves improved educational outcomes for indigenous Australians. This will mean negotiating a higher level of educational accountability for these Commonwealth funds. The supplementary funding from the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program is the Commonwealth's principal program for indigenous education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The per capita element of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program will provide an entitlement-based, equitable, recurrent funding arrangement. It will recog nise the different resource bases of education providers as well as accommodating the higher costs of education provision in remote areas and in some sectors. Such acknowledgment is a prerequisite for establishing outcomes based accountability arrangements.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The element known as the strategic results projects will provide funding required to undertake priority projects of national significance that will contribute to achieving policy goals by 2001. Such projects, in order to receive Commonwealth funding, must demonstrate that they deal with major barriers to educational attainment such as high drop&amp;hyphen;out rates and low retention rates. These projects will remove barriers to attainment that cannot be addressed by mainstream programs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Projects will be for a specific period of time, will have specified purposes, outcomes and targets and will be subject to an accountability system which will focus much more than in the past on the monitoring and reporting of improved educational outcomes rather than just financial inputs. The implementation of such rigorous accountability measures will ensure a comprehensive improvement in the achievement of goals for reducing the educational disadvantage of indigenous Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many factors contribute to that educational disadvantage. The identification of the causes of such high levels of educational disadvantage is complex. In acknowledging this complexity, the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy reflects the importance of a cooperative, collaborative effort to develop more effective processes for education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The policy is based on the principle of shared effort and shared responsibility with state and territory governments in consultation with indigenous people. The tripartite nature of this partnership is a key component of the determination to achieve better outcomes from all sectors of indigenous education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The 1994 review of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy found that between 1989 and 1993 the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on to year 12 of
        <break page="784" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         school increased from 14 per cent to about 33 per cent. During the same period, the number of indigenous students attending university doubled. Despite such encouraging improvements in educational outcomes, indigenous people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. From preschool right through to university, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders participate and attain significantly less in education than their non&amp;hyphen;indigenous peers.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For example, at primary school level, three times as many indigenous students have literacy and numeracy problems as do other primary students. At secondary school level, 25 per cent of indigenous students leave school before completing year 10, compared to two per cent of other Australians. The year 12 retention rate for indigenous students is 33 per cent, compared to 76 per cent for other Australians. The importance of quality education is clear.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These amendments to the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act will provide funding to improve education opportunities and outcomes for indigenous people. Economic efficiency and social justice concerns require education to provide a basic foundation of opportunity for all people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is agreement within the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, following reaffirmation of its commitment to the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, that states and territories will set literacy, numeracy and employment targets in their indigenous education agreements for Aboriginal education strategic initiatives funding in the next triennium. These are key issues requiring increased effort and rigorous monitoring of strategies to ensure their success.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Efforts will also be concentrated on the early childhood education years to ensure better outcomes in literacy and numeracy. There will also be efforts to concentrate on the employment of indigenous people at all levels of the education and training industry.

        Whilst we welcome the decision of the government to move for the establishment of these general purpose committees, we do have a number of issues that we want to raise in relation to them. I say this at the outset because it does go to the question generally of this assertion that the new government is making the parliament more accountable and giving it primacy. We have seen today already in the Telstra debate a circumstance in which the government says that it is the
        <break page="786" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         —It is true. Despite an understanding we had that in the consideration in detail stage we would be able to not just move our amendments but to actually speak to them, that was denied in all but one case. Here we have the most important issue that this government campaigned on in the election. They have come into this place indicating that they want the parliament to really scrutinise what they do, but they deny the parliament the opportunity to debate it.

        I think we do have to always qualify the unction with which the Leader of the House gets up here from time to time to assert that he is really trying to introduce new standards into the place. The fact of the matter is that we did not add more speakers to the second reading debate. We exhausted that list. The understanding was that at the conclusion of that we would have the opportunity to get the amendments. But they denied it; they moved the gag. Not only did they do that, they prevented us even raising these points in the third reading debate, and I think that is appropriate in the debate on the third reading of a speech.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Therefore, we take this opportunity to draw your attention to that. I think it is a serious matter of concern that for the first major piece of legislation which is introduced into this parliament the government denied the opposition the opportunity to move amendments and speak to them. That is just the first—only the first. I guess that, despite all that they profess to support by way of greater accountability and greater primacy of the parliament, it is just one of many instances where they will revert to simply ramming this stuff through despite the objections on this side and our right to raise certain issues.

        The other point that I would make relates to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) getting up at the end of question time to argue that question time now makes the parliament more accountable. I think you would have to say that any independent observer who has been

         in this House listening to question time for the last two weeks would be struggling to know what had been answered. The reality is that, despite the fact that there have been more questions asked in this parliament, there have been very few answers given. Ministers simply come to the table and either obfuscate or refuse to answer questions. One could hardly call that accountability.

        There is no point in pretending that, simply because more questions are being processed through the place, parliament is being made accountable. Simply getting the ministers to turn up in parliament each question time does not make them accountable if they refuse to answer questions. As we have continued to point out on this side of the House, it is all very well asserting that you make ministers accountable by their turning up to the parliament but, unless there is some preparedness on the part of the government to address the issue of what constitutes relevancy in answers to questions, the problem is going to continue.

        Whilst the committees have been set up, they have stripped their numbers to ensure that the opposition does not get a fair crack at representation on those committees. The effect of this motion relates, in essence, not just to the establishment of committees but also to their composition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under the old arrangements, committees comprised 12 members of the House—seven from the government and five from the opposition. We do not argue against the notion that the government of the day has the majority on committees. That is not the point. But what we see from the amendments being moved is that the government is going to increase the membership from 12 to 14, but the two additional members will go to the government. We are told that, in addition to the five that we have to deal with, we have to accommodate the Independents group within that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We recognise that the Independents group are part of the non&amp;hyphen;government parties. We recognise that we have to have discussions with them to accommodate their interests. But the more sensible way of addressing this point is to increase the size of committees by one and to ensure that the opposition parties have six members, not five. It does not diminish the nine that this government is seeking for its own side. It increases the size of committees by one and enables the opposition to be appropriately represented.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the issue of representation, it is argued that this nine&amp;hyphen;five split represents the proportional carve&amp;hyphen;up of this parliament. We argue that, if you are going to do it on a proportional basis, then, in the first instance, you have to take out of the numbers against which you draw the proportions the people who cannot sit on committees—ministers and parliamentary secretaries, and, of course, the Speaker.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In our view, that would reduce the number of members eligible to sit on committees from 147 to 123. Of that 123, there are 69 government members, 49 opposition members and five independent members. If you do the proportional carve&amp;hyphen;up of the 123 government and non&amp;hyphen;government members, you should have eight government members and six non&amp;hyphen;government members on committees. Indeed, if we were really applying this rule in the way asserted by the Leader of the House—to represent proportionality—then we would really see committees of 14, divided into eight and six.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have circulated an amendment in the interests of trying to give the opposition appropriate representation on these committees. The amendment proposes that we substitute the government's words with the following words:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         "Each Committee appointed under paragraph (a) shall consist of 15 members, with membership of each committee reflecting the proportion of government to non&amp;hyphen;government Members in the House, namely, nine government and six non&amp;hyphen;government Members".
        </para>
        <para>
         I have tried to indicate to the Leader of the House that this would be a more sensible way to go. He says that we are filibustering in this debate and that he really wants to get these things set up.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If he were genuine about getting these committees set up, he would find that the easy solution would be to agree to our proposition. There are people on our side of the House who want to argue very strongly for increased opposition representation on these committees. They are people who have participated in the committee structure, unlike me. I was a minister in the previous government and did not have the opportunity to participate in the committee structure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that there are many instances where parliamentary committees have significantly improved the accountability of the parliament. They have involved themselves in extensive consultations and in considerations of very significant matters of great national importance; they have made recommendations; they have called for submissions; they have consulted all sorts of interested groups;
         <break page="788" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and they have been able to take the parliament out into the nation, rather than consider it all here in this closeted atmosphere. This has provided a circumstance in which real input and accountability can come through the committee structure.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we are serious about arguing for better standards of the parliament and better service by the parliament of the needs of the nation, we have to make the committee structure work. If we are going to make it work, there has to be appropriate recognition of representation by opposition members. It is not as if, by increasing the size by one and still having a breakdown of nine to six, the government is going to be in a difficult position on contentious issues, but it does allow much more effective representation and accountability.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another point we would argue is the concern raised in this House by way of questions to the Speaker on one occasion—I think in question time—going to the issue of resourcing committees. There is no point establishing them unless they have the resources to function—the secretariat service, the ability to convene meetings, to take the submissions and to prepare information.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those on this side of the House who have participated in the committee structure have spoken with a great deal of admiration for the support they have been given by the various committee secretariats. With every report that has been tabled we have heard members attest to the professionalism and effectiveness of those who serve the committees. Yet, if the rumours—the suggestions—that abound that the government is going to cut the numbers and resources are true, committees will not get the proper servicing they require and the accountability of committees will be diminished. So it is a question of better accountability through better representation of the opposition and also through ensuring that committees are properly served by the secretariat.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The final point I refer to goes to the structure of the committees. I know that the Leader of the House sought indulgence to refer to some other matters that might come up later about the committees. I want to make reference to one of the committees that has

          —Precisely, Mr Deputy Speaker. We know in the last election that when the government was campaigning, it had no vision for this country. We saw the Leader of the Opposition indicate that his vision for the future was, `It's my turn. You should let me become Prime Minister. I've been hanging around for a long time. That's why I want to be Prime Minister.' We take the view that parliaments have to think beyond their three&amp;hyphen;year term. When one looks at the role that the Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies played—the committee that was chaired by the member for Lalor (Mr Jones) in the last parliament—one will see that some very significant issues came from that committee for consideration by the House. For example, Australia's population carrying capacity, the information revolution and the workplace of the future are all issues that parliament should be thinking about.

         —Of course not, because the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is not interested in democracy in this House. He won the election and, quite rightly, the election gives him a mandate to do things, but there is also an issue of accountability in this place. The Leader of the House has to understand that part of that accountability is the parliamentary committee system. All that the opposition is asking for is a bit of fairness. In this House 123 members are able to participate in the committee system—the Speaker cannot, the ministers cannot, nor can the parliamentary secretaries. If you want to be strictly proportional—as the Leader of the House told us earlier in this debate he wanted to be—a strict proportionality of those members who are available to be members of committees would give the government—on a 14&amp;hyphen;member committee—eight members and the non&amp;hyphen;government members would have six.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The reality is that the government wants to destroy the convention of the past and take away, once again, another area of accountability to which parliament can call the government. We as the opposition would say that that is not a reasonable thing to do. I do not know why the Leader of the House is so frightened by the committee system, because the reality has been in the past that very few committees have had minority reports. The vast majority of their reports have been unanimous. Governments in the past have found the reports of a lot of the committees to be very helpful. In fact, ministers in the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         past have asked committees to carry out inquiries for them into areas which were difficult for the government, but if they could get a bipartisan approach out of a committee, then it was a useful process.

        But to do that the opposition needs to have a reasonable representation on the committee.
