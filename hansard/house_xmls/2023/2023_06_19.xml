            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is proudly built on Multiculturalism, STOP the apparent ethnic bias by the Australian Government in handling Afghan Humanitarian Visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All Afghan ethnic groups have served and sacrificed their lives within the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its allied international troops including Australian Defence Force.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As result of their services to the coalition forces, many Afghans from all ethnic backgrounds are actively being pursued by Taliban. They have been captured, detained, unlawfully killed and their property, bank accounts, and assets have been seized as spoils of war.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recent reports by human rights organisations include terror stories from all corners of Afghanistan, affecting all ethnic groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Afghan population living in Australia consists of various ethnic groups. We ask to end the institutionalised biases in favour of one group and/or against other groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian Afghans have sponsored their loved ones whose cases might be at the mercy of the recent discriminatory policy of the Department of Home Affairs. It focuses on pre-defined priority groups in clear contravention of the refugee conventions. Australia's obligation under those conventions are being undermined by the policy. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghans who are inside Afghanistan for reasons beyond their control are being rejected due to the geographic disposition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to ensure humanitarian visas are granted on the basis of merit, undertaking adequate risk assessments and other eligible criteria.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The impacts of COVID-19 is still rampant in the construction industry across Australia. The Federal Government has acknowledged that there is a national housing crisis and has already committed to increase housing supply as a matter of national interest and to reduce homelessness. Unfortunately, due to rising inflation and over-stimulus in the construction sector, shortage of skilled staff, rising cost of living and other global factors, many Australians are experiencing the additional financial and emotional hardship of finding a new builder to finish their house after the collapse of several residential builders across Australia. More recently, more than 1700 Porter Davis customers will encounter financial hardship in finishing their home through no fault of their own. The Federal Government has a duty to ensure that these houses are finished in a timely manner to free up housing stock. The Government also as a responsibility to support customers given the lack of consumer protection in the construction industry.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to introduce the Home Rescue Guarantee scheme to cover the difference in cost of finishing incomplete homes in exchange for a percentage stake in the build that can be repaid by the customers once they are in a financial position to do so. This will allow customers to minimise unexpected out of pocket expenses and give them a real chance to move into their dream home. On a national level, the scheme will ensure increased housing stock and is financially sustainable for people to access.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, respectfully request an urgent inquiry into the ongoing cost of living crisis in our country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rising cost of housing, food, energy, and other essential goods and services has made it increasingly difficult for many Australians to make ends meet. This has led to widespread financial stress, with families struggling to pay bills, put food on the table, and maintain a decent standard of living.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2019 petition EN0963 asked parliament to determine the eligibility of Mr Dutton to sit because of his child care centres receiving tens of millions in Commonwealth funding. EN4465 was refused to be put to parliament for being similar to EN0963. EN0963 related to the 2019 election, EN4465 to the 2022 election. Two totally different events.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2019 petition was answered by Mr Porter (AG) saying the Solicitor General stated : Mr Dutton is "not incapable" of sitting as a member of parliament," Mr Porter left out the rest of the Solicitor General's statement in that " there is still "some risk" the high court might find he has a conflict of interest." </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is still some risk Mr Dutton has a conflict of interest and is in breach of S44 of the constitution. The only place that can be determined is at the High Court, not in parliament and not on a register written by the politician. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to refer Mr Dutton to the High Court to assess if he is ineligible to nominate for election because of the indirect pecuniary interest of his wife and children getting millions in Commonwealth funding for their child care centres. The Solicitor General's reasoning from 2018 can be used because there is still "some risk" he has a conflict of interest." </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">There are a huge number of petitions put up by the same individuals who have an axe to grind, often with extremist views and who obviously nothing better to do with their time. I believe this results in a massive waste of taxpayer dollars through reviewing and responding to tedious petitions from vexatious individuals. There are over 25 million people in this country and individuals with single digit support are wasting precious resources on constant complaints about vapid garbage. I believe the parliament should reserve a right to ignore constant submissions from the same serial posters in the interests of efficiency. These are our tax dollars that are being wasted because certain people have nothing better to do. Not every post is worthy of a response.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 April 2022 the Prime Minister promised to implement a world class national newborn screening program lifting the current number of diseases screened from 28 to 80 in 2023 as part of his election commitments to Medicare. </span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, he has empowered the committee that has recommended it is cheaper for babies not to be born than screened for diseases at birth to be the gateway for access in a process that takes at least 12 months per disease to complete. Under this process Australia will not screen for 80 diseases until at least 2050 and with no commitment to universal access across Australia. The postcode lottery and discriminatory diagnosis odyssey are both continuing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The election commitment costing clearly shows the program was to be to a once-off catch up review of 85 diseases screened for in the US and their applicability to Australia and rollout the 80 disease screening program across Australia in 2023. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">PhD students contribute enormously to Australia's research every year, with their time accounting for 56% the total research output. They are the future professors and industry professionals of this country, responsible for driving innovation and ensuring strong international collaborations and competition. Their contribution is often rewarded with a stipend intended to cover the cost of living, with a minimum rate set by the Australian government.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, this scholarship rate is $29,863 per year for PhD students to live on while usually working more than 40 hrs per week on their research. Not only is this below minimum wage, but it is even forcing students to live below the poverty line. With this treatment, students are incentivised to accept positions abroad, reject higher degrees by research, or quit midway through their degree due to financial distress. Australia is actively discouraging higher education and slowing its economic growth and productivity by underpaying PhD students.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dravet syndrome is a rare catastrophic form of epilepsy that is medication resistant. Fenfluramine is a medication that has been around since the 1960s and has recently been repurposed after it was discovered to have significant impact in reducing seizure activity in people with Dravet syndrome. A study conducted in 2019 showed that Fenfluramine has been effective in reducing monthly convulsion seizure frequency by 54%. A second study of a bigger participant group &amp; slightly higher dose per kg showed a reduction of 74.9%. Unfortunately, Fenfluramine is currently not on the PBS &amp; this revolutionary drug is costing families up to $10,000 every 60 days. That's $60,000 a year. Patients with Dravet are at an higher risk of ICU admission, and with each night in ICU costing the system up to $5000, placing Fenfluramine on the PBS will likely reduce the cost burden on the healthcare system. The burden of disease is already extremely high, and the risk of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is heightened in people with Dravet, so often parents are full time carers on limited incomes. Placing the medication on the PBS will ease some of the stress placed on those caring for someone with Dravet &amp; change so many peoples lives. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As a concerned citizen and supporter of my local community, I am deeply troubled by the potential impact of the new 60-day scrips policy on independent small pharmacy business owners. It is clear that these hardworking entrepreneurs are at high risk of closing their businesses due to the estimated $170,000 losses they may suffer each year under this change. This loss of revenue will undoubtedly cause these small pharmacies to reduce staff hours and slash services, ultimately hurting the very communities they serve. That is why I am calling on the government to explore alternative solutions that will help these pharmacies stay in business and continue to provide essential services to the people who rely on them. It is our responsibility to support these vital members of our community and ensure that they are able to thrive, not just survive.</span>

Therefore, we hope that you will work towards finding a solution that benefits everyone involved.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 27 April 2023, the Minister of Home Affairs Clare O'Neil announced at the National Press Club that the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold (TSMIT) will be increased to $70,000 from $53,900 from 01 July 2023.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, the pathway to become Permanent Residents for visa 491 holders is to apply for visa 191 after meeting the criteria. One of the key criteria requires the applicant to have at least 03 years with taxable income of at least equal to TSMIT.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many 491 visa holders have been on this visa for 2 or 3 years, and they have been earning enough to meet the current TSMIT. Many other applicants awaiting for their visa 491 grants decided to commit to this pathway because of the achiveable TSMIT of $53,900.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, with the proposed change of TSMIT from Minister Clare O'Neil, the future and pathway to permanent residency of those 491visa holders, as well as current unfinalised 491 applicants, are put in jeopardy. More seriously, it will worsen the image and the honesty of Australia government in particular, and Australia as a country, because of a broken promise to thousands lives.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to question the Department of Home Affairs thoroughly in regards to the change of TSMIT, with careful consultations and researches on the negative impacts to visa 491 holders and prospects.</span>

He came to Australia as a 4 year old, lived here as a PR for 54 years, holds degrees in Engineering, Accounting, Mathematics and Economics, worked as an engineer and a maths/physics teacher, has an Australian daughter and partner. He has never been violent, no sexual, child or spousal abuse and no drug use yet the DOHA Director refused to present his case to the Minister which is a complete breach of High Court Matter No M32/2022 Martin Davis v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs &amp; Ors and Matter No S81/2022 DCM20 v Secretary of Department of Home Affairs &amp; Anor [2023] HCA 10, Date of Judgment: 12 April 2023 M32/2022 &amp; S81/2022.

We need more invested in education. We cannot waste so much money on this AUKUS deal. It is known that the building of submarines run over budget and overtime. We don't support warmongering corporations lining their Pockets with each job created costing the Australian tax payer millions per year.

This is the latest exercise in nanny state overreach. These restrictions would ostensibly reduce vaping among the young, but as Albert Camus said, "The welfare of humanity is always the alibi of tyrants." The anti-smoking campaigns of the 80's were just the thin end of the wedge. We have have seen ever-increasing state intrusion into our lives over the last several decades, and we need to reverse that trend. We are in a vicious cycle where the existence of nanny state laws is used as justification for implementing more nanny state laws. The Covid response demonstrated that the government does not care about the health of Australian citizens, so one wonders what the real motivation behind this push is. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Queensland Government is preparing a business case seeking substantial Federal funding for Gold Coast Light Rail Stage 4 (GCLR4) from Burleigh Heads to Coolangatta. We petitioners consider that rapidly escalating construction costs and alternative, far cheaper, more sustainable technologies have overtaken light rail as the preferred public transport options for the southern Gold Coast. At an estimated cost of $3 billion, servicing a far lower density population catchment than GCLR Stages 1, 2 and 3, we consider GCLR Stage 4 offers extraordinarily poor value for money.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We are concerned the Queensland Government business case (which is not a public document) will not properly evaluate alternative mode options such as zero emission buses and Brisbane Metro trackless trams.

Type 2 diabetes is also a chronic condition &amp; some type 2 diabetics also require the use of insulin !! A fact that every one seems to ignore , good diabetes control is also essential for a type 2 to lead a healthy life in order to delay long term side affects of this disease . Hypo unawareness can occur for many diabetic people and this can be fatal. Having access to CGM means that hypo's are picked up and sound an alarm to alert the diabetic person, Particularly night time lows . CGM can save lives. All Diabetics that are Insulin dependent, need this valuable tool to help deal with a chronic progressive disease. Extending access to fully subsidised CGM for ALL Insulin dependent diabetics would make a huge difference to all those using insulin.

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of Grandmothers for Refugees and certain other citizens of Australia draws the following to the attention of the House: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">• Australia has a duty of care to ALL of the 30,000 desperate people in Australia seeking asylum (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals, Legacy Caseload, and Transitory Persons); </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">• Between 9000 and 12,000 have been excluded from processes announced in 2023 to grant permanent protection and freedom to settle in Australia. Over 100 still remain trapped in PNG and Nauru; some have been there for 10 years. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">• Many of these people claim that decision-making on their immediate future following arrival in Australia was inconsistent, with some being sent offshore, and others arriving on the same boat staying in Australia. Others have been denied permanency based on a decision made using the now discredited fast track system or are still waiting to have their claims for refugee status processed. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to: 1. Affirm Australia's duty of care to ALL of the about 30,000 people who came by boat seeking asylum in Australia (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals, Legacy Caseload, and Transitory Persons); 2. Request the Minister for Immigration to acknowledge and explain past discriminatory treatment of people arriving on the same boat when selecting those for offshore processing; and 3. Request the Minister for Immigration to extend the 2023 Resolution of Status process for granting permanent protection to INCLUDE ALL so-called Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals, Legacy Caseload, and Transitory Persons.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Superannuation</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN3932 to the former Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy on the taxation laws relating to Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) insurance payments in superannuation. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Superannuation benefits can generally only be accessed tax free by people who reach age 60 and retire, reflecting the nature of superannuation as a concessionally taxed form of savings designed to provide income in retirement. Whilst concessional treatment is provided to all superannuation benefits, additional special rules apply to TPD payments withdrawn where they are also classified as disability benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Disability benefit payments made as superannuation income streams before a person's preservation age attract a 15 per cent taxation offset to reduce the normal personal marginal tax rate. Such payments made as superannuation lump sums can have their tax-free component increased to reflect the proportion of the total service period that remains unused because of the disability, recognising the period the recipient could have expected to be employed if the disability had not occurred.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where a person has more than one superannuation account and decides voluntarily to consolidate those accounts, the calculation of the tax-free component for disability benefits uses the earlier total service period of all accounts, and this can result in a lower increase in that component. In addition, as with all merged superannuation accounts, the taxation components are aggregated in the remaining account and these new proportions are used in calculating the components that apply for benefit payment taxation purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These outcomes can also occur if a person's superannuation accounts are consolidated under measures implemented by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Act 2019</span>. This included the transfer of accounts with balances below $6,000 which have not received a contribution or rollover for 16 months to the ATO to protect that account from further erosion by fees and charges. The ATO then proactively reunites that inactive, low balance superannuation account with an individual's active account where possible or makes payments directly to the individual if they are over 65 years of age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst I acknowledge these events can lead to less favourable taxation outcomes in certain circumstances, these policy settings are intended to guard against the undue erosion of superannuation balances through excessive fees and inappropriate insurance arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 referring to me for response, petition EN4361 relating to the Member for Cook, Mr Scott Morrison MP. The petition asks the House to 'put Mr Morrison to the High Court to determine if he can be removed from parliament for being a citizen of New Zealand and to consider pressing criminal charges for signing a false declaration to nominate'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The House adopted a resolution on 4 April 2019 concerning Members' qualifications with respect to sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution. Relevantly, section 44 of the Constitution provides for disqualification of a person to sit as a Senator or Member for certain reasons, including citizenship of a foreign power. The resolution, titled 'Members' qualifications' is available on the Parliament's website at the following address:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">https://www.aph.gov.au/About Parliament/House of Representatives/Powers practice and procedure/resolutions</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to requiring Members to provide statements and supplementary material regarding their qualification under the Constitution, the resolution sets out a process by which the House may deal with any question concerning a Member's qualification. The process provides for a Member to refer certain circumstances to the Speaker, and for the Speaker to report the matter to the House. A motion may then be moved to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests for inquiry and report. The Committee may recommend that the matter be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns under section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and such a referral would then be subject to a decision of the House.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the resolution provides that any question concerning a Member's qualification under the Constitution may be dealt with only in accordance with these procedures, and not otherwise. It also provides that any false statements or omissions under the resolution may be regarded as a serious contempt of the House. However, these are internal processes of the House, limited by the terms of the resolution. Consideration of any criminal charges in relation to false or misleading information in a nomination for election to the House of Representatives would be a matter for the Australian Electoral Commission and the Australian Federal Police.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The obligation for the Speaker to say prayers each day as well as the form of the prayers themselves, are set out in the standing orders.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Changes to the standing orders have arisen in response to inquiries and recommendation made by the Procedure Committee and its predecessor, the Standing Orders Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 1972 the Standing Orders Committee considered a submission from a Member which suggested a different form of prayer, and that prayers once a week would suffice. The committee agreed that there should be no change either in the frequency of offering prayers or in their content. When the Procedure Committee reviewed the standing orders in 2002-2003, partly with a view to modernising the language, the committee made no recommendation in relation to the prayers and the revised standing orders adopted in 2004 retained the original wording.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Clare O'Neil MP, concerning EN4377 calling for a review to identify a plan to mitigate major floods in the New South Wales area. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister for the Environment and Water, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government invests in nationally significant water infrastructure through the National Water Grid Fund. The Government is also investing in disaster resilience, including through the Disaster Ready Fund and Emergency Response Fund.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Notwithstanding the Australian Government's role as a significant investor in water infrastructure, the New South Wales Government is responsible for regional water planning, as well as the construction, operation, and regulation of water infrastructure assets in New South Wales.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Last month, the New South Wales Government decided not to proceed with raising the Warragamba Dam wall and will instead build levies and improve evacuation routes and emergency communications in the Hawkesbury-Nepean.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will work closely with the New South Wales Government to develop flood mitigation solutions across the state.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the Committee for bringing this matter to the Australian Government's attention. I apologise my response falls outside the 90-day response timeframe as there was a delay in the transfer of this petition.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Petition number: EN4629, calling for a national Public Inquiry into Australian Government handling of future health pandemics. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has well established arrangements in place to respond quickly and effectively to a range of health emergencies. These arrangements are set out in health sector emergency management plans, which are designed to integrate with broader national emergency plans, particularly the Government Crisis Management Framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has world-class public health systems, and we are well-prepared to respond to communicable disease challenges. Australia works closely with the World Health Organisation to ensure that it aligns with One Health activities across the suite of pandemic prevention, preparedness and response as part of its obligations under the International Health Regulations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be informed by leading experts, including the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Comprised of all state and territory Chief Health Officers and chaired by the Australian Chief Medical Officer, the AHPPC works with state and territory health departments to develop and adopt national health protection policies, guidelines, standards and seek alignment of plans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 30 June 2022, the Government commissioned an independent review of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine and treatment procurements. In September 2022, the review, led by Professor Jane Halton AO, handed down eight recommendations. The Government responded to the review in February 2023, accepting seven of the eight recommendations in full. The remaining recommendation, relating to the National Medical Stockpile, was partially accepted noting it was largely outside the terms of reference for the review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, has indicated the Government will undertake, at an appropriate future time, an inquiry into Australia's COVID-19 response that will examine the impact of the pandemic and the respective actions of governments. I also note all states and territories, except the Northern Territory, have conducted, or are in the process of conducting, parliamentary inquiries into their COVID-19 responses. The timing of any National Inquiry must be well considered, noting Australia is still experiencing COVID-19, with heightened risk during winter months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has provided $3.2 million for preparatory work to establish an Australian Centre for Disease Control (CDC) which will enhance Australia's ongoing response and preparedness for current and emerging public health emergencies. Once established, the CDC will ensure ongoing pandemic preparedness, lead the federal response to future disease outbreaks, and work to prevent both non-communicable (chronic) and communicable (infectious) diseases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following completion of a targeted consultation process in late 2022, stakeholder feedback is currently being used to inform the Department of Health and Aged Care's advice to Government on the proposed CDC model, including its scope and remit. A staged rollout of the CDC is planned to commence in early 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additional information on the establishment of the Australian CDC, including a summary of consultation feedback, is available on the department's website at www.health.gov.au/our-work/Australian-CDC.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring petition EN4658 about the examination of federal elections and compulsory voting. I respond as the Special Minister of State, responsible for electoral matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Labor Party has led legislation for federal electoral reform in Australia. Reforms by the Hawke Government in the 1980s provided the framework for Australia's contemporary elections and our democracy. Importantly, that Government transformed our democratic institutions with the creation of the independent Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to conduct and oversee elections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition requests an inquiry into elections, particularly in relation to the integrity of elections. The Government is committed to strengthening the integrity of our electoral system and considers voter confidence and scrutiny entitlements in election processes imperative to the functioning of our democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The count process is detailed, with the scrutiny held over a number of weeks. This is to ensure that Australians can have confidence in the outcome of elections. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 </span>(Electoral Act) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984</span> (Referendum Act) contain legislative safeguards to support the integrity of the Australian electoral system, including processes for checks and balances on the scrutiny, which involves the AEC conducting an initial sorting of pre-poll votes, scrutiny on voting night and fresh scrutiny. The progress of these scrutinies is progressively published on the AEC Tally Room, which is available online at https://results.aec.gov.au/27966/Website/HouseDefault-27966.htm.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting the integrity of Australia's electoral processes is critical to maintaining public trust in Australia's democratic processes. The Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) was established for the 2022 Federal Election to provide information and advice to the Electoral Commissioner on matters that may compromise the real or perceived integrity of the federal election. The EIAT is made up of relevant agencies across federal government working together within their own remits. More information on the EIAT is available at: https://www.aec.gov.au/about_aec/electoral-integrity.htm.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, ahead of the 2022 Federal Election, the AEC re-established their 'Stop and Consider Campaign', which builds on the success of a similar campaign run at the 2019 federal election that aims to help voters cut through mis- and disinformation. The AEC also established a disinformation register that lists prominent pieces of disinformation regarding the election process, detailing when the communication was brought to the AEC's attention and actions taken.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 5 August 2022, I wrote to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) asking that they inquire into all aspects of the 2022 federal election. JSCEM will consider the integrity of the federal electoral system and any matters concerning the integrity of the 2022 federal election. I am looking forward to receiving the Committee's report about its investigations, and its recommendations. On receipt I will be engaging with parliamentarians and others who operate in our electoral system to seek their views on proposed electoral reform. Information about the inquiry, including its Terms of Reference, are available at:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the petition requests the abolition of compulsory voting. Compulsory voting is the cornerstone of Australian democracy. As you would be aware, the Electoral Act and the Referendum Act require all eligible Australian citizens to enrol and vote at each election and referendum. Compulsory voting has been part of Australian federal elections since 1924. The Government supports compulsory voting as it strengthens our democratic process and ensures that the vast majority of citizens actively participate in elections.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding petition number EN4670 calling for a Commonwealth Royal Commission into the COVID-19 Pandemic response in Australia and an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into the violation of human rights on a federal, territory and state basis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has well established arrangements in place to respond quickly and effectively to a range of health emergencies. These arrangements are set out in health sector emergency management plans, which are designed to integrate with broader national emergency plans, particularly the Australian Government Crisis Management Framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has world-class public health systems, and we are well-prepared to respond to communicable disease challenges. Australia works closely with the World Health Organization to ensure that it aligns with One Health activities across the suite of pandemic prevention, preparedness and response as part of its obligations under the International Health Regulations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be informed by leading experts, including the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Comprised of all state and territory Chief Health Officers and chaired by the Australian Chief Medical Officer, the AHPPC works with state and territory health departments to develop and adopt national health protection policies, guidelines, standards and seek alignment of plans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 30 June 2022, the Government commissioned an independent review of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine and treatment procurements. In September 2022, the review, led by Professor Jane Halton AO, handed down eight recommendations. The Government responded to the review in February 2023, accepting seven of the eight recommendations in full. The remaining recommendation, relating to the National Medical Stockpile, was partially accepted noting it was largely outside the terms of reference for the review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, has indicated the Government will undertake, at an appropriate future time, an inquiry into Australia's COVID-19 response that will examine the impact of the pandemic and the respective actions of governments. I also note all states and territories, except the Northern Territory, have conducted, or are in the process of conducting, parliamentary inquiries into their COVID-19 responses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The timing of any national inquiry must be well considered, noting Australia is still experiencing COVID-19, with heightened risk during winter months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has provided $3.2 million for preparatory work to establish an Australian Centre for Disease Control (CDC) which will enhance Australia's ongoing response and preparedness for current and emerging public health emergencies. Once established, the CDC will ensure ongoing pandemic preparedness, lead the federal response to future disease outbreaks, and work to prevent both non-communicable (chronic) and communicable (infectious) diseases. Following completion of a targeted consultation process in late 2022, stakeholder feedback is currently being used to inform the Department of Health and Aged Care's advice to Government on the proposed CDC model, including its scope and remit. A staged rollout of the CDC is planned to commence in early 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additional information on the establishment of the Australian CDC, including a summary of consultation feedback, is available on the department's website at www.health.gov.au/our-work/Australian-CDC.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 enclosing Petition EN4709, with 19 signatures, concerning government services eligibility and residential property acquisition for Skilled Work Regional (Provisional) (subclass 491) visa and Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional (Provisional) (subclass 494) visa holders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the important role Skilled Regional Provisional visa holders play in supporting regional economies, employers and communities.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Holders of subclass 491 and subclass 494 visas are able to apply for the Permanent Residence (Skilled Regional) (subclass 191) visa in the Regional Provisional stream after three years, provided they meet the eligibility criteria for that visa (including having complied with the conditions of their skilled regional visa). Once granted, this visa would provide access to government payments, services and benefits available to Australian permanent residents, subject to any waiting periods that may apply.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Skilled Regional Provisional visa holders as temporary residents may seek to acquire an interest in residential land; however, the specific proposals raised in the petition are complex matters.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The primary purpose of the Student visa program is to facilitate the arrival of international students to live and study in Australia temporarily, in order to obtain a high quality education. There is no pathway to permanent residence for international students. Following their studies, however, Student visa holders may seek to apply for a further stay in Australia, either temporarily or permanently, subject to meeting eligibility criteria.</span>

International students who have completed a bachelor's degree or higher, a diploma, an advanced diploma, or a trade qualification undertaken at an Australian educational institution are awarded additional points towards meeting the criteria for certain permanent Skilled visas.

              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the Petition signees' request to increase the Medicare rebate to encourage appropriate remuneration for GPs and to encourage bulk billing. Strengthening Medicare is a top priority for the Australian Government. On 3 February 2023, I was pleased to release the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce (Taskforce) report, developed by primary health care leaders and experts in their fields. The report supports the Government's vision for a stronger Medicare, designed and funded for the 21st cent1,1ry. In addition to the $2.9 billion investment we made in primary care in the 2022-23 October Budget, the Government has committed $750 million to the Strengthening Medicare Fund, which will be the next stage of the major revamp of the primary care system.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Patient-centred care is central to the recommendations of the report, supported by an expansion of multidisciplinary care as the key to managing the health of an older population with more complex and chronic disease. The report recommends supporting this with new blended funding models, integrated with the existing fee-for-service model, allowing teams of GPs, nurses, midwives, and allied health professionals to work together to deliver the care people need. The Taskforce noted that by introducing funding reforms that better reward providers for providing quality, person-centred models of care, we can also position primary care as a career of choice for health professionals, including medical, allied health, nursing and midwifery graduates.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is responsible for setting Medicare fees and rebates, GPs operate their practices as private businesses and are free to determine whether they bulk bill some or all of their patients or charge a co-payment. Nonetheless, the Government remains committed to ensuring Australians can access high quality and affordable health care and supports both free and subsidised health care services. This includes providing Medicare benefits (rebates) for privately rendered services listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and free hospital services for public patients in public hospitals. Any changes to the MBS will be considered through the 2023-24 Budget and future Budget processes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides a bulk billing incentive for bulk billed services for patients with a Commonwealth Concession Card and children under 16 years of age.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that unforeseen out-of-pocket expenses can add to the distress of those who suffer serious or unexpected illnesses and provides assurance to patients who incur high out-of-pocket medical expenses through both the Original Medicare Safety Net and the Extended Medicare Safety Net. Where possible, patients are also encouraged to select an appropriate health provider based on their health care and financial needs.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports the development of the GP workforce through fully funded training programs, including the Australian General Practice Training (AGPT) program. The AGPT program has a yearly intake of 1,500 training places and provides registrars with medical education and training placements to support their learning towards GP fellowship. As part of the AGPT program, support payments are provided to registrars, supervisors and practices. The AGPT program is delivered by both the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine. The department is continuing to work closely with the colleges on GP attraction strategies.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that bringing the employment conditions for GP registrars into closer alignment with those of hospital-based registrars could have a positive impact on the career choices of doctors in training. Following the October 2022 Budget announcement to establish 10 new Single Employer Model trials, I wrote to each of my state and Northern Territory counterparts to invite them to establish single employer model trials in their state.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also progressing a project that is exploring the options for a portability scheme for GP registrars' employment entitlements. A portability scheme would allow GP registrars to transfer and retain employment entitlements as they rotate through GP practices during training.</span>

It identifies achievable, practical actions to build a sustainable, highly trained medical workforce. This includes actions to attract medical students and doctors in raining into career pathways of specialties in undersupply, including general practice; rebalance the number of trainees in oversupplied specialties; and support workforce retention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC is an essential service and is a trusted source of news, information and entertainment for all Australians. In the face of political, social and economic instability at home and abroad, we must ensure that Australia's instruments of nation building, democracy and culture remain strong now and into the future. This includes independent public service media that holds power to account on behalf of the Australian people.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC is government-funded but has operational and editorial independence so that its programs may be free of political and commercial interference.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is essential to bolster the independence and stability of the national broadcasters as a guard against political interference in Australia's democratic institutions. This is why the Government has committed to providing the ABC with five-year funding terms, which will increase funding certainty outside the electoral cycle. Increased funding stability will improve the capacity of the national broadcaster to innovate as well as plan ahead with the diverse ecosystems the ABC supports, including across education, screen production and international broadcasting.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to better funding for the ABC, the Government will review options for delivering a greater level of financial stability and certainty to the national broadcasters to safeguard against arbitrary ideological cuts and political interference. This review will be informed by the findings of the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee inquiry into allegations of political interference to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 6 March 2023, concerning the petition relating to social welfare payments for cancer patients (EN4653). I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is strongly committed to an income support system that operates as a safety net for people who need it most while ensuring the system remains sustainable for Australian taxpayers. The Disability Support Pension (DSP) is an income support payment available for people who are unable to work at least 15 hours a week due to a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment, for at least the next 2 years, and the level of their impairment is such that it attracts at least 20 points under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tables for the assessment of work- related impairment for Disability Support Pension</span> (the Impairment Tables).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Eligibility for DSP is based on the functional impairment, which results from a person's medical condition, and how this impacts their ability to work, rather than on diagnosis or specific medical conditions alone. People with cancer may be eligible for the DSP, depending on their individual circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Impairment Tables are designed to assess a person's loss of functional capacity that affects their ability to work. The Department of Social Services undertook a review of the previous DSP Impairment Tables legislative instrument prior to its expiry on 1 April 2023. The review included extensive public consultation with disability peak bodies, advocacy groups, people with lived experience of the DSP process and medical professionals to gather feedback on the previous Tables.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new Impairment Tables came into effect on 1 April 2023 and aim to clarify requirements, including that a person's condition must be diagnosed, reasonably treated and stabilised, and the resulting impairment of their condition must, more likely than not, persist for more than 2 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of the review, and in consultation with cancer and oncology experts, changes were also made to better represent cancer, by incorporating references to specific types of cancer and their functional impacts as examples of conditions and impairments which may be considered under relevant Tables. Changes were also made to acknowledge the ongoing impacts of side effects from prescribed medication and treatments, such as chemotherapy, by adding overarching guidance stating consideration should be given to an impairment resulting from these treatments when selecting the appropriate Table/s for assessment, and subsequently assessing the impairment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In certain circumstances a claim for DSP can be granted manifestly. This means that on the basis of medical evidence alone the person is considered eligible for DSP. This may include a person who has a condition that has a life expectancy of less than 2 years (e.g. terminal cancer).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While a condition may not meet these requirements for the resulting impairment to be considered for DSP, this does not mean the condition is not understood to be serious. Some people found ineligible for DSP would be eligible for activity test exemptions under another income support payment, such as JobSeeker Payment, due to the current state of their health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When a person claiming or receiving the JobSeeker Payment is diagnosed with cancer or another serious illness, the severity of their condition can determine if they are eligible for a serious illness temporary incapacity exemption from mutual obligation requirements. This can be granted for up to 52 weeks, based on the dates indicated on a single medical certificate. Where the same serious illness persists, an additional period of exemption of up to 6 months can be considered based on further medical evidence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JobSeeker recipients with cancer may also be referred for an Employment Services Assessment to have their work capacity assessed by a health professional. If the person is determined to have a Partial Capacity to Work their mutual obligation requirements will be reduced in line with their assessed work capacity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioner may be referring to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements (Guidelines for Determining Whether Income Stream is Asset-test Exempt) Determination 2022 (Determination)</span>, registered on 20 October 2022. Consistent with longstanding practice, section 18 of the Determination allows the Repatriation Commission (Commission) to determine that an income stream is an asset-test exempt income stream for the purposes of the VEA if, relevantly, the Commission is satisfied that 'the income stream is a defined benefit income stream, and has been so from the day the income stream began being paid'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission has determined that DFRDB is an income stream that is asset-test exempt, on the basis that it is a defined benefit income stream and has been from commencement.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, defined benefit income streams such as the DFRDB are still subject to the income test under the VEA. The application of the income test can lead to a reduction in the rate of pension payable to a veteran and their partner if applicable, if their income is higher than a prescribed threshold. This is so even though the DFRDB entitlement is not taken into account under the asset-test itself.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the circumstances, I do not consider it is necessary for the House to take any additional action in response to Parliamentary Petition EN4659, because DFRDB is already considered to be asset-test exempt.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 14 March 2023 to the Hon Mark Butler MP, Minister for Health and Aged Care, regarding Petition EN4705.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition EN4705 is requesting for publicly funded psychiatric and psychological assessments that have been ordered by the court in family law cases, and for such assessments to be treated as a matter of urgency.</span>

                <span style="font-style:italic;">The Family Law Act 1975</span> enables the family law courts to order expert reports where expert evidence is required to assist in the resolution of proceedings. Expe1i witnesses in family law matters include psychologists, social workers, child and family psychiatrists, medical specialists and treating practitioners. These expe1is may provide evidence to the court on matters within their area of expe1iise. For example, a psychologist or psychiatrist may provide evidence where mental health issues are raised, or an addiction specialist may provide evidence in matters where parental substance misuse is to be considered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Experts may also provide evidence through a 'family report', which is a professional forensic assessment unde1iaken to assist a court and/or the parties decide on parenting arrangements for children of separated parents or caregivers. It is an independent, professional forensic appraisal of the family, done from a social science perspective. The assessment provides information about the needs of children and their relationships with their parents and other significant adults and the parental capacities of the adults with regard to the children's needs.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 6 March 2023 regarding Petition EN4736.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Child sexual abuse is an abhorrent and pervasive crime that requires a strong criminal justice response. I appreciate the Petitioner's concerns about the safety and wellbeing of Australia's children. The Australian Government remains committed to protecting children from sexual abuse and ensuring Australia's criminal justice response adequately reflects the profound harm caused to victims and survivors, and to communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While states and territories have primary responsibility to legislate on matters related to child sexual abuse within their jurisdiction, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995</span> (Cth) includes a world-leading framework of offences relating to child sexual abuse and dealings with child abuse material committed via a carriage service (such as a mobile phone or the Internet), via a postal service, and by Australian citizens and residents while overseas. Under this framework, offenders who commit ce1tain child sexual abuse offences may face up to 30 years' imprisonment. Furthermore, the framework includes mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious child sexual abuse offences and repeat offenders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Office for Child Safety (National Office) was announced as part of the Australian Government Response to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and was established on 1 July 2018. The National Office sits within my Department and provides national leadership, working across governments and sectors, to deliver policies and strategies to enhance children's safety and reduce future harm to children, with a particular focus on child sexual abuse.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 27 October 2021, the Australian Government launched the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Child Sexual Abuse</span> (2021-2030) (National Strategy). The National Strategy is a 10-year, whole-of-nation framework to establish a coordinated and consistent approach to preventing and better responding to child sexual abuse in all settings. The National Strategy is informed by a public health framework, and recognises that everyone—individuals, families, communities, organisations, governments—has a role to play in protecting children and young people, generating cultural change, and empowering and supporting victims and survivors. Implementation of the National Strategy is led by the National Office.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support its implementation, the Government has invested an initial $307.5 million for the National Strategy's first four years from 2021-22 to 2024-25.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 21 March 2023 enclosing Petition EN4765, with three signatures, concerning the request to remove section 48 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span> (the Act) for Student and work visa applicants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In accordance with s48 of the Act, in certain circumstances, a person who is in Australia, and who does not hold a substantive visa, can validly apply only for certain visas if they have had a substantive visa application refused or a visa cancelled since last arriving in Australia. The limitation on applications under s48 prevents repeat or successive visa applications being made by a person who is trying to delay departure from Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regulation 2.12 of the Migration Regulations 1994 prescribes the list of visa subclasses to which s48 of the Act does not apply, therefore allowing the person to lodge an application for the visa subclasses listed. This list includes, among others, some Skilled Work visas, some Family visas, Protection visas and Bridging visas; however, it does not include Student visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Except in certain circumstances (such as a person who has been removed from Australia), a person who has departed Australia can apply for a Student or work visa to travel to and remain in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN4765 to my attention. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges that tick-borne illnesses cause considerable morbidity in Australia. These illnesses include Queensland tick typhus, Flinders Island spotted fever, Australian spotted fever and Q fever which are all caused by transmission of rickettsia bacteria by ticks to humans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there are no specific Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items for infection associated with tick bites (this is a feature of MBS—e.g., there are not specific items for infections like Japanese encephalitis which is associated with mosquito bites), items which facilitate consultations are used to diagnose and treat patients with Australian endemic tick-borne diseases. Using clinical judgement and experience, Australian healthcare providers can diagnose and treat Australian endemic tick-borne diseases or provide referrals to specialists for more complex cases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Tick bite diagnoses are challenging as clinical features can be similar to many other diseases. Consultation with appropriate experts in vector-borne diseases including specialist microbiologists with diagnostic experience and infectious disease physicians for treatment of diagnosed vector-borne diseases is recommended.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicare operates with GPs as the gatekeepers for referrals for specialist pathologist and consultant physician services that would include patients with tick-borne illnesses. The MBS items are designed to promote flexibility and responsiveness.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lyme disease is commonly found in parts of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Asia. Visitors to these areas can become infected and return to Australia with Lyme disease. Australian healthcare providers can readily diagnose and treat Lyme disease in patients bitten by a tick in Lyme disease-endemic areas. All confirmed Lyme disease cases to date have been in returned travellers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the bacteria that cause Lyme disease overseas, <span style="font-style:italic;">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>, has not been identified in Australian ticks despite multiple studies that have searched for it. For this reason, the Government does not support the diagnosis of locally acquired Lyme disease. Locally acquired Lyme disease is also not generally accepted by the Australian medical profession.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian infectious diseases physicians receive training that includes the management of classical Lyme disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the absence of epidemiological evidence (such as overseas travel to a Lyme endemic area) pointing towards a high pre-test probability, testing for Lyme disease is not generally accepted by the Australian medical profession as necessary for the appropriate management of the patient and therefore not clinically relevant. A confirmed case of Lyme disease in Australia requires laboratory, clinical and epidemiological evidence.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not collect information on the nature of specific referrals by infectious disease specialists, therefore, statistical record-keeping by the Government for all tick-borne infections definitively acquired in Australia is at present not feasible or practical.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to correspondence of 31 March 2022 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, enclosing Petition EN3882, with 251 signatures, concerning a request to process on hand subclass 887 Skilled Regional visa applications in chronological order. This correspondence has now been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the number of on hand visa applications is a priority for the Australian Government. On 1 and 2 September 2022 at the Jobs and Skills Summit, the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon Clare O'Neil MP made a range of announcements including $36.1M to fund an extra 500 positions that have been supporting temporary and migration visa processing undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs to reduce on-hand visa applications. Good progress has been made, and as at 31 March 2023, the Department had finalised almost four times more applications for Skilled—Regional (Provisional and Permanent) visas (subclasses 489, 491 and 887), when compared to the same period in 2021-22.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of the significant backlog of subclass 887 visa applications that existed until recent months. The subclass 887 visa is the second stage of a two stage visa, which is available to people who already hold an eligible provisional visa and who are already working and living in regional Australia. All applicants for the subclass 887 visa, that apply while in Australia, are granted a bridging visa that allows them to continue to reside and work in Australia, until their subclass 887 visa is decided.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Skilled migration visa applications are processed according to priorities set through Ministerial Direction 100. Priority is given to applicants from outside Australia to encourage them to enter Australia and join the labour force. As subclass 887 visa applications are not made in relation to a specific occupation they are accorded  a lower order of priority under this Direction.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to the introduction of Ministerial Direction 100, subclass 887 visa applications were not subject to any priority processing. Ministerial Direction 100 came into effect on 28 October 2022 and replaced both Ministerial Direction 96 and 97, which were in place from 4 April 2022. Neither Ministerial Direction 96 nor 97, applied to the subclass 887 visa, which meant that they were afforded no priority and were only processed after all other visas listed under these directions.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Ministerial Direction 100 assists in reducing processing times across caseloads and allows the Department to consider applications which were not prioritised under the previous directions, including subclass 887 visa applications.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department is undertaking a range of measures to reduce the processing times for this type of application, and additional resources have been assigned to the caseload. I am pleased to advise that the Department has significantly reduced the subclass 887 visa backlog, by granting more than 15,000 applicants since 1 January 2023.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to correspondence of 31 March 2022 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, enclosing Petition EN3920, with 5,349 signatures, concerning the release of Mr Mehdi Ali and other transitory persons from immigration detention. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the time of this petition, many transitory persons brought to Australia for a temporary purpose to receive medical treatment were detained, notably in</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">alternative places of detention, including hotels, often for extended periods. Some transitory persons brought to Australia under the medevac provisions in 2019 were detained for more than 2.5 years pending completion of their medical treatment,</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">a return to a regional processing country, or a departure from Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since May 2022, the current Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, and I, have reviewed the circumstances of individuals in held detention to ensure detention is proportional, lawful and remains necessary. We have asked the Department of Home Affairs to refer cases for our respective public interest intervention powers consideration. Home Affairs Portfolio Ministers have personal intervention powers under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span>, which allow them to grant a visa to a person, if they think it is in the public interest to do so. The personal intervention powers are non-compellable, that is, the Ministers are not required to exercise their power. Further, what is in the public interest is a matter for the Ministers to determine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This action is not only a more humane approach to managing transitory persons temporarily in Australia, but ensures that immigration detention is used only where necessary and that alternatives to detention are prioritised for individuals who do not present a risk to the Australian public.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As reported in the media, Mr Ali was released from immigration detention in March 2022, and has subsequently resettled in the United States.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to delivering orderly and legal pathways to Australia through robust migration and humanitarian programs. While a humane approach to irregular migration is required, we must also ensure that new people smuggling ventures do not reach our shores. As such, the Government has committed to maintaining strong border protection measures, including regional processing, and is upholding the policy setting that individuals who attempt to travel to Australia irregularly by boat will not settle in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Equally, the Government is focused on finding durable migration outcomes for transitory persons under regional processing and continues to support the implementation of third country resettlement arrangements with the United States and New Zealand, and providing logistical support to independent resettlement options, such as private sponsorship in Canada. Third country resettlement provides the best available opportunity for individuals to achieve permanent migration outcomes and start the next phase of their lives. Transitory persons are strongly encouraged to engage with available migration options and can access support to help them connect with their options.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to correspondence of 31 March 2022 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs enclosing Petition EN3933, with 162 signatures, concerning "Indefinite detention of refugees". As the current Minister for Home Affairs and Cyber Security your correspondence has been referred to me as this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Migration Act 1958 (the Act), detention is not limited by a set timeframe; rather, it ends when the person is either granted a visa or is removed from Australia. This is dependent upon a number of factors, including identity determination, developments in country information and the complexity of processing due to individual circumstances relating to health, character or security matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act creates a statutory framework regulating the entry and stay of non-citizens in Australia. Under the Act, non-citizens who do not hold a visa are liable for detention. The duration and conditions of immigration detention are subject to regular review by senior officers of the Department of Home Affairs, as well as the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian Human Rights Commission.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The most common reasons individuals are in detention for extended periods of time are national security risks or serious criminality, unresolved identity, or health issues that cannot be managed in the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Immigration detention is used as a last resort. Whenever possible, unlawful non-citizens are accommodated in the community or in less restrictive alternative places of detention, in particular where children are involved. Detainees have access to appropriate food (accommodating specific medical, dietary and cultural requirements), educational programs, cultural, recreational and sporting activities, internet and computer facilities, televisions, and clean, comfortable sleeping quarters.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitory persons in Nauru are not detained and are living and working in the Nauruan community. They have ongoing access to health and welfare services, including mental health, delivered by a multi-disciplinary team of health practitioners, including general practitioners, nurses and counselling specialists. Specialist health services include psychology, psychiatry, dentistry, obstetrics, radiography and pharmaceutical services are also available. Where clinically indicated specialist medical treatment is not available in Nauru, mechanisms are in place for temporary transfer to a third country for assessment and treatment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I can assure you that the Government is committed to finding durable migration outcomes for individuals under regional processing and we continue to support the implementation of third country resettlement arrangements with the United States and New Zealand. Over 1,080 individuals have already resettled in the United States, as well as 13 individuals in New Zealand, with a sizeable number pursuing New Zealand as a resettlement pathway. The Government is also aware of transitory persons exploring private sponsorship in Canada and is providing logistical interview and travel assistance to Canada to progress these cases.</span>

Individuals are strongly encouraged to engage with available migration options. Third country resettlement provides the best available opportunity for individuals to build a path to a new life.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 enclosing Petition EN4327, with two signatures, concerning the impact of COVID-19 on temporary visa holders and pathways to permanent residency for temporary visa holders. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Skilled migrants play an important role in nation building, cultural diversity and social cohesion, as well as contributing significant economic benefits. The Skilled visa programs are designed to ensure that overseas workers supplement but do not displace Australian workers. Australia's universal, non-discriminatory migration programs are designed to support a safe, prosperous and united Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Temporary Skills Shortage (TSS) visa program is the primary mechanism for temporary skilled workers to Australia. The program is intended to be flexible and responsive to the economic cycle in line with employer demand to fill genuine vacancies where an Australian worker is not available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2022, legislative changes were made to enable a pathway to permanent residence for:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is a special concession recognising those highly skilled migrant workers who chose to stay in Australia throughout the pandemic, while continuing to address Australia's acute shortages. This allows them to stay here, with a pathway to Australian citizenship.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 February 2023, the Department of Home Affairs advised that this pathway is also available to Medium-term stream TSS visa holders with an occupation on the Regional Occupation List.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 enclosing Petition EN4352, with five signatures, concerning Processing Time Standard for Australian Border Force (ABF).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABF is Australia's frontline border law enforcement agency, responsible for protecting Australia's border and enabling legitimate travel and trade. This role requires the ABF to respond to a diverse range of border risks including illicit drugs, firearms, explosives, chemical and biological agents, drug precursors, child exploitation material, goods which breach intellectual property laws, revenue evasion, and goods that do not meet accepted health or safety standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To deliver on this responsibility, the ABF risk assesses all cargo entering Australia, and where appropriate may place a hold on border clearance to enable further investigation. This investigation may include requests for additional documentation or physical inspection by ABF officers. Given the broad spectrum of risks and types of goods involved, it is not possible or practical to implement a specific timeframe for processing and release of this cargo. It is also not possible to provide details of why cargo has been held, as to do' so may compromise ongoing operational activity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 186 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Act 1901</span> specifies that the expense of any examination of goods subject to customs control will be borne by the goods owner. Therefore, while the ABF seeks to minimise the impact of cargo interventions on legitimate trade by completing risk assessment and intervention activities as soon as possible, it is important for importers and exporters to make provisions for the possibility their cargo may be held by the ABF for further investigation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on the ABF's role and activities in the import and export environment can be found on the ABF website at: www.abf.gov.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 28 November 2022, regarding petition number EN4508 and the validity period for the Professional Year program, English test scores and the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters' (NAATI) Credentialed Community Language (CCL) test score.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I respect the time taken by the Principal Petitioner, Mr Subramanian Vellayappan, to bring these issues to the Australian Government's attention. I would also like to acknowledge and thank the 49 individuals who took the time to sign it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to using English language requirements in migration legislation as a means to effectively manage immigration risk and ensure visa holders can participate fully in the Australian community. Asking certain visa applicants to provide an English language test score as prescribed in migration law is a reliable and consistent way for the Department to assess an applicant's English language proficiency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also references NAATI, and validity periods relating to CCL test scores. NAATI is an independent non-Government entity and is wholly responsible for setting the validity period for a CCL result. NAATI has confirmed that the expiry date of a pre-existing CCL result cannot be extended, and, if a result has expired, unfortunately the test would need to be taken again.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there are no immediate plans to make changes relating to the issues raised by the Mr Vellayappan in petition number EN4508, I have asked the Department to consider this petition in the context of any future policy reforms that may occur in relation to English language testing at a time in the future.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence originally to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN4582—Identity protection for finance applications. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Australia's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks, reporting entities (which includes credit providers) are obligated to collect information from customers and verify their identity, before commencing a designated service (which includes making a loan). This applies to both regulated and unregulated lenders, provided the loans are made in the course of carrying on a loans business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These identity verification obligations are imposed by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/ITF Act)</span>. The objects of this Act include to detect, deter and disrupt money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and other serious financial crimes. This may include identity theft related financial crimes of the kind referred to by the petitioners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Failures to comply with AML/CTF identity verification obligations may attract significant penalties. The enforcement actions available to the regulator, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), include civil penalty orders, enforceable undertakings, infringement notices and remedial directions. The courts may impose civil penalties orders of up to 20,000 penalty unit per breach for individuals or 100,000 penalty units for body corporates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Credit providers who collect personal data are also generally subject to Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) requirements regarding the collection, use, disclosure, quality and integrity of personal information. In particular, Australian Privacy Principle 11imposes obligations to protect personal information from misuse, interference and loss, and from authorised access, modification or disclosure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It should be noted that in addition to any legal obligations, credit providers are strongly incentivised to ensure that borrowers are who they say they are—in order to avoid financial losses through fraud.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where an individual is concerned that they may be a victim of fraud or identity theft in relation to lending they may, pursuant to Part IIIA of the Privacy Act, initiate a 21-day ban on credit providers or credit reporting bodies using or disclosing the information in their consumer credit report. Accordingly, the ban may prevent credit being extended by limiting credit application assessments for the ban period. Individuals can indefinitely extend this ban period if they are a victim of fraud.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Independent statutory reviews of the credit reporting provisions contained in the Privacy Act and the mandatory credit reporting framework in the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009</span> are due to be completed by October 2024. The reviews will ensure that the credit reporting framework in Australia is fit for purpose, including considering the requirements on credit providers or credit reporting bodies in situations of suspected fraud and misuse, and the effectiveness of credit bans to freeze access to an individual's credit files.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 6 February 2023 to the Hon Andrew Giles MP, Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, enclosing Petition EN4613, with 456 signatures, calling for a change in Australia's asylum seekers policy. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a cohesive, multicultural society of people drawn from a rich variety of cultural backgrounds. The Australian Government knows the important social and economic contribution migrants and refugees have had through our nation's history. The Government is committed to delivering orderly and legal pathways to Australia through robust migration and humanitarian programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While a humane approach to irregular migration is required, we must also ensure that new people smuggling ventures do not reach our shores. As such, the Government has committed to maintaining strong border protection measures, including regional processing. Under this approach, people who attempt to travel to Australia irregularly by boat will not be settled in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is party to the various international human rights treaties, including <span style="font-style:italic;">1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees</span> and its <span style="font-style:italic;">1967 Protocol</span>, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Australia takes its international obligations seriously and is committed to upholding them. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitory persons in Nauru are not detained and are living and working in the Nauruan community. They have ongoing access to health and welfare services, including mental health, delivered by a multi-disciplinary team of health practitioners, including general practitioners, nurses and counselling specialists. Specialist health services include psychology, psychiatry, dentistry, obstetrics, radiography and pharmaceutical services are also available. Where clinically indicated specialist medical treatment is not available in Nauru, mechanisms are in place for temporary transfer to a third country for assessment and treatment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Independent organisations, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have conducted monitoring visits in Nauru.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I assure you the Government is committed to finding durable migration outcomes for individuals under regional processing and we continue to support the implementation of third country resettlement arrangements with the United States and New Zealand. Over 1,080 individuals have already resettled in the United States, as well as 13 individuals in New Zealand, with a sizeable number pursuing New Zealand as a resettlement pathway. The Government is also aware of transitory persons exploring private sponsorship in Canada and is providing logistical interview and travel assistance to Canada to progress these cases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals under regional processing arrangements have lived with uncertainty about their future since they arrived in 2013-14, and resettlement in a third country provides a permanent migration outcome not available here. Individuals are strongly encouraged to engage with available migration options. Third country resettlement provides the best available opportunity for individuals to build a path to a new life.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2023 to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, the Hon Chris Bowen MP, about petition EN4634, funding for supporting soft plastic recycling. Your correspondence has been referred to me as Minister for the Environment and Water, as the matters raised fall within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing and responsibly managing Australia's plastic waste is a priority for the Australian Government. The issues facing soft plastic collection and recycling are unfortunate, but they are temporary. Coles, Woolworths and Aldi have released a roadmap that outlines the pathway to resume in store collection. The roadmap can be found on the supermarkets' websites. Industry has a lead role in improving the sustainability of plastics they use and the government will continue to support them in delivering solutions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to these immediate efforts, I expect industry to look at ways to improve the management of soft plastics into the future. Medium to long term solutions will likely include improved packaging design to ensure packaging materials are easier to recycle, new approaches to how packaging materials are collected and managed, and new technologies to recycle soft plastics back into food grade packaging or other marketable plastic products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is investing $250 million into new and upgraded recycling infrastructure through the Recycling Modernisation Fund (RMF). The additional recycling capacity funded by the RMF supports Australia to regulate the export of waste glass, plastic, tyres, paper and cardboard. The RMF will see over $1 billion of investment in recycling infrastructure, with contributions from the states and territories and industry. RMF projects already announced will add over one million tonnes of processing capacity every year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is investing a further $60 million for a Plastics Technology stream through the RMF. This will support advanced recycling solutions and build Australia's capability to address hard-to-recycle plastics, including soft plastics.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing and responsibly managing Australia's plastic waste is a priority for the Australian Government.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are many factors to be considered in the design and use of plastics to reduce the impact on the environment. While there is increasing interest from industry and consumers about biodegradable plastics, the term biodegradable can be misleading by implying packaging will safely degrade outside of a processing system. Some biodegradable plastics release toxic components into the environment as they degrade, fragmenting or breaking up into microplastics that further contribute to plastic pollution. There is also no requirement for products labelled as biodegradable to specify the conditions and timeframe within which the material must break down.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In contrast, compostable plastic packaging certified to Australian Standard AS4736 or AS5810 must degrade or break down within relatively short timeframes and comply with important quality and ecotoxicity criteria. Certified compostable packaging can also offer value as part of a circular economy as an alternative for single-use plastics for facilitating the recovery of food waste where it is accepted through food organic recovery systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to recognise that there are many circumstances where recyclable plastic packaging will have a preferable outcome over biodegradable or certified compostable packaging. For example, conventional plastic packaging which can be recycled and reused multiple times in new packaging and other products has an improved life cycle outcome over biodegradable plastic which can take years to degrade and cannot be reused.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In October 2022, all Environment Ministers agreed to reform the regulation of packaging by 2025 to ensure that all packaging available in Australia is designed to be recovered, reused, recycled, and reprocessed safely in line with circular economy principles. This reform is an opportunity to mandate obligations for industry and provide a framework to support and monitor industry progress against design and circularity objectives. I am committed to working with industry and the states and territories to address barriers to achieving the targets and to have a new fit-for-purpose regulatory scheme for packaging in place by 2025.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To reduce the environmental impact of soft plastic packaging it is essential that industry both reduces the use of plastic and adopts sustainable design principles. A central pillar of the government's reform of packaging regulation will ensure industry complies with obligations for the sustainable design of soft plastic packaging. These requirements could include the use of mono-materials, an overall reduction of plastic use, only using ink and labels compatible with recycling processes, increasing the use of recycled content, and adopting the Australasian Recycling Label. The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation's Sustainable Packaging Guidelines and the international CEFLEX soft plastics guidelines are currently available to industry as best practice models for soft plastics design.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are committed to upgrading the existing recycling infrastructure for fossil-based plastic. The Australian Government is investing $250 million into new and upgraded recycling infrastructure through the Recycling Modernisation Fund (RMF). The additional recycling capacity funded by the RMF supports Australia to regulate the export of waste glass, plastic, tyres, paper and cardboard. The RMF will see over $1 billion of investment in recycling infrastructure, with contributions from the states and territories and industry. RMF projects already announced will add over one million tonnes of processing capacity every year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is investing a further $60 million for a Plastics Technology stream through the RMF. This will support advanced recycling solutions and build Australia's capability to address hard-to-recycle plastics, including soft plastics.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4651 on the regulation of baby walkers in Australia. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2004, baby walkers were banned in Canada following a broad industry agreement to withdraw and no longer supply these products. Although banned in Canada, a number of countries continued to allow baby walkers to be supplied so long as they met specific safety standards that provide special protections to the infants using those products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, current protections for baby walkers are mandated by <span style="font-style:italic;">the Consumer Protection Notice No. 1 of 2013</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Safety Standard: Baby Walkers</span> under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). This mandatory safety standard requires all baby walkers supplied in Australia to comply with specific design, construction, performance and labelling requirements based on certain sections of the American Society for Testing and Materials' voluntary standard known as <span style="font-style:italic;">ASTM F977-00 Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Infant Walkers</span>. ASTM F977-00 includes requirements that intend to reduce the risk of injury such as braking mechanisms to stop baby walkers from falling down steps or stairs, stability requirements to resist tip-over, and warning requirements pertaining to suitable use and supervision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) periodically reviews bans and mandatory safety standards to ensure they offer appropriate protection. Given the concerns raised in this petition, I will ask the ACCC to consider these issues when they next review the mandatory safety standard for this product. Currently, the ACCC is not considering any proposals for a ban given the requirements of the mandatory safety standard which are designed to address the risks associated with the use of these products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to product-specific regulation, the ACCC has published safety information for consumers, which includes safety tips around supervision and appropriate use, following a coordinated surveillance project with state and territory consumer law regulators. Further guidance for consumers can be found on the Product Safety Australia website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4691 on the HomeBuilder grant document cut-off date. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government understands that matters outside of Australians' control have led to the disruption of the construction industry and supply lines, and as a result has impacted the ability of some existing HomeBuilder applicants to meet the 30 April 2023 deadline for providing supporting documentation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 27 April 2023, I announced that I had signed a revised National Partnership Agreement on HomeBuilder (NPA) on behalf of the Commonwealth. The revised NPA extends the deadline for document submission from 30 April 2023 to 30 June 2025.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This extension will only apply to existing applicants who had entered financial commitments on the basis they would receive the grant but, through no fault of their own, were affected by supply constraints and construction industry delays.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This extension will provide sufficient time for all outstanding applicants to complete the eligibility requirements to receive the HomeBuilder grant. The eligibility requirements for the HomeBuilder program will remain the same.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The revised NPA will apply in a state or territory whose government also signs the revised NPA.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can advise that the following states have signed the revised NPA, and the extended deadline is now in operation in Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, Australian Capital Territory, and Queensland.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4696 on applying tests for the true purpose of money raised during online fund raisers. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's present state and territory fundraising laws were developed at a time when most fundraising was conducted in person. With most fundraising done online, the costs and complexities of complying with multiple state and territory fundraising requirements is a major issue for the charity sector, and uncertainty about the oversight of short term, quickfire fundraising campaigns is a source of confusion for donors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For years, it's been clear we need to fix Australia's outdated fundraising laws. Nationally consistent fundraising regulation has been recommended by several reviews over the past decade, including the 2020 Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements formed in response to the extreme bushfire season of 2019-20.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Earlier this year, I was pleased to announce the first step in modernising our charitable fundraising regulations. The Commonwealth, state and territory Treasurers have agreed to a set of nationally consistent fundraising principles to streamline and harmonise state and territory requirements on charitable fundraiser conduct.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the specific concern raised in Petition EN4696, Australian tax law effectively creates a purpose test for funds raised through online fundraising platforms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Money received through an online fundraising platform is assessable income and liable to income tax if the fundraising is in the course of employment, run in a businesslike way with the intent of making a profit or received in the ordinary course of business. However, if the money received is a genuine gift—for example, to cover a medical procedure for an individual—it will not be assessable income and will not be subject to income tax.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a fundraiser is a charity registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), the charity must be able to show that it uses its income to pursue its charitable purposes. Failure to do so may result in the ACNC revoking its registration which would result in the charity losing its tax exemption.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Other not-for-profit organisations are exempt from income tax only if they apply their income and assets for specific purposes set out in tax law, such as promoting sport. From 2023-24, such organisations will need to prove to the Australian Taxation Office their eligibility for the income tax exemption.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding petition number EN4699, which proposed mandatory requirements for businesses to have an Automated External Defibrillator (AED).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth shares responsibility for work, health and safety (WHS) with the states and territories, with each jurisdiction responsible for implementing, regulating and enforcing their own WHS laws. WHS laws are largely harmonised across these jurisdictions through a set of uniform laws (the model WHS laws, which includes a model Act, model Regulations and model Codes of Practice). All jurisdictions except Victoria have implemented the model WHS laws, and Victoria has similar laws in place. Changes to the model WHS laws require a two-third majority of WHS Ministers to support the changes, after which each jurisdiction is responsible for replicating the changes into their own WHS laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the model WHS laws, persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU), such as an employer, have a duty to ensure that all persons in the workplace, including workers and other persons, are not exposed to health and safety risks. This duty requires risks to health and safety to be eliminated or minimised as far as is reasonably practicable. The model WHS Regulations contain an additional duty on a PCBU to provide first aid, including providing first aid equipment for the workplace. The composition of this equipment is not prescribed, but may include an AED.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The model Codes of Practice provide practical guidance to assist duty holders to meet their requirements under the model WHS laws. In practice, a duty holder must comply with a Code of Practice unless the duty holder has an alternative method of compliance at a standard that is equivalent to or higher than the Code of Practice.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  Since its introduction in the 45th Parliament, petitioners have enthusiastically embraced the House of Representatives e-petition system as an effective way of bringing their issue or concern to the House. Electronic petitions hosted on the parliamentary website allow Australian citizens and residents to easily share and gather support for their petitions across Australia and beyond. Support for electronic petitioning has increased to the point where, in the current parliament to date, more than 97 per cent of petitions presented in the House have been submitted through the e-petition system. However, some petitioners continue to choose pen and paper to bring their requests to the House. One benefit of paper petitions is that they allow petitioners to go out into their communities and engage with people face to face. The process of collecting handwritten signatures provides organisers with an opportunity to discuss the matters raised in the petition and to gauge the level of community support behind an issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, I've presented one that has significant community support. Today I presented a paper petition organised by the community group Grandmothers for Refugees, which is active in many electorates, including in my electorate of Macquarie in New South Wales, Fremantle in Western Australia and Higgins in Victoria. This petition, asking the House to take certain actions to support people seeking asylum in Australia, has gathered 6,556 signatures. These signatures were collected across Australia at community events, markets, shopping centres and coffee shops. I also note that a petition from Grandmothers for Refugees with around 1,800 signatures collected at events during 2022 and 2023, largely within my electorate of Macquarie, wasn't compliant with the petition rules, so I have personally written to the minister, providing details of the request to government on a range of steps the petitioners would like to see. To all the grandmothers involved in this advocacy across the country, I'd like to commend them on an incredible effort.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This figure has undoubtedly increased since that time, given the dramatic growth reported in the interactive gambling sector during COVID and with the advent of people using their phones.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With gambling companies spending $287.2 million on gambling ads in 2022, and an average of 948 gambling advertisements airing per day on free-to-air television alone in Victoria, we have reached saturation point. It is ridiculous.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australians are increasingly targeted by gambling advertising, which is particularly targeted at young people, who are being told to bet with their mates—quirky advertising that's funky and focused on young people. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, young people in particular are reportedly more likely to bet on impulse or gamble more after viewing these ads. These ads are overwhelmingly targeted at them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's pretty sad when we get to a point where kids know all about this. They know about all the apps. They ask their parents if they've got the apps, whether they can place a bet. And a thousand times a day—we are kidding ourselves if we don't think this is causing harm.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to wean governments and sporting codes off their reliance on gambling revenue.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to show some leadership, ban predatory gambling advertising and develop evidence based strategies to treat gambling harm as a public health issue, instead of treating people like cash cows.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look back in time to 1992. That was the time when in this place we banned cigarette advertising. It's a legal product if you're over 18 years of age, but we recognised the public health harm of this. Since then, the major political parties have not accepted donations from cigarette companies. We need to do the same with gambling. We need to see this as an inherent harm, and particularly harming our young people. And it's going to take some courage by government to do this, but I say: let's be like 1992; let's make that have been in this place, because it is equally harmful. It is a public health issue—it's actually a public health emergency. I know there are young people who are harming, who have taken their lives because they've just got so much into debt, or who can't even watch a game of sport anymore for the constant bombardment of advertisements. And it's on all the channels, and that's why this bill will target it, whether it's on free-to-air, on radio, in print or, indeed, on streaming services and social media. We need to make sure that there's no corner that allows this to continue to happen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="C2T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  I'm very pleased to second the motion for the second reading of the member for Mayo's bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Ban on Gambling Advertisements) Bill 2023, because, quite frankly, Australians are sick to death of gambling advertising. It's no wonder, when the study commissioned by the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation found that more than 70 per cent of Australians want gambling advertising banned, and there's no wonder why, almost every day, members of the community tell me they're well and truly over watching gambling being promoted and normalised, often diminishing their enjoyment of sport and impacting dangerously on their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That last point matters so very much, because way too often Australian children are bombarded with targeted advertising campaigns on billboards, on sports uniforms, on the TV and on their phones and other devices. Good grief, the adverts are everywhere. Nor, of course, is this just a matter of spoiling the game. No. Ultimately, the more the predatory gambling companies advertise, the more they prey on the vulnerable and the more they stoke addiction, just like the tobacco companies once did. Frankly, we mustn't forget the enormous human cost of problem gambling. Indeed, as the member for Goldstein noted when introducing a similar bill last month, the estimated social cost of gambling in 2017 was $7 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, such figures are well known—we've heard them time and time again—but it seems the government needs a reminder of the real impact that gambling has. For instance, take Gavin Fineff, the former financial adviser who gambled and lost $8 million of his clients' money, with the willing assistance of three of Australia's biggest online betting agencies. Yes, Gavin understands he did the wrong thing and is now in jail, but he is not the only one to blame, because the predatory practices of Tabcorp, Ladbrokes and BetEasy facilitated and encouraged Gavin's gambling addiction. They offered him VIP status, bonus bets and tickets to sporting events. But, unconscionably, none of these companies once asked where the money was coming from. Indeed, they even facilitated accounts under a false name to allow him to continue gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That this madness continues and that almost all the political parties remain beholden to gambling companies really does beggar belief, but I suppose it's not difficult to understand why when you consider the report by the Centre for Public Integrity, which shows $24 million in donations from the gambling industry to the major parties over the past two decades. It's no wonder the current Minister for Communications' receiving of big gifts from Sportsbet before the last election hardly caused a ripple.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Mayo for this bill, as well as the member for Goldstein, who introduced a similar bill last month, and I'm delighted to second it. At the same time, I ask the government: what further information do you need? We know what the problem is. We know the harm it causes. We know Australians are sick to death of gambling advertising and want it banned, so, for God's sake, let's just do it. Let's get behind this bill, which would do just this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They see ads for unhealthy food when they watch the footy on telly with their family, they hear them on the radio in the car on the way to school and they are saturated with unhealthy food ads whenever they go on social media or online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With Australians being bombarded with unhealthy food ads all day, every day, is it any wonder we are facing an epidemic of obesity in this country?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are the facts?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two-thirds of adult Australians and one-quarter of our children are above the healthy weight range.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With such high proportions of our population affected, we know without doubt that obesity is a societal problem that needs a societal response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know obesity is one of the leading causes of chronic disease in this country—including diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. It also an important causal factor in several cancers, depression and dementia—and according to the National Obesity Strategy costs Australia nearly $12 billion a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With a national debt crisis and a hospital system stretched to its limits, it is an absolute no-brainer that we act to prevent this major cause of chronic disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On average, almost 40 per cent of an Australian child's daily energy intake is from so-called 'discretionary foods'—that is, unhealthy, highly processed foods with little or no nutritional value that are high in salt, sugar or trans fats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These unhealthy foods and drinks are being pushed onto our children every day as they live, play and learn—and online it is being done via highly sophisticated and targeted marketing campaigns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of creating an environment that allows our children to flourish, we have allowed an environment that potentially harms our kids to flourish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, Australia has given the very industries that profit from the sale of these unhealthy foods the ability to set their own rules and to influence government policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear industry self-regulation, as usual, has failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research shows there are direct links between unhealthy food ads, the dietary decisions of children and families and childhood obesity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet in Australia the average child aged five to eight years old is exposed to more than 820 unhealthy food advertisements on TV each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children are also seeing at least 100 promotions for unhealthy food online every week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Powerful algorithms are used to individually target our children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their online activity is mined—thousands of 'interest labels' attached to them, and this information is on-sold to thousands of companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, our children are being saturated with unhealthy food marketing whenever they are online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the influencer influence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Junk food companies are paying influencers to post videos of themselves eating and gorging on their unhealthy products and challenging people to copy them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Simply put, our children are being preyed upon every time they turn on the TV, listen to the radio or go online—by companies that seek to profit at the expense of their health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what can be done?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the bill I am introducing today is not exactly groundbreaking, because already approximately 40 countries around the world—including the UK, Ireland, Chile and Norway—have regulated or are planning to regulate junk food marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Chile, where junk food advertising is banned on TV from 6 am to 10 pm, there has been a 73 per cent drop in children's exposure to junk food ads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And a study of grocery habits during the first year of the ban there found there was a 24 per cent decrease in calories purchased.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quebec's restrictions on unhealthy food advertising have reduced fast food consumption there by 13 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the UK, Boris Johnson's conservative government also recognised the problem and acted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They passed legislation—to commence next year—which will prohibit all unhealthy food marketing on TV, radio and in cinemas between 6 am and 10 pm, and will ban all paid marketing for unhealthy food in online environments, including social media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Obesity Strategy, the National Preventive Health Strategy, and the National Diabetes Strategy all recommend that the Australian government step in to protect our children from unhealthy food marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a parent, a GP and now as an MP, I am urging our government to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our children are our greatest asset, and this parliament needs to step up to support parents to help their children live healthy, productive lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time Australia joined the 40 other countries that have already introduced regulations to protect their children from harmful food marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so to my bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I am proposing parliament amends the Broadcasting Services Act<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>with the adoption of my Healthy Kids Advertising Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of the bill is to protect our greatest resource—our children—from the harmful impacts of junk food advertising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not about telling people what they can and cannot buy or eat; it's about creating environments that support our kids' health as they live, play and learn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If implemented, my bill would:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Restrict junk food advertising from appearing on TV, radio, and streaming services between the family viewing hours of 6 am to 9:30 pm and also ban paid junk food marketing on social media and on all online environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the terms of my bill, unhealthy food is defined as food and drink not recommended for promotion to children in the 2018 guide published by the Health Council of COAG.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to remember this bill is just one part of a suite of measures that need to be implemented to tackle the obesity and chronic disease epidemics impacting our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But with millions of Australian children on already on track for a lifetime of chronic disease, it is time for this parliament to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so I urge all members of this House to support Australian parents and children by backing in this Healthy Kids Advertising Bill</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I second the motion. I rise to support the member for Mackellar's Broadcasting Services Amendment (Healthy Kids Advertising) Bill 2023 to prohibit the advertising of junk food to Australian children. As a paediatrician and parent, I am acutely aware of the fact that one in four of our children is obese or overweight. Obesity is one of the leading causes of chronic health disease in adulthood. It costs us $6 billion a year in healthcare costs, quite apart from the sad fact of the lives lost. Research has found strong associations between advertising of non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity. Today's children consume multiple forms of media, often simultaneously. Some spend more time in front of computer, television and games screens than any other activity other than sleeping. Most children aged less than six can't distinguish between programming and advertising. Children aged less than eight do not understand the persuasive agenda of marketing. Advertising directed at children this young is, by its very nature, exploitative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Marketing of food to children on the internet is even more complex, since the boundaries between content and advertising are often even less clear than on television. Children have a remarkable ability to recall the content of ads. They develop product preferences after as little as a single exposure. Those ads affect what they ask their parents to buy and they affect what we buy our kids. Our kids see as many as 170 junk food ads every week and pay attention to them. In January 2022, two youtubers with a massive online following released a drinks brand, Prime Hydration. In its first year, Prime Hydration generated US$250 million of sales worldwide. Most of those sales were to young men. The secret to that success was the savvy use of online algorithmic networks and scarcity marketing. This is not a product for hydration and is not a product which is a sports drink. It contains high levels of sugar and caffeine, and they have potentially significant cardiac and cognitive side effects. You might not know about Prime, but your children do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't allow tobacco advertising and we won't allow vaping to be advertised on our TVs, on our radios or online, but we are letting junk food harm our kids just as much as nicotine does. As a doctor, I've promised to first do no harm. As a politician, I have to act on behalf of my constituents. So I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I rise to present a motion in support of the Albanese Labor government's visionary decision to introduce fee-free TAFE. This transformative policy demonstrates this government's unwavering commitment to accessible education and its dedication to empowering Australians with the skills and opportunities they need to succeed. Upon taking office, the Albanese Labor government inherited not only $1 trillion of coalition debt but also a massive skills deficit. This situation is so dire that according to the OECD Australia is experiencing the second-most severe labour shortage in the developed world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is a bedrock upon which we build a prosperous and equitable society. I mentioned in my first speech the difficulties my family and I had with accessing education. During my years at the William Angliss Institute, I struggled with the steep cost of my course and other study related materials. Education should be accessible to all, regardless of background or socioeconomic status. The introduction of fee-free TAFE by the Albanese Labor government is a significant step towards realising this vision. This landmark policy eliminates the financial barriers that have hindered many individuals from being able to skill themselves to meet this nation's needs. Fee-free TAFE opens doors, expands horizons and empowers individuals to unlock their potential and contribute to our nation's growth and prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of vocational education and training cannot be overstated. As our society continues to evolve, we must equip our workforce with the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly changing economy. Recent projections show that nine of every 10 new jobs in the next five years will require a post-school qualification. Fee-free TAFE addresses this imperative by bridging the skills gap and aligning vocational education with the demands of the modern workforce. Training through fee-free TAFE is helping drive enrolments in sectors with recognised skill shortages, whether it's the care sector, agriculture, hospitality, tourism, construction, technology or the need to ensure our sovereign capability in defence and manufacturing. Fee-free TAFE delivers these skills during acute skills shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first quarter of 2023 alone, the Albanese Labor government has supported almost 150,000 Australians to enrol in fee-free TAFE, including over 26,000 in my state of Victoria alone. Almost 35,000 of the 150,000 enrolments have been jobseekers. More than 12,000 of them are people with disability, 60 per cent of them are women, and nearly 30 per cent of them have been in courses related to the care sector, an area of high priority. This shows that fee-free TAFE is not just a policy that that will deliver dividends in the future; it is one that has already delivered for our country and our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Besides addressing our nation's skills deficit, fee-free TAFE also provides much-needed cost-of-living relief, with students saving thousands of dollars in course fees. For example, students undertaking a Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care in Victoria are up to $8,700 better off. This is almost $8,700 they can save or spend on their families, homes and futures. The upcoming five-year national skills agreement, commencing in January 2024, builds on the success of fee-free TAFE. The agreement will also provide states and territories with access to additional Commonwealth investment of $3.7 billion over five years from 2024. The government's commitment to invest an additional $400 million to deliver 300,000 more fee-free TAFE places Australia-wide from next year is another testament to this policy's success. Fee-free TAFE is an investment in Australia's greatest resource: our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by commending the tireless efforts of the Albanese Labor government, particularly the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and the Minister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, in bringing about this transformative change. I thank the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I will take this opportunity to talk about our training needs in the vocational education category. I'll start by commending some of the great registered training organisations that we have in this country. I certainly reflect on those that currently exist, and have existed in the past, in my home state of South Australia. They tend to be established by some of the industry bodies. The Motor Trade Association is a good example, as are the Civil Contractors Federation and the Australian Hotels Association. These are good examples of industry groups that have taken the initiative to form registered training organisations because they know the workforce needs for their industry sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was really disappointing eight years ago when the then Labor government in South Australia ripped funding away from those registered training organisations. That government effectively had a policy that said: 'TAFE can't compete with registered training organisations in South Australia. The RTOs are too efficient. They're too responsive to industry needs and employment needs, so we're going to shut them down. We're not going to fund them anymore, and we're going to funnel all of the funding to only one organisation.' That was a great tragedy for those great registered training organisations run by people like the AHA, the MTA and civil contractors. That was a Labor government saying, 'We don't want business and industry involved in identifying training needs in their sector and providing that training, which is obviously in their best interest to do because they're the ones with the most to gain from making sure they have an efficient supply of a trained workforce.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, ever since then in South Australia—I think this is probably a problem nationwide, but it's been acute in South Australia—we've lost that connection, where industry is in true partnership with government to ensure that the training needs for their workforce are provided. When it comes to TAFE, VET or even other forms of higher education, like tertiary education, we need to make sure that we're training people for jobs that actually exist, that we don't have major labour shortages and that young people are trained for genuine opportunities that lie ahead for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have some very significant labour workforce challenges in a variety of sectors, like the agriculture sector. In the care sector it is dramatic, particularly with the dramatic challenges happening into the future. It's really regrettable that we don't have a deeper sense of partnership between government and industry groups to provide that training, provide that trained workforce and ensure that the current and—even more importantly—future workforce shortages never eventuate. It shouldn't be that difficult for government and industry to work together and say: 'These are the forward projections of what we think we'll need in a sector, and this is the sort of training that's required. Let's work together to provide it. We in industry in particular can make sure not only that we're advising government on what the genuine opportunities in workforce are but that we're also providing pathways and connections between that training and actual jobs out there in the business communities that make up those industry sectors.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a great supporter of RTOs, and particularly industry led RTOs that are, of course, providing training for workforces that they actually know exist—they are the industry. And so, when the AHA form an RTO because they want to make sure they're training people in cooking and chef related skills, it's because they absolutely need that workforce trained for the future growth of their sector. While previous Labor governments have not been interested in working with these industry groups, and in fact have actively frustrated those efforts, which disgraceful and appalling, the reverse dividend of that is being felt in a lot of workforce shortages in my home state of South Australia right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that governments, particularly Labor governments, change their attitude about that and recognise the value of working with industry groups to identify the training that is needed for future workforce requirements, provide it together and see that outcome that's in the interests of everyone, particularly those young people who will be given a strong future workforce pathway with those partnerships.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Holt for bringing forward this motion this morning, and I'm pleased to join the list of people to debate this motion. And I'd note for the member for Sturt's interest that under the previous government the number of occupations on the skills shortage list jumped from 153 to 286. I'd also like him to note that, since taking office, this government has seen the biggest job creation ever in Australia's history with over 465,000 jobs created in our first 12 months in office. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we took government, when the Australian people gave us that responsibility and put their trust in our government, the first thing we did was check what were the challenges we were facing as a government. The poor economic management of the previous Liberal government left us not only with $1 trillion in debt but also a massive skills shortage. What did we do? We looked at those challenges and we put an action plan into place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first thing we did as a government was a Jobs and Skills Summit, where the member for Sturt might like to note industry were invited, and attended, alongside people across our civil community. They came together to talk about these challenges and how we might act on them. And what did we see there? We knew that we had a critical skills shortage in the care economy. That was raised. We had a problem in terms of women's participation. What we saw come out of that Jobs and Skills Summit is what this motion is about today—action on funding TAFE, action on fee-free TAFE for hundreds of thousands of Australians to ensure not only that they're getting the best opportunity, but also to ensure that those skills shortages are reduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, if you look at the care economy, we knew we had a skills shortage, but we also knew there was a reason for that skills shortage. We knew people weren't entering into that area of employment because, to put it bluntly, it was drastically underpaid. So, the combination of wage rises, fee-free TAFE and attacking those skills shortages has seen a dramatic increase in people in this country enrolled in TAFE. In fact, in this first term we've invested $400 million for a further 300,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places in high-need skills areas from 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To address the skills shortage we've prioritised sectors, we've prioritised things that have been outlined for us. Last year the Commonwealth, state and territory governments signed a $1 billion 12-month national skills agreement delivering 180,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places for this year, and the take-up has been extraordinary. In the first quarter of 2023, 150,000 Australians enrolled in fee-free TAFE. This is about getting on with the job, about attacking those skills shortages and about making sure we have opportunities in our suburbs, in our regions, across our country for people to either get themselves qualified or retrained into areas where we need people to work and where they might find employment—not just employment for employment's sake, but good employment. So it all works together with fee-free TAFE as well as the increases to wages that have been seen in our first 12 months of government. This is incredibly important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also part of the cost-of-living relief, because all those people enrolled in fee-free TAFE have avoided up to $10,000 in fees this year. That means they're being given the capacity to make different choices. You don't have to look far in my electorate to see how this is impacting because it's having an extraordinary impact in my electorate. The notion of going to TAFE had become something I would talk to young people about and they would say to me, 'What's the point?' When I'm engaging with young people now who are doing, in my electorate, lots of child care and lots of aged care, they've changed their minds about that. Particularly in aged care, they can see there's a career path. They can see they will get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, and, therefore, it's worth them investing their time and their commitment to plan a future in that sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Holt for bringing on this debate, and I want to pay tribute to the member for Gorton for his great work in this space.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  This morning we're discussing the motion put forward by the fabulous member for Holt about fee-free TAFE. I should go on the record and point out that I'm not a member of the Liberal Party or the National Party, or even the crossbench—I'm a member of the Labor Party—but I'm speaking on behalf of that side because they couldn't find three people to actually say something positive about a government policy that delivers cost-of-living relief, free TAFE—the clue's in the title—and training opportunities for everyday Australians, something that the member for Holt and our whip recognise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can never get my head around why the Liberals and the Nationals don't understand how good TAFE is. Are they wary because they think TAFE takes money away from private training providers, perhaps? I don't know. But at the federal level, for over a decade, I saw the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government leave the training sector in a hole, which has now delivered a massive skill shortage for our nation. In Queensland I saw the Newman government try and choke the life out of TAFE Queensland by sacking TAFE teachers and staff and by ripping funding out of TAFEs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, Labor governments believe in the vital role that TAFEs play in skilling Australians. We invest in not only the institution but the people. The Albanese Labor government is following that great Labor tradition, and we are investing in our greatest resource—our people. We believe in Australians and believe they can be more, and education is that great transformational policy. We're honouring our key election commitment to provide fee-free TAFE and vocational education places—places that will provide training opportunities to priority groups, increase workforce participation and address those skills gaps in the economy. Training through fee-free TAFE will help drive enrolments in sectors that have those recognised skills shortages, whether it's in the care sector, agriculture—something the Nationals might perhaps be interested in—hospitality, tourism, construction, technology or the need to ensure our sovereign capability when it comes to defence and manufacturing. We need to deliver these skills at a time of acute skills shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This supports our plans for making things in Australia; how good is that? I love it because my electorate has a strong manufacturing sector. My local TAFE SkillsTech at Acacia Ridge has a long history of providing highly-trained employees for the local workforce in Salisbury and Rocklea, where most of the manufacturing in Moreton is located. SkillsTech has some of the newest facilities, with the recent completion of a $200 million capital works program, including a 3D welding simulator for welding qualifications, which are in high demand in defence and manufacturing industries—not a job I would be able to do, based on my experience with 3D welding! There was also high demand when the Minister for Skills and Training came to visit recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Commonwealth, state and territory governments signed a $1 billion 12-month national skills agreement delivering those 180,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places. The agreement will increase opportunities and workforce participation in priority groups, including First Nations Australians, young people, people out of work or those receiving income support, unpaid carers, women undertaking study in non-traditional fields, people with disability, and certain categories of visa holders. The most popular courses have been in skills priority areas like early childhood education, nursing, support work, cybersecurity and construction. This just highlights the great success that fee-free TAFE is already having by encouraging Australians into sectors that are in desperate need of more skilled workers. Fee-free TAFE has also seen a strong uptake by women, who represent 60 per cent of all enrolments, while more than 25,000 students currently enrolled in fee-free TAFE are from households that speak a language other than English at home. Often it is the first door opening to a new career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't where it ends; this is simply where it begins. I know Minister O'Connor is keen to build on the success of fee-free TAFE by continuing to work with state and territory ministers to achieve better outcomes for students in the bush but also in the city. They're all committed to delivering access and equity to their vocational education and training system as part of the coming five-year National Skills Agreement, which will commence in January next year. The National Skills Agreement will provide states and territories with access to additional Commonwealth investment of $3.7 billion over five years from 2024. In addition, the Albanese Labor government will invest an additional $400 million to deliver a further 300,000 fee-free TAFE places Australia-wide from next year. This $4.1 billion investment shows the commitment of the Albanese Labor government to work in partnerships with states and territories. The Albanese Labor government will continue to help to give more Australians in the city and the country the skills and training they need to harness the jobs and opportunities of the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this morning to speak on the motion moved by the amazing member for Holt, because, when it comes to skills and training, the approach between us and those opposite could not be any more different. Our government is rebuilding and modernising our skill sector to ensure a stronger and more resilient economy and to give more Australians the opportunity to access well-paid and secure jobs now and into the future. This is a stark difference to the decade of mess and mismanagement of those opposite, who inflicted cuts on TAFE, cuts on universities and led us into the skills shortage that we see in Australia here today. According to the OECD, Australia is experiencing the second-most severe Labor shortage in the developed world. The project of repair that needs to be undertaken in the skills and training sector is extensive, but this government isn't wasting a moment in seeking to repair and rebuild our vocational education and skills training system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last months budget invested $400 million to deliver an additional 300,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places, which is building on the 180,000 places we created in 2023, including 120,000 places in New South Wales, underpinning our commitment to affordable vocational education. We increased funding by an additional $54.3 million to critical Australian Apprenticeships supports to improve completion rates, including 3,265 apprentices currently training in my electorate of Cunningham. We're investing an additional $436 million over four years to fundamentally reform the way the Commonwealth delivers foundation skills programs as well as $8.6 million to deliver the Australian Skills Guarantee and introduce national targets for apprentices, trainees and paid cadets working on Australian government funded major infrastructure and ICT projects; $3.9 million in additional funding over four years to establish a defence vocational skills task force. to develop the workforce required to shape our sovereign industrial base and support the delivery of defence programs; and $42.2 million to develop a modern fit-for-purpose IT system for the VET Student Loan program. There has been a strong response from the community following these investments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first quarter of 2023, the Albanese Labor government has supported almost 150,000 Australians to enrol in fee-free TAFE, with more than 65,000 of them from my home state of New South Wales. As of 1 June, in my electorate of Cunningham over 2,000 students were benefiting from fee-free TAFE places. More broadly, in New South Wales we have seen over 2,000 students enrolling in cert III in early childhood education and care, 1,500 enrolling in cert IV in training and assessment, close to 2,000 in cert IV in accounting and bookkeeping and cert III in individual support, and 225 enrolling in Diploma of Nursing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's agenda is not just about making education and training more accessible; it's also about making it more affordable and reducing the cost-of-living pressures that are currently facing so many Australians. Under our plan, students undertaking a Diploma of Information Technology (Cyber Security) in New South Wales are up to $4,060 better off with fee-free TAFE. Students studying a Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care are up to $4,970 better off with fee-free TAFE. Students studying a cert IV in ageing support are up to $2,320 better off with fee-free TAFE. Students studying a cert III in manufacturing technology are up to $5,750 better off with fee-free TAFE. These achievements have only been possible thanks to the tripartite and collaborative approach that the Commonwealth has taken with businesses, unions, and the states and territories, an approach which we saw at the Jobs and Skills Summit last year and a principle at the core of Jobs and Skills Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Australian Education Union, the New South Wales Teachers Federation and the TAFE Teachers Association for their support and collaboration in making this policy a reality. I have stood with my good friend Rob Long at TAFE campuses all over New South Wales. I thank them for their advocacy and for fighting to ensure that all Australians have access to an affordable, world-class vocational education and skills system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I rise in support of the motion moved by my colleague the member for Holt. I'm extremely pleased to see the member for Holt moving a motion on TAFE, especially one that highlights the Albanese Labor government's efforts to ease barriers to entry to study for many students, particularly those which will help to reduce critical labour shortages in the short, medium and long term. There is a reason for this to be a policy imperative of the Albanese Labor government. As we all know, the Morrison liberal government gave many gifts to the incoming Labor government. Instead of being bestowed with the gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, we instead got $1 trillion of liberal government debt, years of stagnating wage growth and, of course, a labour and skills shortage. Those gifts are distinguished quite dramatically from gold, frankincense and myrrh, and they weren't given to us by three wise men either. In fact, when it comes to the labour shortage, the OECD regards Australia as having the second-worst labour shortage in the developed world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can go as far back as October 2019 for the first signs of our government making steps to address this. These steps, for anyone with a calendar open, are a bit shy of being three whole years prior to taking office. The positive inroads with establishing Jobs and Skills Australia and following through on that commitment were effectively the first plank of actualising a policy like fee-free TAFE. Getting major employers in the same room with state and territory governments, the federal government and unions to assess where the short-term holes in our labour market are and, in the next breath, to look towards the future and assessing where these gaps will be in the medium- and long-term future if not adequately addressed is public policy done right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was absolutely delighted to hear in November last year that it was my state of South Australia that signed the very first skills agreement with the Commonwealth government. The enthusiasm to be the first state to take part in this may very well have something to do with a Labor government being elected in South Australia earlier that year. You have premier in Peter Malinauskas and an education minister in Blair Boyer that were all too keen to address South Australia's skills shortages and also to empower many South Australians to upskill themselves into careers that will give them a good chance of long and gainful employment through expanding their horizons with vocational educational and training. I could see that commitment when South Australia's education minister, Blair Boyer, accompanied me, along with the minister for skills and training, in visiting TAFE Elizabeth. Talking to a number of staff at TAFE who are passionate about providing vocational training to many eager students is one thing, but to hear from some students who have benefited directly from this policy is something that everyone from ministers down to local members such as me ought to do. To hear from students who have all read an article or two telling them what the jobs are of tomorrow is one thing, but to have a government policy making it easier for them to make the choice to make that sea change certainly amounts to an example of why we are here doing our day jobs as parliamentarians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fee-free TAFE is not just something that is working but something that we as a country have been long overdue for. Having a policy borne out of tripartite discussion between the education sector, unions, big business, small business and state and territory governments putting advice to the federal government about what the needs of the labour force are and what they believe them to be puts self-interest to one side and the national interest at the forefront of the discussion, as things should be. The need for this in the discussion is paramount, because in the next five years nine out of every 10 new jobs will require a post-school qualification, with four out of those being jobs requiring vocational education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, the Albanese government sees this as both a problem and an opportunity. With fee-free TAFE, the government is investing in our human capital, investing in the careers and livelihoods of many Australians that this policy will not just touch but alter the trajectory of their working lives for the better. Many students undertake vocational training for a number of reasons, whether it is to upskill the base of skills they have already acquired, whether it is to get into a field they are passionate about, or whether it is seeking out a career path that is futureproof for years to come. Those reasons, as diverse and varied as they may be, find commonality in many of those career paths now benefiting from fee-free TAFE pathways. For many, that is something that makes undertaking vocational education a possibility rather than an aspiration for when circumstances in their life better allow for it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I stand with my colleagues in support of the Albanese Labor government's policy for fee-free TAFE, and I look forward to Australia reaping its benefits for years to come by lifting people up, not pushing them down. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country, and the world, faces social, political and economic turbulence following the pandemic. The Scanlon Foundation's 2022 social cohesion study found that while social cohesion increased in Australia during this period, it is now declining as we adjust to life after this turbulent time. But the study also found that, population wide, our nation's support for multiculturalism is high and growing, with 78 per cent believing that migrants make Australia stronger, up from 63 per cent in 2018. That's why I am putting forward this important motion, as I believe this House has a critical role to play to ensure that the policies, the conversations and the decisions we make from Canberra champion our cohesive Australian multicultural community and identity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that more than half of the Australian population was born overseas or has one parent born overseas. In my electorate of Fowler, the multicultural heartland of Australia, 70 per cent of my community speak a language other than English. That brings me to the role that the Special Broadcasting Service plays in encouraging and highlighting how multicultural Australia is now a fact of life in our society. Representation is critical. My life before being elected as member for Fowler was as a journalist and reporter for, firstly, Fairfax community newspapers then later with the ABC. I was the only Asian face in the newsroom. During the nineties, while reporting on local issues, my community was demonised and ostracised across all media outlets, even by our elected politicians. Had there been representation from people with lived expense of this community, it would not have ignited the flames of division that we felt at the time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Studies by the University of Canberra and SBS have shown that how multicultural communities are represented in the media affects their sense of belonging. The Scanlon Foundation found that Australians' sense of belonging has declined from a score of 100 in 2007 to 81 in 2022. Belonging is a key element in creating a social, cohesive society. Further research from Media Diversity Australia also found that while diverse representation has improved on our screens and airwaves, there is still some way to go. The <span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ho gets to tell Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n </span><span style="font-style:italic;"> stories</span><span style="font-style:italic;">?</span> report found that while public service broadcasters have improved representation in on-screen talent or in their stories told, commercial networks still severely underrepresented CALD communities in their broadcasting. Furthermore, in the newsroom and boardrooms themselves, leadership is also lacking in cultural diversity. With this, I'm proud to launch the Parliamentary Friends of SBS alongside my colleagues the member for Monash and the member for Calwell. As a public broadcaster, SBS has serviced Australians for approximately 45 years, covering stories in multilingual and multicultural media forms. I commend SBS for its commitment to ensuring that everybody's voice is captured and included. A young constituent shared with me how she grew watching her father tuning into the Vietnamese segment of SBS to learn about what was happening around the world. This experience shows that multiculturalism in the media is a powerful tool that can travel through generations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, diversity in the arts, culture and media is important, but so is representation in what we do as policy-makers. Media and politics go hand in hand. The media will report on the government policies and, therefore, the government, at the end of the day, is ultimately responsible for formulating policies to enable a cohesive, multicultural Australia. It is very exciting to see this parliament being one of the most culturally and gender diverse, but we are yet to see how this will translate into leadership roles, decision-making and policies that will benefit communities we represent and the cultural diversity within them. Australia will continue to be more diverse as time progresses, so I ask government institutions to ensure multicultural communities are included and are on their minds when formulating policies. This will eventually be reflected in mainstream media through the stories we see and in mainstream institutions at leadership levels, where lived experiences, cultural knowledge and diverse perspectives will enable better policy outcomes and decision-making that will make Australia a stronger and more cohesive nation. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  Australia has had a long and complex past, and while we have many things to be proud of, there are moments in our history that we must reflect deeply on. One such point of reflection is our history of the White Australia Policy, which is less a single point in time than a long-running period in our history of discrimination against those of non-European ethnic origin who sought to migrate to Australia. It is not until the major steps taken by the Holt government in 1966 that the task of dismantling this policy began. After three attempts, the Whitlam government passed the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975, ushering in a legal end to the White Australia Policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These moments and periods in our history are not that long ago. Many of us in this House lived in an Australia where racial discrimination was legal. Today we stand in a very different Australia that could not be more strongly contrasted with those periods. We stand in an Australia that acknowledges our past wrongs and builds towards a better and more inclusive future, one that values and encourages migration and multiculturalism. Australia has one of the highest rates of immigration in the Western world, with immigrants accounting for up to 30 per cent of our population, and in my community that number is even higher. I am proud to represent one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse communities not just in Sydney but also in Australia—68.3 per cent of my community have both parents born overseas, with 49.4 per cent of people born overseas themselves, and 66 per cent of households use a language other than English at home. These facts are what define our identity in the south-west of Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A proud moment as a representative for my community was being part of Labor's Multicultural Engagement Taskforce throughout 2020. We set out to understand and engage with multicultural communities across Australia, welcoming submissions from individuals and groups. We heard that CALD communities were often unaware of government services, and that when they were they faced additional barriers that made access more difficult. That was across all services, from the NDIS and aged care to business support. We heard that CALD communities were feeling the effects of rising right-wing extremism and racism. Since coming to office, the Albanese government has taken a proactive role in ensuring that CALD communities do not feel left behind and do feel as if they belong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the renewed focus on repairing and strengthening our international relationships to initiatives to support CALD communities in Australia, the May budget included measures such as $2.5 million to support multicultural media literacy, more than $15 million to help multicultural communities access primary care services through the establishment of a PHN multicultural access program and also $5 million to boost COVID-19 vaccination rates in multicultural communities. These are in addition to the measures in the October budget, which included $20 million to increase the Adult Migrant English Program, which will help accessibility to English learning, almost $13 million for a two-year pilot program to assist temporary visa holders experiencing domestic violence and $7.5 million over four years for the Australian Human Rights Commission to develop a national antiracism strategy. This is just to name a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next step in ensuring a more inclusive and fairer Australia will be the Albanese government's Multicultural Framework Review. It will ensure that government policy and institutional arrangements are fit for a modern, dynamic and multicultural Australia. The review will be guided by three principles: advancing a multicultural Australia, supporting our cohesive and inclusive multicultural society, and ensuring settings that are fit for the purpose of harnessing the talents of all Australians. Listening was the foundation of Labor's Multicultural Engagement Taskforce in 2020, and it is the principle that underpins this review. There will be extensive consultation with key community groups who reflect diverse views and backgrounds; experts; Commonwealth, state and territory government agencies; as well as members of the public. That is what will ensure government services and policies are in line with the needs of my community and multicultural communities throughout Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Multiculturalism is what defines Australia, and the Albanese Labor government has demonstrated that we will continue to build and strengthen our success as a diverse community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I'm very pleased that this motion has come before the House. In 2004, when I returned to this House for the third time, after being defeated twice and being a oncer twice, I found a place that had changed. I grew up in a multicultural community. It was just natural for all of us—half of our community were migrants from Europe; farmers, great industrious people—to celebrate it. But around that time, starting with the New South Wales Labor government, the ministerial role of minister for multiculturalism was dropped. That then spread like wildfire across state governments and eventually to the federal government, where we didn't have a minister for multiculturalism. This gave me the feeling that I didn't believe that my multicultural community that I so celebrated, especially the Italian community—and all my friends and all the people that I grew up with were these people—had been recognised and celebrated in the way that they should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then we have had waves of different nationalities come through this nation, including numbers of Vietnamese who came here under the then Liberal government. Were there difficulties? Of course there were, but none were much that you would wipe the word 'multiculturalism' from your everyday language. So I needed a partner of crime, and I found Maria Vamvakinou. Maria is of Greek background. Totally opposite to me, she's in the Labor Party—I was in the Liberal Party. But what we had in common was a love for our multicultural communities and the fact that, at that time, they were diminished by governments not recognising their important contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On visiting a number of communities, we found that they felt that we as leaders had walked away from them. I think the member for Fowler, in her address, said that when she was first at work she found really strong discrimination against one particular group in the community in her area. They felt not celebrated; they felt like they didn't belong. Hope for the future, control over your life, and belonging—these things make for a very happy community because people feel like they belong. Every member of this House would have been to a citizenship ceremony where new citizens have said: 'I now belong. I can call myself an Aussie overseas. I get off a plane and I'm home. I'm home! It doesn't matter the colour of my skin or the shape of my face. I'm home in this nation, where I and my family belong.' They celebrate not only their hard work, endeavour and success but also their children being able to get a university education and go on to do great things, both here and overseas. Why am I so closely connected to this? It's because I represent the Latrobe Valley, where workers came from all over Europe to build the Snowy power system, which has given us such great benefit for all these years—until power prices went through the roof and we started to close power stations and even blew one up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Fowler for bringing this forward, but it means that, for us to succeed as leaders, we must have continual vigilance in ensuring that new Australians are included in our society. We must become inclusive parliamentarians, and inclusive in government, making sure that people know that they belong in this Great South Land, where they have built themselves an amazing, fantastic future, to the point where one now sits with us in the parliament.</span>

                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to speak to this motion by the member for Fowler. In my first speech in this place, I spoke of the need to really value and incorporate the great untapped wealth of knowledge and experience in those Australians who have migrated here. I reminded us of Gough Whitlam, who said in 1972, 'We need to liberate the talents and uplift the horizons of the Australian people.' In 1973, now 50 years ago, the Whitlam government immigration minister, Albert Grassby, published our first multiculturalism policy paper, <span style="font-style:italic;">A multi-cultural society for the future</span>. No-one understood the word 'multiculturalism' back then. It was groundbreaking. Grassby wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In a family the overall attachment to the common good need not impose a sameness on the outlook or activity of each member, nor need these members deny their individuality and distinctiveness in order to seek a superficial and unnatural conformity. The important thing is that all are committed to the good of all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grassby's pluralism was the seed for the policy changes that followed. It is safe to say that Australia's rich cultural tapestry in 2023 owes much to the far-sightedness of people like Whitlam and Grassby. Our parliaments, too, now bear evidence of change, with many more cultural backgrounds represented in them than ever before. It's an unfinished journey, but one that I'm happy to share.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fowler points out that now more than half—about 55 per cent—of our population is born, or has one parent born, overseas. This figure is accentuated in Hasluck and Western Australia, where it is actually closer to 62 per cent. Our myriad connections with the wider world are closer than ever, with people in Hasluck hailing from New Zealand, India, the Philippines, South Africa and many other lands. We have had the SBS for 50 years now, broadcasting in over 60 languages, which I'm told is a world record. Many of the one in four Australians who speak another language at home consume their daily news in that language first and in English, perhaps, second. In Hasluck, with its quickly expanding mortgage belt, Punjabi has overtaken Italian in recent years as the second most spoken language, and Gujarati is not far behind. These communities provide language lessons for their children so that they grow up knowing their mother tongue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is the only thing holding back greater appreciation for our many communities? Is it a lack of curiosity? Is it racism? Is it simply ignorance? Education has a great role to play, not merely through formal schooling but by the sharing by those communities of the cultural, lingual and religious gifts with the community at large, often supported by governments at every level. The opportunities to mix, interact and learn from each other will liberate the great untapped wealth of knowledge and experience that I spoke of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the May budget, the government made allocations for further assistance for our multicultural communities. There will be an improved delivery model for the Adult Migrant English Program from 1 January 2025 building on the allocations made in the October budget for improving that program. Supporting English language development for new arrivals is not just important from a practical viewpoint, allowing migrants to better connect with their day-to-day challenges; it is a friendly introduction to Australian culture and a welcoming gesture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also providing $9.1 million to extend the youth transition support services and further assist young migrants in their employment outcomes. These measures are on top of the investment the government has made in bringing down visa waiting times across the whole immigration system. The coalition allowed the migration system to be so banked up that it was almost unworkable. People shouldn't have to wait years for a visa or for an answer. And the bringing of greater speed and certainty to these processes is another way to support multicultural communities. The recognition of overseas qualifications is an ongoing challenge, one which it will serve us to streamline. I was glad to see this as part of the recently signed FTA with India, which is now the leading source of migrants to Australia. Annex 8(c) of the agreement directs the parties to enhance cooperation on skills development and mutual recognition of professional qualifications as well as vocational education and training qualifications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The multicultural review framework, the first such review for decades, commenced in October last year and will report by March 2024. It will be comprehensive and will draw upon the gifts, skills and talents of all of our cultural groups and of all who cherish them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the deputy chair of the parliament's defence subcommittee and previously its chair, I've been privileged to spend a great deal time with members of the ADF and veterans. Men and who serve our nation in uniform are owed a great debt for their sacrifice, their service and their love of country. That is why I have been so passionate about veterans' wellbeing since my election in 2016. I want to acknowledge the member for Herbert and all members in this House who have served this country in uniform. Unlike Labor, we elevated the veterans portfolio to cabinet. Unlike Labor, we delivered the veterans covenant with support of veterans in the LNP. Unlike Labor, we invested $11.5 billion in a plan to back our nation's 340,000 veterans and their family members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, the former coalition government introduced a program to maintain incapacity payments for veterans who were undertaking approved study. The same coalition government then further provided a 100 per cent subsidy complementing existing incapacity payments. Last year, we passed a further bill on incapacity payments for veterans' rehabilitation and compensation. This bipartisan support was a sign that the government would carry on the successful programs of the coalition government. It turns out that that was just wishful thinking. Now eight months later, not only is 100 per cent subsidy gone, but the entire program comes to an end. It is over from 1 July this year. We had no consultation, no rationale and no warning. Veterans partway through their approved courses will now be out of pocket. It's very appropriate that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is in the chamber here listening. I hope he's listening. I call on the government and I call on the minister to restore those payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think that there is an enormous opportunity that we are missing in this country in relation to fostering veterans' wellbeing and long-term success. I want to acknowledge the member for Braddon, who has walked into the chamber as well, and his service in this country. If there are any other veterans on either side of the House that are anywhere near the chamber, come on in; you're more than welcome! Approximately one in 10 Australians will experience PTSD in their lifetime. Veterans are among those most significantly at risk, particularly in the transition to civilian life. In transition, there is often a sense of purposelessness, a loss of community and a change in the structure, expectations and routine which scaffold a life in the military. We know that education can play a transformative role in a person's life, contributing to their personal and financial recovery and growth. We know that this is what many ADF members and veterans want. In the interim report of the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide, one serving member stated that there needs to be a 'tertiary education or proper employment program' and said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Meaningful employment and genuine gratitude for veterans is i believe the key to solving the veteran suicide issue in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've repeated time and again in this place and outside it, it is high time for Australia to introduce a scheme like the United States GI Bill to back veterans in their transition into civilian life. A Commonwealth assisted tertiary education for veterans scheme, what I would call the 'digger bill', would provide free tuition to eligible participants, recognising their unique training and practical experience and honouring their service. If we do this properly by engaging industry, academia, defence and the community sector, this reform stands to revolutionise the way we support, equip and honour our veterans and their families. I want to send a big shout out to Harry Moffitt, whom I've been working with on this digger bill for over 18 months. He's a great fella doing terrific work for veterans in this space. Well done, Harry.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  The motion by the member for Fisher pretends the government is scrapping a program that his government had intended to continue. It was a pilot program. It has been assessed, the evidence is in and the government has decided to progress more productive ways to assist veterans. In any event, the coalition did not provide for the pilot program to continue into 2022-23, and it is the Albanese government that has provided for it to continue until now. On what basis does the coalition now say they intended this or other programs across various departments to continue if they didn't provide for them in the forward estimates and they didn't bother legislating them? The motion is therefore poorly grounded and is misleading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion does, however, allow me to remind the House and the veterans of Australia of the ways in which this government, since coming to office just 12 months ago, has continued to honour those who have given so much to protect Australia's interests at home and abroad. In truth, I have never seen a more active Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I take any opportunity to relay to the RSLs in my electorate of Hasluck, being the sub-branches at Bassendean, Bellevue, Chidlow, Ellenbrook, Kalamunda and Mundaring, just how much the government has been doing for our veterans. There's already a great deal for veterans and their families to like and a great deal left to the coalition to explain as to why the veterans claims system was allowed to be run down and cause delay, heartache and ongoing frustration to the thousands of our men and women who have done their service and who reasonably expect to be served well by the government and not poorly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, this minister, has hit the ground running in this portfolio. On 24 June last year, hardly a month into the job, the minister quite rightly made public the report into the Department of Veterans' Affairs claims processing system and pledged to take action to fix the backlog. He said at the time, and I agree, that it simply is not good enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July, the government committed an additional $70.6 million in funding over four years to increase Veterans Home Care fees for domestic assistance and personal care services and also took legislative action to ensure that no veteran would pay higher income tax due to the Douglas decision in the Federal Court. In August, the government committed $22 million in funding to provide psychiatric assistance dogs to veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder and $33 million to extend access for free medical treatment for veterans. Back in October last year, the government invested $537.5 million in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, including 500 new frontline staff to address the compensation claims backlog and deliver faster decisions for veterans and families; the modernisation of the IT system of the department to improve the claims-processing services; addressing longstanding complexity in the legislative claims regime; providing for better modelling for better future services; 10 more veterans and families hubs; a new Veterans Employment Program; and an increase in the total and permanent incapacitated payments, supporting 27,000 of our most vulnerable. Additionally, in the May budget, the government invested $64.1 million to further eliminate the claims backlog left to this Labor government by the coalition; a further $254.1 million over four years, building on the October budget, to modernise and secure the department's IT systems; half a million dollars, with ongoing funding, to extend the Defence, Veterans and Families Acute Support Package to grandparents who are full-time carers for grandchildren who are children of veterans; and $2 million to continue the mental health literacy and suicide intervention training program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures are, in different ways, part of the government's response to the interim report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, and that work continues. In the last parliament, the member for Burt, as spokesperson, stated plainly:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have a duty of care for those who have served. This is especially so where that service has had a greater impact on them and their families now and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the minister and the government are walking the walk. I thank the member for Fisher for the chance to outline the significant contrast between the Albanese government's keen interest in and tangible support for our veteran community and the lazy and insufficient care taken by the previous government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  We must do everything we can to support our veterans, which is why I second this motion this morning. This motion calls on the government to undo its reckless decision to cut incap payments for veterans who are studying. When the original bill to extend the scheme came before the House last year, we gave Labor our support. This scheme should be bipartisan. But now the Albanese Labor government has quietly axed it. This was a program that provided 100 per cent of a veteran's pre-injury earnings for them to undertake full-time study as a part of their DVA approved rehabilitation plan. Without the bipartisan extension of the 100 per cent incap payments, they would be phased out. Providing a financial support during study takes away a significant barrier which might otherwise discourage a veteran from study and building a life after service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing more important when transitioning out of the military than meaningful engagement and/or meaningful employment, and I'm living proof of this. After my deployment in Afghanistan, I was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, with being deaf in one ear from an IUD blast and with post-traumatic stress disorder. With many months off work, being disengaged from both Army and civilian life, things got pretty tough. Eventually, with significant support from my family and friends, I picked myself up and signed up to a number of educational programs. Over time, the meaning of life returned. I had purpose, responsibility and accountability. Being meaningfully engaged led to employment and the path to my new normal. If I hadn't begun my education, I could have been in a very different place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't need to look too far into many studies that show defence and veteran suicide rates to realise that one of the root causes is a lack of meaning and purpose. Gaining meaning and purpose doesn't always take the form of study, and that's fine—we're all very different—but it is definitely one way we can try and make a difference in the lives of those veterans who feel called to further education and a new chapter in their life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville is the largest garrison city in the nation, so you can imagine how many of my constituents will be significantly impacted by this cut. A number of veterans have contacted me specifically about this issue, mentioning their incredible sense of pride, achievement and self-betterment through study. One of them is John Lay. He wrote to me explaining that without the incap payment he will not be able to complete the final year of his four-year degree, missing out on the potential job opportunities it would have created for him. In an open letter regarding the end of the program, Veteran Advocacy Australia said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Veterans have made life changing and financial decisions based on their enrolment in this program. And it would be terrible to see Veterans now withdraw from study, some close to completion, as they can no longer afford to participate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has not released any data to justify this decision, but these testimonies are evidence of the program's success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to point out that I have written to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on this very matter, on behalf of my constituents and veterans nationally. That was at the start of the year, and I still haven't received a response. What's changed? Our veteran community's need for this scheme certainly hasn't, which means we can only assume that this is a cost-cutting decision that is going to impact our veteran community—those who put their lives on the line for the safety of our country. I'd like to remind the Labor government that the bill to extend the scheme was passed with bipartisan support. Our veteran community is already in a state of crisis, and, by axing this program that alleviated financial stress, fuel is only being added to the fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The extension of the 100 per cent in-cap payment would provide our veterans with short-term financial aid for long-term and potentially life-saving gain. I implore the government to reconsider the axing of this program, and I commend this motion to the House. In doing so I'd like to acknowledge the member for Braddon, a veteran, who is here today; the member for Fisher, for bringing on this motion; and, of course, the previous minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Gippsland. In this place, on both sides, veterans affairs should be bipartisan. We haven't seen that of late, and I call on the government to return to that position.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I don't doubt for a moment the member for Fisher's sincere interest in veterans in moving this motion, but the motion is disingenuous. As the member for Hasluck has, quite rightly, pointed out, we are dealing with and talking about a pilot program which would have ended on 30 June 2022 under the previous coalition government and was extended for a further 12 months until the end of June 2023. With all pilot programs it's very likely that they will come to an end, and the minister, quite rightly, has committed a whole range of resources to continue support for veterans across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have about half a million veterans throughout Australia. When you add their spouses, partners, siblings and other close family members, there are literally millions of people that may be impacted by the lives of those veterans. The reality is that too many veterans struggle through life. They struggle to adjust to civilian life once their service ends. We know that throughout the veteran community there are high rates of family breakdown, high rates of suicide, high rates of divorce, high rates of PTSD, high rates of homelessness and perhaps high rates of alcohol and other drug use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is considerable evidence that military service does change people's lives. It's a unique type of service and, quite often, those who engage in wartime activities experience horrific scenes. For many veterans, it's only their mates who served along with them who truly understand their struggles. When enlistment ends, many of them then have to deal with the bureaucracy of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which more often than not simply adds to their frustration, leaving them disillusioned and feeling abandoned. They expect more from their governments than civic leaders turning up at commemorative events and military services, and there applauding their bravery and patriotism. All too often they are left to turn to local veterans support groups for the support they need. In my own region, it is volunteer groups like the Vietnam Veterans Association Northern Suburbs Sub-branch, the Para District Branch of the National Servicemen's Association, the RSL clubs, the Peter Badcoe Ex-Military Rehabilitation Centre and Operation Unity, and individuals like Dr Glen Edwards who, quite often, are there to pick up the pieces and lend their support and assistance to veterans when they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government, however, is indeed committed to supporting our veterans and their families. I commend the minister, who is in the chamber right now, for the work he has done thus far and for the statement that he made in response to the interim report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, where he outlined a whole series of strategies and support measures that arise from those recommendations that this government is committed to. More importantly, he has committed $234 million for 500 frontline DVA staff to deal with the backlog of claims. I note those claims have been reduced by 23 per cent in the last six months alone. He has also committed $46.7 million for 10 new veteran hubs across Australia—they will respond to the varied needs I referred to earlier on—and $24 million for the Veterans Employment Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite had been in government for 20 of the last 26 years. They've had considerable opportunities to address all the matters they now come into the chamber and raise. Indeed, looking at their track record, whether it was to do with the royal commission into veteran suicide, the awarding of the VC to Teddy Sheean—indeed, even in the last government we know there were reports their own minister was at odds with his own cabinet over support for our veterans. The government is getting on with the job, as it quite rightly should, to support our veterans. Yes, there'll be a further report when the final report of the royal commission is handed down, and I know the minister will do what he can to respond to the recommendations in that report.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I take great pleasure in joining the debate on the motion moved by the member for Fisher. I take this opportunity to acknowledge all current serving members in Australia, and veterans as well, and people in this place who have served our nation in uniform. I thank you for that service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There would be very few members in this place today, other than those who actually served in uniform, who would have spent as much time with our veterans communities as I have over the past five years. I'd say one thing to those opposite as they quote their Labor talking points: the one thing about our veterans is that they can smell bulldust when they see it and hear it, and what they've heard this morning is complete and utter bulldust. They understand this program has been cut. You can dress it up however you like—you can call it a pilot program or whatever you want to call it—but it is a cut. The minister himself is at the table, and he knows that he's had to cut the program, that he's decided to cut the program. Go out and defend it and say why you've cut the program. We haven't seen any information before us as to why those opposite think a program designed to help members transition to civilian life should be cut in this manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely want to pass this on to the member for Hasluck: if there's one portfolio in this place that has always enjoyed bipartisanship and a level of dignity above all others, it is the portfolio of Veterans' Affairs. What she had to say here this morning was appalling and not worthy of the bipartisanship this portfolio has always enjoyed. I pass that on to the member for Hasluck and encourage her to have a better look at the record of the coalition when we were in government and the various portfolio programs we initiated almost always with bipartisan support—initiated by members on this side with lived experience in our defence forces to make a difference in the lives of the men and women who serve in uniform and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Fisher for bringing this motion to the House because it is entirely consistent with his approach in this place and his dedication to ensuring that our men and women who serve are given every opportunity to succeed when they transition to civilian life. The member for Fisher knows as well as I do the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of men and women who serve in uniform in this place train well, serve well, transition well and go on to become highly valued citizens in public life. I don't have to look very far around our community to see examples of men and women who've had military service delivering extraordinary programs through their public life or their private life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was the veterans' affairs minister I was always keen to champion the opportunity for our private sector to hire veterans because, despite the diet of hopelessness and helplessness spread through the media, the vast majority of those who transitioned out of military went on to have successful civilian lives. And hiring a veteran was good for business. Hiring a veteran was something that the business community began to understand was a good tactical move on their behalf because these men and women had been trained, had loyalty, had leadership skills, had management skills and were highly capable at transitioning into civilian life and making a real difference in the broader community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just need to dispel some of the myths being perpetuated by those opposite here this morning, that somehow members on this side of the House didn't care about our veteran community during our time in office. It is an outrageous slur to suggest that there are members of this place who do not care about our veteran community, who do not want to make every effort to ensure they are well supported as they move into their civilian life. In our time in government, we introduced things like the veterans' payment for the time. The veterans payment was introduced whereby a veteran who was coming forward with mental health claims would receive a payment before that claim was even assessed. And we introduced free mental health care for all veterans and their families regardless of the conditions in which they sustained their injury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We introduced the veterans' recognition bill, which was a deliberate strategy to encourage more veterans to come forward so that the Department of Veterans' Affairs would actually know who the veterans were. Until we were in government, the Department of Veterans' Affairs had no way of tracking whether a person was actually a veteran in the first place. So, for the very first time, the previous government introduced a question in the census asking people had they served in the Australian Defence Force. We found out that we had more veterans than we expected because more veterans came forward and acknowledged their service in that way, and we were able to help them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We introduced, for the first time, psychiatric trained assistance dogs for veterans experiencing mental health concerns. We introduced that because we recognised it was one way we could support veterans who were suffering from PTSD. We were the first government to introduce wellbeing centres. The first six wellbeing centres were introduced by the previous coalition government, a policy the current government is continuing to develop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All I would say in relation to this motion is those opposite need to be honest with the Australian veteran community. They need to acknowledge that all members in this place work tirelessly to make sure our veterans and their families are well supported in their civilian life.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  Our veterans have given so much for our country, and in return they deserve to be looked after. As a government it is our responsibility to make sure that when our servicemen and women return home they are supported to help them live the best life they can. One of the ways veterans can be supported to live their best lives is through access to education and employment. Study is one of the best ways to make sure veterans are equipped for a civilian workforce, which is no doubt in many ways an entirely different world to the one which they have become so used to during their service to our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have stood in this place and made a lot of claims but make no mistake, this government supports veterans and their families, completely and unconditionally. The Incapacity Payments for Veterans Studying Pilot program was established with the aim of encouraging veterans to undertake full-time education as part of their rehabilitation program by maintaining their incapacity payments at the level of their prior salary at 100 per cent while participating in such full-time education to enhance their employment prospects. We did what the previous government did not do, despite saying they would, and extended this program to 30 June 2023. In making this extension, it was made clear this was only until 30 June, and in February 2023 all pilot program participants were again advised that it would end on 30 June 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important to note that the end of this pilot program will not affect other forms of education assistance from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and it will not prevent veterans from continuing their studies. What it will mean is, after 45 weeks on the incapacity payment at 100 per cent of their previous earnings, veterans will have their incapacity payments decreased to 75 per cent of their previous earnings, just as is the case for veterans not in the pilot program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to help veterans and their families, but it is vital to make sure that we are providing the help that is needed and that the help that we are providing is effective and having a real impact in assisting veterans. In extending the pilot program, we were able to look at how effective it is. Approximately 600 veterans, of approximately 6,000 eligible veterans, have taken up the opportunity through this pilot program since 2018. This means that the take-up rate has been about 10 per cent, which is similar to the proportion of veterans that were undertaking full-time study as part of a rehabilitation program before this pilot program. We know that this pilot program has been of benefit for recipients, but the reality is that it has not achieved significant improvements to veterans' employment prospects when compared to those of eligible veterans who did not take part in the pilot program. It would be irresponsible for any government, and it would not be fair on veterans, to allocate money and resources to a program which does not adequately provide the assistance which is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an alternative approach for supporting veterans' employment, and this approach will have real impacts. In the October budget, this government committed to and funded a $24 million veteran employment program which seeks to build on existing initiatives to raise awareness, highlight the benefits of employing veterans and veterans' families, provide support to businesses to attract, recruit and retain veterans and provide support to transfer veterans' military skills and experience to the civilian workplace. This program will support veterans to recognise and communicate the value of their skills gained in service—skills like leadership, teamwork, agility, discipline and the ability to work under pressure, which are all critical skills in the modern economy and which all employers are demanding currently. The skills of our veterans are so valuable, and it's important that employers know this. The program will also develop pathways for vocational education and qualification providers, as well as universities, to recognise and give credit for skills learned and experience gained through defence service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In ending, I just want to say thank you to our veterans and their families for all they have sacrificed for this country. The government and our nation as a whole are in debt to you, and I assure you all this government has your back and we will always fight to make sure that you have effective assistance when you need it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I thank the member for Fisher for bringing this motion forward, and I also acknowledge all our service men and women, past and present, and thank you for your service to our country and the freedoms that we enjoy today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from a region with an extremely proud military history. In fact, the Mid North Coast has the largest cohort of veterans in the state. As the federal representative, it is untenable to hear of the stripping of funding, programs and general resources from those men and women who have served our country. From the moment this new government came into power, the active deprioritisation of veteran support began. In my electorate of Cowper, the previously secured funding of $5 million for the Veterans Wellbeing Network Mid North Coast was immediately redirected. The money had been confirmed by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in the 2022 budget, much to the relief of the dedicated volunteers supporting our 9,000-strong veteran cohort and their families. The proposed network represented better value for the taxpayer, in that it funded not one but three physical centres, located from Grafton to Taree, for the same amount of money that a single centre in other electorates had previously been provided. But, by June 2022, the news came that, rather than being used to fund such a model, the money was now being redirected to a single wellbeing centre to service smaller numbers of veterans, in a Labor seat, due to a Labor election promise. Neither the October budget nor the most recent announcements have rectified this clear misappropriation of funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last month, we saw the removal of funding from the Soldier On Australia Pathway Program. Jody Geosits, our local Soldier On programs officer, was made redundant. She let me know that she had been advised that the DVAs Enhanced Employment Support for Veterans grant program, which assisted the Pathways Program, had not been renewed. This grant program had been her primary source of funding. RSL Australia also received funding under the same DVA grant previously, and they, along with Soldier On, had been advised that there was no identified alternative government funding stream available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we hear of another bipartisan program, which was introduced by the coalition in 2018 and subsequently championed by both the new minister and the new assistant minister sitting opposite just last year, has been unceremoniously dumped without warning or explanation. It's nothing short of negligent. The program was devised to maintain incapacity payments for veterans and was further improved to provide 100 per cent of veterans' preinjury earnings for them to undertake full-time study as part of a DVA approved rehabilitation plan, a sensible planning plan, a sensible program. In May last year this House debated and passed the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022, and we were grateful, as a coalition, for the recognition of the successful program contained within the bill and to see the extension of the 100 per cent subsidy for another year. Eight months later, what do we see? The entire program is now coming to an end. There's been no formal announcement of the removal; it's just quietly being discontinued without consultation or rationale. If the program was unsuccessful in some way, where's the analysis?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm calling on the government to show our veterans and their families the respect they deserve and to provide them with the resourcing that they desperately need. I can't understand why the department would do this. If you look at the rates of suicide and the multitude of other issues that are endemic amongst our veteran community, any removal is completely inappropriate. The 600 veterans per year that will be impacted by Labor's decision to scrap the scheme deserve better. In the few seconds I have left, through the chair, I implore the minister to reinstate the funding for my veterans and allow them to have a place to go for their wellbeing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  I too rise to commend the motion to the House, and I thank the member for Fisher for bringing it to us. It is quite disappointing that we have to be having a partisan debate about anything to do with supporting our veterans, in particular this program. This is the first time I've ever spoken in a debate in this place about supporting our veterans where we haven't had that really important bipartisanship and unity amongst all members for something which I think is fundamental to the Australian character—ensuring we are doing absolutely everything and using all the resources available to us at every opportunity, as a government, to support those men and women who have served our nation in uniform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like any motion or bill in this place regarding veterans, I particularly thank all of the members of this House and the other house who have served our nation, particularly in conflict. I thank them for their service, and I recommit all of us to the important task of supporting veterans in their futures, from a health point of view, from a career point of view, from a wellbeing point of view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, I have the Jamie Larcombe Centre, which is an excellent facility providing support to my veteran community and, frankly, veterans throughout metropolitan Adelaide. I also have some unbelievable people in my RSL clubs that do excellent work and run excellent programs to support veterans from a variety of points of view in their post-service lives. That is why it is so disappointing to see we have lost the bipartisanship around this particular measure, around the proper and full support to veterans while studying as they seek to maximise their future opportunity in their careers post serving our nation. It is with great regret that we have seen a breakdown of this bipartisanship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good example of where this program may well have an excellent future, or would have if it continued on, is the exciting pathways for our veterans that will continue to be created as the defence industry in my home state of South Australia increases through programs like the submarines and the Future Frigate Program, if the Labor government isn't planning on scrapping that, as has been quietly leaked to the media, strategically, in recent days and weeks. We have an enormously enhanced skills capacity in a range of different levels of education, and this program could no doubt have provided the kind of support for veterans who see opportunities to study and to go into those exciting shipbuilding programs in both the frigate program and submarine program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But by taking this support away, I do regret that there is a good chance that there will be veterans that would have availed themselves of this opportunity, would have used this program to support their study to get qualifications that could have led them to a very significant career in naval shipbuilding in my home state of South Australia. Regrettably, that will not be the case now for many veterans because this program is being taken away, and that won't just be the case in South Australia; it will be the case across the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting veterans in every way we possibly can to achieve their full potential post service career is something that I would have hoped we would have complete unanimity around in this place. That is why I thank the member for Fisher so much for highlighting this, because it is indeed an opportunity for us to talk about how we need to have bipartisanship and unity around supporting our veterans' community towards achieving their full potential in a post-service career. By taking this program away, indeed, we are in a situation where someone if misses that opportunity, they will miss the opportunity of achieving their full potential in a future career. That is very regrettable and disappointing. I urge the government to reconsider this. I urge the government to think about the sorts of future participants in this program that could have achieved great things and will not be able to do so because they are taking it away. I hope they will reflect on this, reconsider the decision, and reinstate the program. I commend the motion to the chamber.</span>

It is important that those opposite understand the true meaning of what one-off programs are and what pilot programs are. While I am glad for the bipartisan support that comes from the opposition on many measures that support our veterans, it is important that they understand the program that they set up to increasing capacity payments for a short period while a veteran was undertaking education was just that; it was a pilot program. They committed to extending it but they didn't deliver on it. They left that to us going into government. We did that. We also said we would evaluate the program. That was critical. We undertook the evaluation of the pilot and what we found was that it was not encouraging more people to undertake the program, to undertake education or to go on to employment. So while the goals and objectives were positive and good and we supported those, what we found was the program didn't deliver on those outcomes, and that is why the pilot came to an end, as we said it would when we did a one-year extension, as we said it would when we communicated early to all those veterans that were participating in the program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, like any government, I hope, undertake pilots so we can see if things work. If they don't seem to deliver outcomes, we want to make sure we are focused on the things that do actually deliver the positive outcomes that we all want to see for our veterans by doing things like responding to the interim report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, by doing things like delivering the rollout of our veterans and family hubs across Australia and by doing things like delivering on housing for homeless veterans by supporting a Housing Australia Future Fund, something that those opposite, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Greens have continued to fail to do. When they come in here with a motion about us not supporting veterans, when we've done the right thing, they need to look at themselves and at what they are not doing in the Senate, right now, which is harming veterans. We're committed to a better future for our veterans and families, and all I ask is that those opposite in the Senate do the same.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  Until the extraordinary revelations last year, I could not have imagined that this legislation, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, would be needed. After last year, we know just how important it is. When we gathered for the censure motion against the member for Cook in November, I noted that such a motion was 'as rare as it is grave', and that the fact that it had become necessary constituted 'a profoundly sad moment in the life of our national parliament'. But, as I also said, to ignore what had happened would have added up to something far worse. It would have amounted to complicity. It would have been tantamount to us saying, 'Well, that was okay.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen no regret from the member for Cook, no sense that he has come to grips with the gravity of what he did: a secretive and calculated course of action that was nothing short of a trashing of our democracy. This is not something that can be swept under the carpet, nor can it be brushed off as partisan politics. When it came to the member for Cook's secret portfolios, the explanations that were put forward were described by Ms Bell as 'not easy to understand' and 'difficult to reconcile' with the facts. The implications were there very clearly in the Bell inquiry. There was 'a risk of conflict' if different ministers wanted to exercise the same power inconsistently. Ms Bell confirmed the Solicitor-General's view that, in her words, 'the principles of responsible government were "fundamentally undermined"' because the member for Cook, the then Prime Minister, 'was not "responsible" to the parliament, and through the parliament to the electors, for the departments he was appointed to administer'. It undermined public confidence in government. It was, according to Ms Bell, 'corrosive of trust in government'. The public didn't know, according to the Bell inquiry, something that it was entitled to know.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see the member for Cook has taken to the pages of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> recently to give us self-righteous lectures on the need to uphold and strengthen Western civilisation. How extraordinary to read such words from a man whose actions were so cavalier, so calculating and so cynical—actions that undermined our democracy, a democracy that is one of the greatest representations of that civilisation he professes to respect. It could be one of the most perfect self-awareness vacuums we've ever seen, but the evidence points to a simple truth, and that is that the member for Cook either just doesn't get it or does not care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences of his actions are a taint upon this place. His behaviour has been a disgrace to the party that shares the benches with him. To accumulate portfolios so methodically and with such compulsive secrecy is an insult to every member who put their hand up to faithfully serve their communities, everyone who has come here to better our nation, and everyone who has come here to be the best parliamentarian they can be and not a self-serving politician.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing we should never lose sight of here is this one simple fact: government belongs to all Australians. Our democracy belongs to all Australians, and it is such a precious thing. Together, we have carefully nurtured and strengthened it, standing on the shoulders of the generations that have gone before us. It is resilient, but it is not impervious and it is not invincible. If we ever want to be reminded how vulnerable even the most venerable old democracies are, all we need to do is to look around the world. We have seen it overseas, not the least of which was the assault on the Capitol Building in the United States. We cannot take our democracy for granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We owe Australian a parliament that is the very best it can be—a parliament where we know who ministers are and who are accountable, a parliament where the identity of each portfolio holder is not a matter of mystery or a secret that can be revealed only by the lottery of guesswork. This should be a place of open and respectful debate, a strong and central institution that is defined by accountability and integrity, by achievement, by outcomes, by a powerful sense that all of us who enter this place do so proudly and firmly in the service of the Australian people. People who are elected to this place have different political outlooks and ideologies, but I believe that, overwhelmingly, people come for the right reasons. They come because we are all united by a love for our country and because to be a parliamentarian is to be part of one of the great institutions that, at its best, is one of the pillars on which Australia stands. I look around the chamber and I know that, although we have differences, we share so much common ground—a belief that this place represents the interests of the Australian people, a belief that in this place we are able to do what matters and what is right, a belief that this place transcends its imperfections to be the most powerful and effective embodiment of our democracy. In doing so, let us show Australia that we and all that this parliament represents are worthy of their trust and faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this legislation we work to be worthy of all that by ensuring there will never, ever be a repeat or a sequel of this corrosive, undemocratic action. We have, in this government, a system of Westminster that it is derived from. We also have a cabinet system of government where the prime minister has often been described as the first among equals. But the prime minister of the day is not above the cabinet process and is not above the parliament or accountability. That is why this legislation is important—not because I think there will be someone who will come along and think that it's a good idea to appoint themselves to multiple ministries without telling anyone but because we thought that would never happen in the first place. That is why we need this legislation—to provide that assurance to the Australian people that it will indeed never happen again. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  I thank members for their contribution to this debate on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022. The inquiry into the appointment of the former prime minister to administer multiple departments, led by former High Court Justice the Hon. Virginia Bell AC, has made an important contribution to enhancing transparency and accountability in our democracy. The primary purpose of this bill is to implement the first six recommendations of that inquiry. The implementation of these recommendations ensures that the Australian public can have full confidence that this breach of trust can never happen again. As mentioned in the second reading speech, the bill will implement reforms to ensure the Australian people are able to access information relating to the composition of the federal executive council, those appointed to administer certain departments of state, and the high offices that ministers of state hold. This bill demonstrates the government's readiness to act promptly to restore the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government and to rebuild integrity in public sector institutions, processes and officials. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry sought to find out how the situation happened, why it happened and who knew about it, and it reflected on the culture that enabled it to happen. It is essential that we have transparency in our government processes, because our system of parliamentary democracy relies upon conventions and the Westminster traditions of checks and balances. As was made very clear by the Solicitor-General:  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is impossible for the Parliament to hold Ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which Ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, Ms Bell and her team are commended for their service in leading this inquiry. The government has accepted and implemented all of Ms Bell's other recommendations. In addition, members may be aware that the Ministers of State Act 1952 has been listed under the finance portfolio in the administrative arrangements order. On 8 June 2023 the Governor-General agreed to the Prime Minister's recommendations that the act transferred to the Prime Minister's portfolio. This reflects the provisions currently in the act and the measures that will be implemented by this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The passage of this bill also demonstrates that the government is delivering on its promise to restore trust and integrity to federal politics. The centrepiece of this is a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission. The measures in the bill will provide greater integrity and transparency around the process of appointing elected officials to high office, especially to ensure that we have a system of government where there are checks and balances and where one person cannot again garner powers without adequate and warranted accountability to the Australian people and the Australian parliament. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  When I was interrupted in the course of having started my contribution to this debate, I was just making the point that the world-wide Rotary organisation has added the environment as the seventh pillar of Rotary service, in recognition of the importance of environmental sustainability to human wellbeing. In my local area, only last month, I attended the official opening of an environmental restoration project in the Cobbler Creek Recreation Park. The project was a joint effort of the Salisbury Rotary Club, Friends of Cobbler Creek Recreation Park, Trees for Life and the South Australian government Department of Environment and Water. Throughout the Makin electorate, the Friends of Cobbler Creek Recreation Park, Friends of Dry Creek Trail and Friends of Anstey Hill Recreation Park, working together with local councils, local schools, Trees for Life, Rotary and Lions Clubs, and the Department of Environment and Water, have for years taken a lead in environmental restoration and preservation projects. I commend all of them for their efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no single solution or response to the scale of environmental degradation. It will take a collective of different actions. Even in Australia, where I believe there is much goodwill and understanding across all sectors of society about the importance of environmental sustainability, the biodiversity losses are very concerning, as the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> of the environment</span> report makes absolutely clear. This legislation provides for biodiversity protection and restoration by rewarding environmental preservation projects. In summary, the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 establishes a framework for a voluntary national biodiversity market, where landholders who participate in projects that enhance or protect biodiversity may be eligible to receive a tradeable certificate that will be tracked through a national register. The proposal provides an incentive for investments in nature. It is the first of its kind here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation includes several provisions, including the establishment of an independent expert Nature Repair Market Committee to ensure both integrity and public confidence in the process. That is absolutely vital, because if there is no integrity and there is no public confidence in the process then people will not participate. Importantly, the same integrity measures will contribute to a better understanding and more accurate data on biodiversity. That is one of the areas that I have a personal concern with—that sometimes the data we rely on is itself inaccurate. Having this process in place means that you have to have accurate monitoring in order to assess the viability and the outcomes of the different programs. That in itself is a good thing because it will enable all of us to better understand the biodiversity losses and the gains, or the regains, once a project has been in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, biodiversity restoration is also expected to create economic and employment opportunities for participants. That too is a good thing, because having more people embark on economic activities that in turn sustain our environment will start to also build up a level of expertise and understanding that will also be beneficial well into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity goals, Australia has committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030. Obviously, to do that will require a range of measures, but the very fact that we have committed to those goals means that we have now made a decision that programs and projects will be looked at in order to get there. That commitment alone, I believe, is going to begin the path and the roadway back to rebuilding our biodiversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Caring for country requires the collective efforts of every sector of society, and this legislation rewards those who do that, rather than simply relying, as we have done in the past, on punitive measures against those who engage in destructive environmental activities. The reality is, and history will show, that punitive measures alone have simply not worked. If they had, we probably wouldn't be in the situation that we are in today with the loss of biodiversity, and there probably wouldn't be the need for this kind of legislation. The reality is that we need both punitive measures and measures that reward those who do the right thing, and, again, this legislation, in my view, sets out to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have listened to much of the debate on this legislation and noted the extraordinary claims made by some members of the coalition and the Greens. To me, that suggests, as I said from the outset, that this legislation strikes the right balance. I'm not surprised to hear the coalition attack the program because of its focus on Indigenous contributions to the schemes; likewise, I'm not surprised to hear the Greens attacking the corporate interests that will probably want to participate. The reality is that everyone who can make a contribution should. With respect to the corporates, it is not just the corporates who are responsible for the environmental damage that we have seen across this country; a lot of it has come from a whole range of other sources. This legislation is consistent with proposals already in place and being trialled in other countries. Whilst it might be new to Australia, the concept is not new to the world, and I note that some countries have been participating in similar schemes for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as importantly, there are several safeguards in the bill, which I referred to earlier, particularly the establishment of the independent expert Nature Repair Market Committee. That committee will be made up of people who understand—experts—and it will ensure the transparency, accountability and integrity of the scheme. Furthermore, the scheme will result in better monitoring and understanding of biodiversity, as I emphasised in my remarks earlier on, and that can only be a good thing. I accept that quantifying biodiversity is difficult. It is something that we need to do much better. However, the fact that it is difficult should never be a barrier to a proposal which does good for our environment. In my view, the fact that it's difficult should simply be viewed as another challenge that we need to overcome. If we're committed to doing that, I believe we can overcome that challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with climate change, where crossing tipping points becomes disastrous, so too is crossing environmental tipping points disastrous—a warning well made by the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. This legislation is not the sole solution to biodiversity loss, and it may not be perfect. However, it will make a worthwhile difference. Once it is in place, any flaws that arise will be exposed and can then be rectified, but if we don't trial something, if we don't start somewhere, how will we know what impact it will have? How will we know what needs to be changed? How will we know how it can be improved?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no good reason for delaying this legislation. On the contrary, the sooner it is passed the sooner we can get on with the task of biodiversity repair. I'm pleased to see that so many other countries and so many community groups are now on board with not only this type of program but doing something about restoring our environmental losses. It is one of the areas I have pick up on when out in the community. From school children through to adults, people are concerned about the state of the world we live in and the damage that is being done to the environment. As former Bolivian President Evo Morales said—and I think this sums it up beautifully—'Humans cannot live without Mother Earth, but the planet can live without humans.' That quotation sums up the importance of protecting the world we live in. We cannot continue to expand our population and our footprint on the world without at the same time understanding the impact that has on our earth and on our marine environment. We need to start responding with more than just lip service and tokenistic schemes. We need to start responding in a way that will truly make a difference. I believe this legislation is part of the solution—not the sole solution—and we should get on with it as soon as possible.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  If you want biodiversity, if you want the trees back—and I live in the area—it's really simple: just take the stock out and leave it alone, and the trees will come back. I remember a former Prime Minister saying: 'This is marvellous. Who planted these trees?' I said, 'They just grow back.' I'll tell you what else will come if you just shut up areas. You'll not only get trees but also get blackberries, briars, pigs, goats, dears, parkinsonia, prickly acacia, parthenium weed, rubber vine, camels, donkeys, Indian minor birds—you'll get the whole gamut. Basically, the evil arc of pests and vermin also come into the land. What we've seen in so many of these areas—and I live in the area, unlike the honourable member's smiling. I bet London to a brick they don't live in a regional area. But what they never do is actually look after the area after the person's handed it over.</span>

But, you get, in an urban environment, the virtue. They get the virtue. They feel good about it: 'I've saved New South Wales!' There's a new line on a map, a new National Park. Do you go there? Rarely or probably never. Do you understand that, now you've locked this land up, apart from a line on the map, it's not really managed? Do you realise that the rating base of that town, of that shire, now has to be massively reduced? Do you realise that the people who were formerly employed on those properties as fencers, contract musterers and shearers are no longer there, therefore their kids are no longer in the school, therefore they're no longer buying at the shop, therefore there is no longer the requirement for the medical facilities in the area? Do you realise the economic changes that you foist on an area when you start this sort of virtue chasing of shutting down areas?</span>

There is an undertaking when you sign these up that there becomes an intrusion into this title. Within the intrusion into this title, you also have to comb back other things like cultural agreement, which comes into where Indigenous rights, therefore, come onto the land. And we're seeing this right now in places like Fraser Island and what people are allowed to do and not allowed to. We've seen this on beaches that have been closed off. This is not the Australia we want. In Western Australia right now, if you dig a hole more than 50 centimetres down, you have to get cultural approval.</span>

                    </a>  What we're getting now is, if you have a fence line—two foot six is how far you dig a fencepost down—you literally have to get cultural approval to put in a fence. We are seeing this now in other areas. What we have in regional areas and why we take so much of an affront to this is that we are always foisted with the requirements of the inner suburbs; these are requirements that they see as a virtue, when they're in the area which is the most environmentally changed in Australia—covered with concrete houses, tenements, high-rises and roads. Their lives don't change. Their lives stay exactly the same, but we get the wind factories. We get the solar panels. We get the cobwebs of filth going all over our land, which are the transmission lines. We have the poorer people who pay for the power prices that they cannot afford. As you bring this forward, you say to the people in our towns, in our weatherboard and iron: 'You deserve to be poor so that we can feel good. You deserve to have power prices you can't afford. The power goes onto the production of processing food, and that's all right. You can go through your shopping trolley and get rid of the meat. If you can't afford the mince, go to the pasta. We can do that to you because we're virtue signalling down here. It feels so good in here because we're on $200,000 a year plus. We can do this sort of stuff.'</span>

They're worried about the next power bill that's turning up on their table. When we see that smug look from Minister Bowen as he goes to the dispatch box and smugly turns around and gleams at the Labor Party—hasn't he done something clever? The clever cat! He's done something really clever: he's made life virtually impossible for people who cannot afford the basics of dignity in their lives.</span>

We've sort of got problems with sections of farming. We need transmission lines everywhere.' However, when they get a surplus: 'Oh, aren't we clever? Aren't we just the cleverest people on earth?' Where'd your surplus come from? There were three main things: coal, gas and low unemployment. Where did low unemployment come from? It was one of the legacies of the coalition government.</span>

You sit idly by. You don't even go up to AGL and say, 'If you don't keep that open and refurbish it, we're going to divest you of it.' No, you just sit idly by. Now you're part of this almost pathological religion. If you're not part of the 2030 82 per cent zeitgeist, you're somehow inferior. You're not wise. You're not part of the enlightened.</span>

And them too—the Greens and the Labor Party are your two groups. Go have a yarn with them about the power bill you can't pay for. If you're a farmer in New England, in my area, actually in my district, or in the Upper Hunter, or the Wimmera, or if you go up to the back of Mackay, where they're going to basically knock the top off a hill—you know, we get knocked around if there's run-off from a sugarcane field into the Great Barrier Reef. That apparently is a great evil. However, the Greens can knock the top of a hill and put in wind towers, and that's not a problem. They can put a dam in and flood a rainforest, and that's not a problem, because it's the great god Gaea clause, which means that, if it comes with a wind tower, a solar panel or transmission lines, it's virtuous and to be allowed.</span>

These people, the virtuous here, are not going to listen to you until you do one thing: you turn up out on that lawn. That makes a change. That certainly changes things. When we hear that from here and the people are upset because they can't afford their power prices, they can't afford their food prices, they can no longer afford their rent, they're getting absolutely infected with transmission lines and wind towers in the whole structure of regional areas—</span>

It's a trifecta of virtue: power prices through the roof, reliability through the floor and the overseas companies taking these silly taxpayers' money overseas.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't make these wind towers in Australia. We don't make the solar panels in Australia. The money goes overseas. You're the suckers. You, the public, are the suckers. This is why we've got to make sure that we actually have an epiphany so that people have a capacity to basically understand where the problems in their lives have emanated from and to make certain that after that epiphany that we get some logic that comes in. Moving against this is part of that statement of moving towards logic. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  We can all take a deep breath and remind ourselves we're in the House of Representatives having a debate on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023—not that you could elicit that from the previous contribution. I thank the member for New England for a minute of extraordinary sounds and squeaks and buzzing; that will be very handy for a campaign ad, maybe, later on! The member for New England came in here and demonstrated the calibre of the Dutton opposition and their attention to the complex way in which we need to manage our natural habitat and ecosystems as well as our transition towards low-emissions technology. If you ever wanted to see why the Liberal Party and the National Party are not respected and not trusted on this important task, I think anyone who watched the last 15 minutes of screaming, of ranting and of a lack of cohesion or sense would understand why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that; it's also worth mentioning the fact that, in the previous government, environmental management was not only extremely problematic and avoided but also undemocratic. In the previous term of parliament the Morrison government underwent a process through which environmental management and the protection of our environment through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was reviewed by Professor Graeme Samuel. This was a process whereby the former government, under their own appointed specialist, said, 'What do we need to do to improve the environmental standards in this country?' Professor Samuel went away and did a huge piece of work, and came back to this place and said that one of the things the federal government must have is federal environmental standards—that this place, the House of Representatives, and the federal parliament cannot absolve itself of responsibility when managing the environment. The federal government needs to lead. It also needs to work with the states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that was not the approach of the then environment minister, now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The then environment minister sought to basically take the federal government out of decision-making around environmental approvals and hand over all responsibility to the states and territories. It was a complete cave-in to the recommendations of their own review. They refused to support Professor Samuel's key recommendation that this parliament and the federal government should have standards of environmental approval and environmental management. So, instead of coming to this place and setting out those standards and improving the way in which we look after our biodiversity, our ecosystems and our precious natural environment, the federal government came into this place and said: 'We are not interested. We're not even going to listen to our own review. We're going to give it all to the states.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, to make it even worse—and all those who were members of the previous parliament will remember this well. I was sitting on the other side of the chamber. I had given a contribution, and all of a sudden the speaking list was cut and the Morrison government then used their numbers in the House of Representatives to cut off debate and ram through an environmental EPBC reform. They refused to allow the opposition to speak on the bill. They refused to allow full, proper engagement and debate on the bill. Not only were the Morrison government willing to trash their own report and the recommendations of their own engaged expert on environmental management; they were willing to come in here and trash the democratic conventions of this place in order to ram the bill through the parliament. That is the legacy of the former government when it comes to environmental management. That is the legacy of the member for New England and his friends and colleagues who came into this place and refused to lift the standard of environmental management, who refused to try and engage in a way in which this parliament can help safeguard our natural wonders, our habitats and our wildlife for future generations. So proud of their own reform were they that not one member of their team actually spoke on the bill. Not one member of their team was willing to stand up in this place and talk about the work of trashing environmental standards and then trashing the democratic conventions of this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the legacy of those opposite. We have a very different idea of what it is to be responsible environmental managers, to hand over the absolutely precious gift that we have on this vast continent of ours and to protect the wildlife, to protect the indigenous flora and fauna, that we are custodians of for this brief period of time. That's what the work we have done since coming into government, including in this important piece of legislation, is all about. It's about putting the federal government at the absolute front and centre of environmental management, ensuring that there are further environmental standards that we are all adhering to. That is going to be a key part of the EPBC Act reform that the minister for the environment will bring in at some point in coming months, complementing bills such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill is an essential part of environmental management because it is all about putting an intrinsic value on our environment and putting an intrinsic value on our biodiversity—putting a value on the precious parts of our Australian wildlife and ecosystems that is essential to protecting them and preserving them for future generations. With this bill, there are a number of components that the minister has introduced. The first thing is that it's voluntary. If a farmer or if a landowner wishes to participate in this framework, they will be able to preserve and to get credits for doing the right thing by the environment that they are custodians of. They will be able to have a certificate that then will be able to be sold on to a third party. This is a way of saying: if you are a farmer who wants another form of income, and you are passionate and you are willing and able to protect and improve and get credit for the work that you are probably in many cases already doing on your piece of land, then there will be an extra value put on that. Far from the ranting that we heard for the member for New England, this is about encouraging farmers to have an extra form of income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member for New England spoke about windfarms. I have spoken to farmers who have windfarms and wind turbines on their properties, and, depending on the size of the turbine, you can be talking about thousands and thousands of dollars of annual rental fees being paid directly into the farmer's hands for the use of their land for windfarms. It is a very, very handsome business if you are a landowner in an area where there is a good supply of wind. So this, quite frankly, pretty loose scare campaign being run by those opposite actually has no reflection on truth or reality—something that we have come to expect from the member for New England.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth mentioning that only 15 per cent of land in Australia is publicly owned. Most of that publicly owned land is owned by state and territory governments. The largest single group of landholders are the holders of pastoral leases, who control 44 per cent of the Australian land mass. It is therefore extremely important that landowners, whether they're farmers who own their land freehold, pastoralists, Indigenous communities, corporations, local governments or not-for-profit groups, they are all required to be part of the national efforts to protect and preserve our environmental heritage. That is the objective of the bill here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will quote the minister's second reading speech, because I think it sums up the bill nicely:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need to start restoring the places that we've damaged in the past. We need to start healing the land and the water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And that's what this legislation is designed to do—not to replace government effort, but to reinforce it; to add private money to the stream of investment our government is already making in nature protection and restoration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill is designed to create incentive for landholders of all kinds to undertake biodiversity on the land that they own or control. The bill provides that, when a landholder conducts an approved project to repair or protect nature, they will be issued with a certificate which will certify that the regulator has agreed to the project and that it meets the requirements laid down for biodiversity projects. Once that project is approved, the certificates can then be sold on to a third party. This will give the landholder extra income and thus a financial incentive to undertake the project and more like it in the future. It will also show the landholder's neighbours that they can make money by undertaking biodiversity projects on their land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who is going to buy the certificates? Anyone can do so—an individual, a corporation, a state, territory or local government or a non-government organisation. However, it is likely that most of the buyers will be one of two types. The first type will be individuals or NGOs who want to advance the cause of biodiversity. Let me take a moment here to give a shout-out to the incredible activists and the incredible people in the electorate that I'm proud to represent who are deeply passionate and deeply committed to protecting our environment—people who are members of groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation in Macnamara and many others. They come and meet with me on a regular basis. My door is always open to them, and I will always have time for those people in my electorate who give up their time to try and do more for our environment and for future generations. Since the certificates will contain standardised information about the project, and since their accuracy will have been certified by the regulator, people can invest in these certificates with confidence that their money will actually go towards improving environmental standards and furthering biodiversity projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second type will be corporations who want to buy certificates to offset the effects of their activities on biodiversity elsewhere. If a corporation is building a shopping centre or building a road and thereby having an unavoidable impact on the environment in that particular location, they will be able to offset that negative effect by investing in biodiversity elsewhere, through the purchase of certificates. I know that that concept does make people a little bit nervous, and there are legitimate reasons why that needs to be done in a way that is extremely regulated and controlled, but this specific arrangement is carefully constructed and it will be vigilantly policed. Governments or corporations will not be allowed to get away with causing more damage just by purchasing offsets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in saying all of that, I do think that the principle of offsets, and creating that intrinsic value, is something that we need to balance. There will be further work about how that is managed under the rewrite of the EPBC Act and the new nature bill that the environment minister is going to be bringing forward. I have already been meeting with environmental groups and environmental legal organisations, and I appreciate their advocacy on this. I think this is something that we will continue to monitor and continue to work through as we go through those environmental purposes. But underpinning that is creating an intrinsic value for creating biodiversity and protecting nature, something that fundamentally is an important reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not want greenwashing. We do not want corporations using this mechanism to damage the environment in other parts. What we want is a well-regulated system, one where nature has an important price, where nature has an important value, where we encourage and create more protection and more certainty for biodiversity, where we are able to protect more of the precious environment that we are all custodians of, but in a way where it is managed and controlled. I have full confidence in the Minister for the Environment and Water overseeing the introduction of this program. There is a 12-month lead-in time so that we can get the details right around how this is going to be regulated, how this is going to affect not only the landholders who can voluntarily participate in this program but also those who wish to purchase credits and purchase certificates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary of my contribution on the Nature Repair Market Bill, let me say this. The previous government came into this place and completely threw away any attempt at improving environmental standards and environment management. That is not our approach. We are systematically leaving a legacy of raising environmental standards, of putting a greater value on our environment and protecting it for generations to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I am proud to rise to say some words on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and how it relates to my electorate. My electorate will be one of the big winners if this bill goes through. I want to outline why. Being a regional electorate, an electorate with quite a significant history of agriculture but also of gold mining, there is a lot of repair work that needs to be done to our natural environment. If I can just take people back to the gold rush, back then they didn't know a lot about the environment, and practically every tree was felled in Greater Bendigo. You can go on bushwalks or on forest walks now where local Landcare groups will point to the one tree that survived the gold rushes, the beautiful iron barks. There are a few of them still around, but not many that survived the goldrush period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legacy of gold mining is long scars on electorates like my electorate. There was a period where they kind of locked up the areas and hoped that they would restore themselves but they didn't. We have a thing called tooth picking, where iron barks have grown back, but there are so many of them that they actually need to be thinned. It has been a bit contentious between local First Nations groups and local environmental groups about the best way to do that. I raise that because, in a lot of our regional electorates like mine, which is a very old region of Australia, there is a lot of history in what has happened to our land. In the early days of agriculture, we farmed very differently to how we farm today. New farmers are adapting, are restoring land. They get the importance of having that biodiversity on their land to improve the soil, to improve the experience of livestock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New farmers are adapting to those ways. But there is a lot of disused farmland out there that is being bought up by people who are now wanting to restore country. They are doing the lifestyle change and wanting to restore land but are trying to find out how. In parts of regional Australia, particularly regional Victoria, this bill, for the first time in a long time, puts a real opportunity on the table to reward those who do engage in that work. I am talking about our farmers and our First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make it easier for people to invest in activities that help repair our natural environment. It will help create those linkages between our national parks and state parks. There is a great organisation in my electorate called Biolinks that is working with landholders, working with business owners, working with corporations, working with First Nations people on how we can create those links between state parks and national parks to help our flora and fauna survive, basically. Because a possum or a protected species doesn't know that they're walking onto private property, and we do have linkages issues. Landowners talk me quite regularly about no lack of wanting to tap in and do work to restore country, to build those biolinks. They know it isn't their entire farm or their entire property, but they want to create those links so that we do have those nature corridors. They want to know how and they want to know the cost. We now know this bill is a way that can really incentivise getting on top of those costs and rewarding those who do step up and do something to improve our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to leave nature better for our kids and grandkids than it is today. That is why this government is supporting landholders, including farmers and First Nations communities, to do things like plant native species, repair damaged riverbeds and remove invasive species. There is an organisation in my electorate in Maldon, the Tarrangower cactus wheel club. The members literally get out once a month to help poison cacti wheel, which is a big problem in the Maldon and Tarrangower area. So committed are local people that they actually go out there each and every month to help kill this introduced species that does create such a problem for us. They're one of many groups in my electorate where people just get on with helping private landowners to stop the spread of these invasive species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we hope to see is this bill helping people to repair damaged riverbeds, which is another big problem, the legacy of goldmining and the way in which natural riverbanks dried up. Take a five-minute walk off a major road between Bendigo and Heathcote and you'll hit a gully. First Nations people will tell you that there shouldn't be a gully there. There shouldn't be a riverbank there, but because of what has happened through erosion, the legacy that landowners have inherited, we have a very unnatural way in which water runs into our major rivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help local people who are already doing good work. It will reward those who want to do more. The Labor government is delivering on its Nature Positive Plan and will establish the nature repair market in this bill. The market will make it easier for businesses, organisations and individuals to invest in projects that protect and repair nature. Our government is committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's lands and seas by 2030. It's an ambitious target, but with good partners we can do it. The same goal has been adopted globally under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. These goals reinforce the findings of the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2021</span> report and its story of environmental degradation, loss and inaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need significant investment in conservation to help restore nature for a positive, natural future. Businesses and private sector investment can contribute by reversing environmental decline. This was highlighted in the findings of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act review that was handed down. Private companies and conservation groups, farmers and other landholders are increasingly looking for ways to achieve positive outcomes for nature, and this bill helps to deliver that. The nature repair market will be based on science and will enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to promote their unique knowledge in their terms. It establishes a market in legislation which will help ensure ongoing integrity and encourage investment in nature. It will drive environmental improvements across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will enable the Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority with significant experience in regulating environmental markets, to issue Australian landholders with tradeable biodiversity certificates. These certificates can then be sold to businesses, organisations, governments and individuals, and that's the incentive that is so important. It puts on the table reward for our farmers, reward for First Nations, reward for individuals and corporations that want to do right by our environment. And we know that they will. This will encourage a new market, a positive market. It will help to give the opportunity to those who want to do the right thing to create those biolinks that I referred to in my earlier remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, the Dja Dja Wurrung, the Jaara people, have already started to do this work. I was privileged to be at their version of a sod turning on Friday for their new headquarters, which will be at the old Golden Square high school site. In our part of the world, they have had settlement with the state government for almost a decade. What that has brought in the decade that they've had is a level of experience and a level of knowledge and opportunity, and they're starting to share with the rest of us how we can restore country to what it was like for their ancestors. Their plans for the Bendigo Creek and the lands around the Bendigo Creek are absolutely phenomenal. But the Bendigo Creek doesn't run through just state forests. There's a lot of work that needs to be done with private landowners, and this bill could create an opportunity to do joint work that will see the Bendigo Creek restored, in line with the vision of our First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market will enable participation and create employment and economic opportunities for First Nations people. That's what the people in my electorate are looking forward to—the economic opportunity of earning credits by restoring country and teaching others how to do the same. It will promote and enable free and informed consent on land and water projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to say this to the opposition. In my experience, from talking to farmers in my local area, farmers really want to embrace this. The next generation of farmers coming through gets the importance of land restoration. They get the importance of having these biolinks through their properties, connecting one another. The livestock opportunity—how it keeps their farms cooler—is critical, as is having natural water resources, whether it be the Campaspe River, catchments or the Bendigo Creek. For a lot of people who have bought big chunks of land and are trying to restore it back to nature, this bill provides the opportunity to work within this market and to help their neighbours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a very mixed land ownership in my electorate. There are tree changers, who see this as an opportunity to restore country. There are the now significant holdings of our First Nations people. There are big farmers, including many of the next generation coming through, who will see this bill as a real opportunity to set up an alternative income stream at the same time as restoring biolinks. Then there are the not-for-profit organisations that will see this as an opportunity to partner with and help landholders. There is a lot of good work already going on in so many of our electorates, and this bill will enhance that work. It will supersize what we're already doing. It will unlock so much opportunity and incentivise what we're already doing. I note, also, that the role of local government is critically important. The City of Greater Bendigo owns a significant amount of land in my electorate, as does the Mount Alexander Shire Council and the Macedon Ranges Shire Council. Their ability to tap into this market will help them with their own offsets work that they're doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for biodiversity certificates to ensure integrity and actual environmental improvements. That is a critical point that I want to end on. Integrity is key to environmental outcomes. Australians want us to do more to protect our natural environment; they want to see its restoration. When we talk about being in a climate change emergency, we also need to talk about being in an environmental emergency. We really are playing catch-up in restoring country, restoring land, going back beyond what it looked like before the gold rushes, in my part of the world, and before we had settlement in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at better ways to partner with the people that are willing, and that is the other critical point: this is optional. This is about those who want to get involved in being part of a positive solution. This is about having integrity in a carbon credit system, making sure that we repair nature in a positive way. This bill will reward those who are doing the right thing by nature. I know that groups in my electorate are really keen to see this bill passed and the scheme established. Whether it's the biolinks, which will be able to help to co-ordinate the work, First Nations people, building on the work they're already doing, or the many farmers who are already trying to do this work and tapping into the expanded program, the Nature Repair Market Bill will help incentivise that work and ensure it continues. It demonstrates how we as a government are supporting landholders, farmers, First Nations people and communities to do the right thing by our natural environment—plant the species that we need, repair the riverbeds and the lands that need it, and remove the invasive species. It's a good bill, and I can't wait to see it pass the parliament so it can help people in our communities do more of the good work they're already doing.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  In my electorate of Paterson we are privileged to be surrounded by some of the best natural assets that nature can provide. We have the magnificent rolling hills, mountains and ranges of the Hunter Valley, and we have the beautiful sand and beaches of Port Stephens. We've always been aware of our environment and put value in it. We know that under those opposite, sadly, our environment was allowed to deteriorate. They received report after report providing evidence of its deterioration but chose to not do enough and, in some cases, even tried to cover that up, which is just not good enough. But I don't want to talk about what has gone by; I want to talk about the future. I don't want to talk about blatant disregard for things like climate change and its effects; I want to remain positive and talk about what we are doing, and what we can do, on the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A future that respects our world, and understands that simple and effective changes by the Australian government now, can help in so many ways, not only at a hyper-local level or a national level but also by helping our Pacific neighbours that are being terribly affected by climate change on their lands as well. The Albanese Labor government is delivering on its <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Positive Plan</span> with the establishment of the nature repair market. For all intents and purposes we're putting in place a market that puts value on nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's land and sea by 2030. It's a shared goal in lock step with the UN Convention on Biodiversity, and it's great news for my electorate—a community that relies on farming and agriculture. It relies on sea farming, like oysters, and fishing. It relies on tourism from the thousands of people who come to Port Stephens and the surrounding areas to enjoy the beauty of the land and the wonder of the sea, including getting up close to those majestic whales that are currently making their way up the Australian east coast. It is a sight to behold, to stand on a cliff to watch a humpback breach, but if you're lucky enough to be in a boat just out of Nelson Bay it's just incredible. It really puts everything in your life in perspective when you see those enormous creatures very close by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this nature repair market is not only about the environment. It's also about the positive economic impact it's going to have on our local businesses and the way it's going to help out our local farmers as well. As someone who has a few acres, I know how soul-crushing it can be to try and stay on top of things like lantana and blackberry. Not particularly on my place, but on neighbours' properties and throughout the broader Hunter region, I know that if you're dealing with incredibly invasive species, whether they be weed, wild boars, rabbits or foxes, they can have a terrible, terrible impact on your land, and that's what this bill is really about. It is about helping Australians, whether they're environmental people who might be involved in land care, local community groups or farmers who just want to get a bit of a hand, a bit of a clear run, on trying to restore their properties, trying to create some biodiversity and trying to create some corridors for nature, which we know is so important. This bill is a critical part of that plan to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government will make it easier for people to invest in activities that help reverse environmental decline and ensure nature repair. It simply won't be enough to stem the tide. We must start reversing the decline and ensuring positive repair to our environment. Every one of us should want to leave the environment in a better place for our next generation than it was when we inherited it. The Nature Repair Market Bill will make it easier for businesses, organisations and individuals to invest in projects to protect and also repair and reinstate nature. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm so pleased to be speaking on it today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market is going to be based on science—it won't be some sort of feelgood weeding group. It is really going to be important that we base it on science. Establishing the market in legislation will ensure its ongoing integrity, encourage investment and drive environmental improvements across the country. We need significant investments in conservation and restoration to reverse the environmental decline we've watched over the past years. We need to really be encouraging people—farmers, landholder groups and businesses—to get involved in this market, because it is going to make a massive difference. All landholders, including First Nations and Torres Strait Islander peoples, conservation groups, and farmers—if you're out there listening to this speech, you can be involved in the nature repair market. There is going to be support and funding involved to restore your properties and areas that you may have a deep interest in locally. Projects will deliver long-term, nature-positive outcomes through activities such as weeding, planting and pest control, including for feral pests. It includes our lakes and rivers as well as the land. Groups like the Slow Food Market in my electorate: g'day Amarell and all the wonderful slow foodies that get along to the market, including the farmers; the Anna Bay Landcare Group in Birubi, a terrific group doing an amazing job up there over those rolling sands, keeping those dunes going well; Shoal Bay Beach Preservation Committee; Tilligerry Habitat—what a magical place that is, if you ever get a chance to go. These are magnificent parts of Australia. Community groups like these in my electorate work tirelessly. They literally work their fingers to the bone caring for our environment. I want to send a shoutout to the men's sheds who build habitat boxes and bird-breeding boxes that are often installed in these habitats to help native birds in particular breed and continue life. It's so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give a shoutout to local councils, who work really hard to do their part to ensure a sustainable future and the nature reserves that we have across the electorate. It is important work, and this is a really important bill. For the first time, I'm just so happy to be seeing that we are creating a market for nature. I know it's so important because, in recent times, as chair of the agriculture committee, I've spent a lot of time talking not only to my local farmers and landholders but also to farmers and landholders right across the country, particularly people conducting a lot of cutting-edge research in this field. We're now talking about a thing called natural capital. It is where we place value on nature on our properties, as well as on things like the soil and the biodiversity in soil. It's not just about the idea of fertilising all the time but also about building capacity and carbon capture in the soil. Soil is one of the most incredible things. I'm delighted to be a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Soil, and I want to give a big shoutout to Penny Wensley, who does an amazing job as the National Soils Advocate. It's things like this that are so important. That's where this bill will come in. We're going to be increasing the value of our soil not just in monetary terms but also in terms of farming, nature and biodiversity. There's a lot of work to do, but at least we're making a start on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is going to support landholders, especially farmers. I know how hard it is for farmers to try to stay on top of invasive species like blackberry and lantana—the array of weeds! You've only got to go down to your local DPI and get one of those amazing brochures to see what you're up against if you have a few acres and you're trying to keep the place weed-free. There's fireweed—a whole range of things that just take over pastures before you can blink an eye. This is where people locally say to me: 'We just need a hand with this stuff. We need to be able to get some support.' That's what this bill is going to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also supports collaboration for the environmental entrepreneurs and passionate conservationists. I think it's a good thing to make investments with confidence in these shared efforts. We know that there are a lot of who have philanthropic desires around nature and want to contribute to something like this, so we're providing a legitimate pathway for those people to do that. We understand that around 60 per cent of our country's landmass is privately owned and the key majority of this is controlled by farmers and our First Nations communities. We know that they're already magnificent custodians of the land. You won't get anyone working harder and loving the land more than our farmers and our First Nations people, and this is really going to be a key change for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data shows that a large percentage of critically endangered habitats rest on privately owned land or occupied land as well. You cannot successfully reverse decline in our environment without investments in private land rehabilitation, and that's what this market is about. Transparency is going to be core to the scheme because we don't want people ripping it off and rorting it. It's got to be found to be legitimate. There will be comprehensive information available for projects. There will be certificates and a public register. It will be above board. It will be effective. It will be all the things that people want to be able to have faith in, restoring nature whilst having a properly functioning market as well. It's going to enable parliament and the public to monitor the scheme too. This is really where the rubber hits the road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drawing from last month's budget, we're delighted to have secured crucial funding to preserve the exquisite natural treasures of Australia along with their devoted custodians. We've allocated $262.3 million to support our majestic Commonwealth national parks. That's all part of this as well. This new funding will go towards refurbishment or substitution of worn-out infrastructure and it will also ensure our devoted staff have the resources to enact threatened species protection, amplifying opportunities for our First Nations community in both employment and business, amongst other benefits. We're also investing $163.4 million towards the Australian Institute of Marine Science. This funding will ensure that continued contribution is made to providing world-class scientific research for our oceans, including, of course, the big jewel in the crown: the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just a number of gestures showing our unwavering commitment to preserving the splendour of the Australian environment, whether it be the world-renowned Great Barrier Reef, Wallis Creek in the Hunter, the Broken Back Range or those magnificent dunes that just go on and on when you drive to Birubi. The local legend was that we used to sell that sand to Hawaii. I'm not quite sure if we still do, but I tell you it's absolutely well worth bottling that beautiful sand at Birubi. I know how many people want to go there and enjoy it. That's why bills like this are going to be helping to preserve that beautiful local ecosystem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of all of this, we've put $45.2 million aside for the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. I think that's pretty important too because we know how many people go to Sydney from across the world. We have to address the pressing backlog of maintenance needs around Sydney Harbour such as deteriorating sandstone walls and docks and the stabilisation of sea walls. Although this is not directly in my electorate, I can see the benefit in this because Sydney is obviously the entry point for a lot of people who come up to Port Stephens to look at our beautiful waterways up there and who come to the Hunter more generally. So I think that's very happy news.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In another significant move, we're investing a substantial $236 million to establish a comprehensive and dependable natural flood warning system. This is not just a line item in the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to say this resonates deeply with all of us from the Hunter region. In my electorate of Paterson, in cities like Maitland, we've had increased challenges with flooding. We are going to facilitate, purchase and upgrade essential monitoring equipment, ensuring that our communities in flood-prone areas are better prepared and supported in the face of potential natural disasters. I'm really excited about this. We're going to improve those flood gauges. There will be more of them in areas like Maitland, Dungog and further afield, where people have had terrible consequences because of flooding. This is another fantastic initiative. I'm so excited. I want to thank Minister Plibersek and the experts involved. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023. The Hunter electorate is lucky to be filled with beautiful nature. We have dense bush and native plants and animals, including rare native birds, and we have the largest saltwater lake in the Southern Hemisphere. As a father of two young girls, I want to make sure that we leave our land and nature, as a whole, better off for them and for their children. To achieve this, nature needs to be looked after, and, where it is damaged, we must try and repair it. This is why this government is making it easier for people to invest in activities that help repair nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're supporting landholders, including farmers and First Nations communities, to do practical things that will make a real difference in the preservation of our natural world, things like plant native species, repair damaged riverbeds or remove invasive species. We're also making it easier for businesses and philanthropists to invest in those efforts, because anyone who wants to help the environment should, and now they will have more ways to make a difference through these simple, achievable measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the nature repair market is all part of this government's commitment to delivering on our Nature Positive Plan. We've committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australian land and seas by 2030. This is in line with what has been adopted globally under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. These goals further reinforce the findings of the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the Environment</span> report, which told a devastating story of environmental loss and inaction. We are the government who released this report. Those opposite hid it, and it's easy to see why. It didn't make those opposite look good at all when it comes to looking after the environment. It painted a crystal-clear picture of exactly how much damage that lot, over a decade of neglect towards the environment, did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The results are damning. Australia has lost more mammal species to extension than any other continent, and, for the first time, Australia has more foreign plant species than native, largely due to the fact that in between the years 2000 and 2017 habitat the size of Tasmania was cleared. Our waterways were hurting too. Water is the single most important element for human existence, and the continued survival of the human race is not considered to be worth time or attention to those opposite. Our oceans are full of plastic. Up to 80,000 pieces of plastic are found per square kilometre, and flow in most Murray-Darling rivers has reached record-low levels.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know those opposite never cared. It was made clear by their actions and their inactions. They axed climate laws, failed to land a single one of their 22 different energy policies and failed to fix Australia's broken environment laws, despite having a widely supported blueprint to do so. They promise $40 million for Indigenous water but never delivered a drop. They cut highly protected areas of marine parks in half and cut billions from our environment department. They also did some things just to make themselves look good—like setting recycling targets with no plan to actually deliver them. The recycling target was 70 per cent, but it didn't even get passed 16 per cent for four years. It was one of either two things: incompetence or inaction. I'll let you decide which one, Deputy Speaker Claydon.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that our neighbours, the Pacific islanders, are under serious threat by rising sea levels. This is understandably one of the most important issues for Pacific governments, so important that, because of the inaction of the previous government, a wedge between us and our important friends in the Pacific was formed. The now Leader of the Opposition doesn't care. He laughed about our Pacific island neighbours going underwater. This just tops off the carelessness of those opposite. You'd think the election would have been a wake-up call, but they're no better in opposition than they were in government before they lost their prized blue-ribbon traditional coalition-supportive seats.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Last Friday I welcomed the shadow assistant minister for mental health and suicide prevention to my electorate. The Gold Coast is an absolutely amazing place to live but, as in other areas right across Australia, we have people of all ages who are living with mental health issues and, sadly, families who have experienced the terrible loss of a loved one to suicide. In fact, suicide has been reported as the eighth leading cause of death on the Gold Coast. The latest statistics show that 19 per cent of the Gold Coast's population are prescribed a mental health-related medication; that's one in every five.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Suicide Prevention Australia reports suicide rates are rising, with 30 per cent of people from middle-income households experiencing suicidal behaviour in the past 12 months. Certainly, the feedback we got at the roundtable and what I get almost every day in my electorate of McPherson on the Gold Coast is that financial pressures are adding enormously to mental health issues. There's no doubt that the cost-of-living crisis is hurting, and hurting a lot of people. Instead of reducing access to mental health services, the government needs to be doing much more. I certainly want to thank the practitioners, the service providers and the local residents who spoke with us last Friday and relayed their experiences. Your work is so important. We appreciated your insights and we will keep advocating for more support.</span>

It was inaugurated in 1976, making Victor the longest-serving presenter of a Spanish-language program on community radio in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victor has led a remarkable life. He came to Australia as a refugee from the Pinochet regime in Chile. Later this year we will recognise the 50th anniversary of the terrible coup. His political activism for justice and democracy in Chile resulted in his persecution by the regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since arriving in Australia, Victor has dedicated himself to service to his community. His service has been rightly recognised. In 2021, the Mexican government recognised Victor with the Ohtli Award, one of the highest awards the Mexican government can present to non-citizens of Mexico. He has provided enormous support for the Latin American diaspora. Additionally, Victor will receive life membership of the Australian Labor Party at the ACT conference later in July this year. Victor's record of service to the community is exemplary, and I'm pleased to be able to pay tribute to him.</span>

Forty years ago, a 17-year-old hopeful young man from a Greek migrant family left Liverpool, Sydney, in a Kombi van and headed north to look for a new life, as so many of us did who now live on the Gold Coast. He found the opportunities that would deliver a future in Surfers Paradise. His determination to get ahead and passion for the entertainment industry saw him and his wife build and lose their empire several times by being willing to take a risk. They are the creators of the sensational show <span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">anpower Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are so successful in Las Vegas that they have received the keys to the city, an honour bestowed upon the likes of Elvis and Sinatra. I'm proud of the story of Billy and Jackie Cross and their family, for what they have built. The secrets to their success are vision, determination, the entrepreneurial spirit and hard work with family values. They are the quintessential Gold Coast success story, and we love it. We wish them well with the next stage of their show, going to Nashville, United States.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  On 3 June, the City of Wollongong RSL Sub-Branch hosted a rededication commemorative service for the centenary of the Wollongong Cenotaph at MacCabe Park war memorial. The Wollongong Cenotaph lists the names of 360 local veterans lost in the war. I was pleased to join the Governor of New South Wales, Her Excellency the Hon. Margaret Beazley; the member for Wollongong, Paul Scully MP; Lord Mayor Gordon Bradbery; and Deputy Lord Mayor Tania Brown to lay wreaths and unveil the rededication plaque. Bravo Company, 4th/3rd Battalion, of the Royal New South Wales Regiment provided a catafalque party, while the HARS Aviation Museum conducted a historical aircraft flyover during the Call of the Fallen section of the service. Beautiful hymns and anthems were also performed by the Wollongong Conservatorium of Music's Chamber Choir.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rededication was a truly historical event in our city, and I want to thank the City of Wollongong RSL Sub-Branch for their dedication to veterans in our area. Thank you to the executive committee—John Sperring, Derek Howard, Darren Wheeler and Peter Lipscomb—and general committee members Joshua Neden, Damian Ryan, Terry Presland, Kelly Gallagher, Kurt Gallagher, Sam Barlow and Nathan Szabo. A special recognition must be given to the honorary secretary, Peter Lipscomb, who worked tirelessly organising the restoration in preparation for the ceremony. Thank you to the local stonemason, Brad Rimmer, who conducted the restoration with the utmost care and respect for this special place of history.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I've been a renter my entire adult life. I know what it's like to cop an unfair rent increase. I know what it's like to ask for basic repairs and get evicted as a result. And I know what it's like to lose a home you thought you could live in for years. But, frankly, I've had it easy, and there are millions of renters out there right now who are one rent increase away from eviction or financial stress—the pensioner who knows that they are one rent increase away from living on the streets, the family who know that, as a result of those rent increases, they'll have to pull their kid out of the local school because they can't afford to live in the local area. Those are the people whose lives are being destroyed right now because the Labor Party is so committed to enshrining unlimited rent increases in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a wealthy country. Australia is a country that is meant to pride itself on giving everyone the basics they need to live a good life. That is why the Greens are fighting so hard. It was the Greens who stood up for months, being accused by the Labor Party of standing in the way, and actually what we did was secure $2 billion in funding for social housing. Now we're going to use that power to make sure those renters out there are able to live in dignity and know that there are limits on rent increases, a freeze on rent increases, which will allow them to go and live a good life.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Recently I met with Marie-Christine Lamy and her five-year-old daughter, Isabelle. Isabelle has been diagnosed with Rett syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting speech, coordination and the use of one's hands. As a result, Isabelle is dependent on an augmentative and alternative communication device, better known as an AAC device, to assist with her reading. Most digital books, reading platforms and mobile apps are not compatible with this device. With the right AAC features, people with physical print disability can turn the page at their own pace and as independently as possible. So Marie-Christine initiated a campaign titled '#canturnthepage'. The campaign seeks to modify the definition of a person with a disability in the Copyright Act and bring it in line with the definition set by the UN's World Intellectual Property Organization in 2013 and referred to as article 3(c) of the Marrakesh treaty. As part of the campaign, a petition has been signed by 137 people calling for the review of the definition of a person with a disability. It seems to me to be a non-controversial and sensible thing to do. I now table the petition, which has been considered by the Petitions Committee and found to be in order.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Marrakesh Treaty is an international treaty that was adopted almost 10 years ago, on 27 June 2013, to facilitate access to copyright material for people with print disability. There are 3 main types of print disability; learning, visual and physical. People with physical print disability, who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices to not only communicate but learn with, do not currently have access to a variety of mainstream books on their preferred devices. With the right AAC features, people (including my 5 year old daughter) with physical print disability can turn the page at their own pace and as independently as possible. To achieve this, the current definition of a "person with a disability" in the Copyright Act 1968 needs to be clarified as it doesn't specifically acknowledge physical print disability, that renders a person unable to hold or manipulate a book, as mentioned in the Marrakesh Treaty. We hope the new definition will give proper recognition to people with print disability and, ultimately, help raise awareness on the need to make a wide variety of mainstream books accessible on all AAC devices and with added AAC features. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to review the definition of a "person with a disability" (Part II—Interpretation) in the Copyright Act 1968 and include "difficulty physically accessing" so it recognises people who have low and limited physical mobility as per Article 3(c) of the Marrakesh Treaty.</span>

The Philippines Australian Society for Senior Citizens Inc., or PASSCI, celebrated Independence Day at Our Lady of Rosary hall in Fairfield with cultural dance and food.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't know this but the Filipino community has two independence days, one on 4 July, which marks the end of the American occupation in 1946, and the other on 12 June to celebrate the day the island broke free from Spanish rule in 1898. The Filipino see 12 June as their rightful day of independence. There are more than 3,400 residents of Filipino heritage in our Fowler community, and I hope they had a wonderful celebration of independence with their families—and, rest assured, I know the feeling!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Slovenian Australian community also celebrated their independence day on 25 June to mark the day the country broke free from Yugoslavia in 1991 to be an independent state. It was wonderful to be in the company of His Excellency the Ambassador of the Republic of Slovenia, Mr Marko Ham; Mark Stariha, the New South Wales Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Slovenia; and local dignitaries, including the Mayor of Fairfield, Frank Carbone; President of the Triglav subcommittee of Mounties Group Director, Peter Krope, and Dale Hunt, CEO of the Mounties Group. It was a great weekend. I thank the communities for giving me these opportunities.</span>

Thankfully for me, my electorate has no shortage of great burger restaurants. Today I rise to congratulate one of those restaurants, one of my favourites, Burgerfiend of Cessnock. Burgerfiend was recently awarded the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Food Guide's</span> reader's choice award for the best burgers in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley. This is the fourth time Burgerfiend has won this award, also winning in 2019, 2020 and 2022 as well. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matt and Marlene from Burgerfiend are Cessnock royalty in my books. The restaurant has previously won other awards too, such as a local small business award for best takeaway in 2019 and in 2022. I have to say that all these awards are well deserved. All the burgers at Burgerfiend are delicious but my favourite is the Cheeky Fiend, which is two 100 per cent Australian beef patties—fresh not frozen—double cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato, bacon and a Burgerfiend sauce. For the vegetarians and the vegans out there is the Shroom and also Clewsy Says No and they are quite delicious as well.</span>

His name is Mick Simpson, a former truck driver. Mick is quiet, humble and full of energy. He is also a recipient of the Campaspe Shire Council's senior citizen of the year award and is a Victorian Senior Citizen of the Year Award. He won't tell me exactly how senior he is but he is a senior citizen. What makes him so inspirational is at the moment he is on a walk from Kyabram to Melbourne, 184 kilometres, to raise awareness for dementia. Mick was diagnosed with dementia some years ago and he has made it his mission over the past years to raise awareness about dementia. He has done walks previously, but, at the moment, this senior gentleman is pounding the pavement between Kyabram and Melbourne. People are greeting him along the way. I had the honour, along with Victoria Nationals leader, Peter Walsh, of walking those first few steps with him. He will be met in Parliament House in Melbourne by many parliamentarians. He hopes to raise $20,000 to assist the work of the Shepparton and Campaspe dementia group.</span>

Dementia Australia estimates more than 1.5 million people in Australia are involved with the care of living with someone with dementia and I honour Mick for bringing this to people's attention.</span>

It is incredibly inspiring to be in a room with these young people who are going to represent our country, in a competition with 80 other countries, in science—biology, chemistry, earth sciences, informatics, mathematics and physics. I was even more proud to meet young Alex Park from Werribee Secondary College, in my electorate, who, as a member of that team, with three other students, is going to compete in the biology section of the olympiad. Alex is a fabulous young person. He came to this country as a three-year-old from Korea. I met his dad today, and I met his grandmother, who'd flown in from Korea to be here on this special occasion. Alex is 17, studying year 12, and he'll be leaving our shores next week to go to the UAE to compete against students from 80 other countries. I know how proud the Werribee Secondary College community are of Alex's achievement so far. The principal, Amanda Mullins, was here today to help celebrate. Go Alex! Our whole community is behind you. Australia will be barracking hard for you in the biology competition. Most importantly, stay open-minded, make friends and enjoy science.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  According to Egg Farmers of Australia, egg farmers produce 17 million eggs every single day to feed Australian families. Queensland supplies about 25 per cent of the eggs in Australia, with egg farming generating $244 million at the farm gate in Queensland alone. In my electorate of Flynn, Smalls Trading Co., a poultry farm at Mount Morgan, has been operating since 1959. The poultry farm began with Kevin and Doreen Small, when Kevin bought some hens to combat nutgrass. In 1976, Nadine Goody, with her brother Gary Small and their siblings, Robert Small and Leanne Hinchcliffe, entered into a business partnership with their parents. After more than 60 years of producing eggs loved by customers across Central Queensland and beyond, in places like Rockhampton, Yeppoon, Gladstone, Biloela and Moura and as far as Mackay, Nadine Goody and Gary Small have made the decision to sell their family business. I'm pleased to see that the local business has been purchased by Peacefield Farms and the business should run as normal. I met Nadine and Gary in 2021 and saw firsthand the fantastic operation that they run. I would like to wish Nadine and Gary all the best for their well-deserved retirement and thank them for their commitment, feeding our region and beyond with that much loved food staple, eggs.</span>

If there's one thing that Johnny Lee loved more than the Labor Party, it was his beloved Maritime Union of Australia. I met John approximately 14 years ago down at Browse Basin on a leadership training course. Over a week of training, I formed a very close bond with him. He left a lasting impression on me but also on a lot of the other participants in that course. That was how John was. He left a lasting impression on everyone he was around, whether that was fellow seafarers in the Maritime Union or people he met through his day-to-day interactions. I know there is a person in the other place, Senator Nita Green, who he worked with closely on her election campaign recently, and they formed a very close bond. That's what John did.</span>

The cost of power feeds into all of that cost structure for my dairy farmers and agricultural producers. Every business in Warragul incurs the cost burden of increased power prices, which we have seen grow over many years. In fact, as long as we have promoted more renewables, it seems to me, prices have gone up, not down. In a cost structure on a dairy farm particularly, where your cost of production is not only the feed you have to put out but the fertiliser you've got to put in, the way you've got to run your farm, the expertise needed these days—power costs for dairy farmers are crucial to the input. It makes everything dearer for all of us if the price it costs to produce milk is ever-increasing because of increased power prices in this country. Here's to my dairy farmers working in the snow today. They have to milk the cows every day, and they do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  A secure home is the foundation for a better future. All Australians have a right to a roof over their head, but for too many housing is simply just unaffordable, including here in Canberra where we have some of the highest housing costs in the country. That's why the Albanese Labor government is taking action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the weekend the Prime Minister announced that the Australian Capital Territory will receive an extra $50 million from the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator payment. These new funds will be provided to the territory with the flexibility to use this funding to build new homes, expand existing programs or renovate currently uninhabitable housing stock. The goal is clear: to create thousands of homes for those on social housing waiting lists and increase housing supply sooner rather than later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's not all the government is doing. This $2 billion investment brings our government's total investment in housing and homelessness to more than $9.5 billion this financial year. Our Housing Australia Future Fund, which is currently being held up in the Senate, would be building year-on-year sustainable funding into Australian homes—30,000 in the first five years. But today the Greens have teamed up with the coalition to further delay this incredibly important bill. Every day of delay means an additional $1.3 million that won't be invested in housing. It is beyond belief that anyone in this place would stand in the way of new housing— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  On any given Saturday morning in winter, the sound of junior netballers and their supporters can be heard far from the courts. Club netball continues to grow from strength to strength in our region, with the Northern Tasmanian Netball Association now reaching more than 1,500 members across 13 clubs. With junior, senior and causal rosters, plus carnivals and two northern based statewide teams, playing and training currently occurs across various venues in the region, including Hoblers Bridge and the Silverdome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a proud patron of the NTNA, I've worked closely with their director, Jacinta, and her team over the past few years to identify possible locations for a new indoor facility that would provide long-term solutions. Jacinta told me last year: 'We're at capacity and cannot grow. We already do not meet the numbers that we have.' Having advocated heavily to the Tasmanian government to work with the NTNA and Netball Tasmania to find a suitable site, I'm thrilled that netball will have a permanent home at the Northern Suburbs Recreation Hub, with four indoor courts to be constructed. Having fought for and secured the $15 million to establish the multipurpose hub in the 2019 federal election, I welcome the Tasmanian government's investment of an additional $27 million that will see construction begin next year on the hub. Netball is just one sport in the region that has struggled to find suitable court space over the past few years, and I'll continue to work with other sporting codes to ensure that they can continue to meet growing demand.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  On Saturday, I joined around 200 Moreton locals in showing our support for the upcoming referendum on creating a First Nations Voice to Parliament. The Walk for Yes happened on a gorgeous morning, with the sun shining and people walking to show their commitment towards a First Nations Voice becoming enshrined in our Constitution. It was an uplifting experience. I know it will be these community people who decide the success of the referendum in the last quarter of this year. It will be the people's voices that will get this referendum over the line. It's the discussions they'll have with their families, their friends, their neighbours and at their community and sporting groups and clubs that will hold sway, that will win the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was comforted to see such a diverse range of ages, from students and P&amp;C reps from Yeronga State High School through to grandparents and everyone in between. It was great to hear why they're supporting the Voice and to also set them the challenge of starting more conversations. These personal interactions can be used to combat the mistruths and falsehoods being pedalled by the 'no' campaign and their enablers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the people of Moreton will vote yes, and I have faith in the people of Australia doing the same. But obviously, it's crucial that we have these conversations with our neighbours, with our community groups. I'll be doing my bit, as a member of parliament, but I know in Queensland there is a lot of work to do to get Queensland over the line when it comes to this referendum.</span>

This new Labor is so desperate for Greens preferences that it has sacrificed the jobs of blue-collar workers. Old Labor MPs would have had the guts to stand up and fight for blue-collar workers, but no-one is standing up to Premier Dan Andrews. The Prime Minister stands at the dispatch box and claims he supports the native hardwood timber industry. The only problem is: he does nothing about it. I've never seen a more gutless Labor Party in my life, too gutless to stand up for blue-collar workers and the timber communities. It's like they've become 'the Kermit Party'; they're trying to be greener than the Greens! We are seeing some Labor MPs and those on the crossbench representing some of the most privileged suburbs in Australia seeking to sack workers with some of the lowest household incomes in the nation based on their total ignorance of the native hardwood timber industry. The teals, the Greens and Labor are all ganging up on blue-collar workers based on their complete ignorance of the timber industry.</span>

Speaker, your chair itself was made by craftsman David Upfill-Brown from grey box, a species of eucalyptus. Perhaps those opposite would rather have you sitting on a foldout camping chair or something made from bamboo! We will be importing more timber products if we shut down the native Australian hardwood timber industry. I've got no idea whether this new Labor Party will ever stand up for our blue-collar workers again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The music festival hosted by the Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle Catholic Schools Office saw more than 400 students perform to thousands of people over two performances. Amongst those on stage were talented students from my own electorate. From the captivating tunes of Fleetwood Mac to the dazzling performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Kinky Boots</span>, our local students showcased their exceptional abilities and left us all in awe. Their dedication and hard work have brought them to the remarkable stage of the Civic. The arts play such a vital role in our community, enriching our lives and fostering creativity.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank and acknowledge the All Saints College music teacher and creative arts leader, Eva Frize, for her incredible work. I believe she said it best when she said, 'The school's performers did their community proud.' Kids, I want you to sing like you're in the shower and dance like no-one can see you or no-one's watching, and just keep creating. You are great, you are what makes our region great and we love what you do.</span>

He should not support it because it is a complete misuse of taxpayer funds. If you want to find out more about it, I can strongly recommend this URL: 2gb.com/answer-the-question-shocker-interview-with-michelle-rowland. At the URL you'll discover a lot. You'll discover that the minister personally handpicked every site. You'll discover that 74 per cent of the sites are in Labor electorates. You'll discover that in New South Wales—a big state—there are 27 grants. How many of them are in Labor electorates? All 27.</span>

Houses are already being built. The government has provided an extra $67.5 million through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to tackle homelessness, expanded the eligibility for the Home Guarantee Scheme, increased Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent and developed a new National Housing Accord to build one million homes by 2024, including 10,000 rental properties.</span>

The Treasurer, though, is very disappointed. You're on question 1. He thought this was the moment, and it still didn't happen! The shadow Treasurer is up there, having been part of the government that presided over the highest quarterly inflation increase this century of 2.1 per cent. He also decided, while that was happening, to bring down a budget that splashed money everywhere and projected, of course, a $78 billion surplus—unlike what this government has done, which is to produce a budget under this Treasurer that projects a $4.2 billion increase.</span>

                  </a>  This is the most jobs created in the first year of any government in Australian history—the most jobs created by any new government in Australian history. We are the party of jobs, jobs and jobs, and that is confirmed. We also have wages growing, after the period in which those opposite were saying that real wage depression was a peak feature of their economic architecture. We also have the highest number of women in full-time work in Australian history. They over there have the hide, having presided over the first recession in three decades, to come in here and talk down the Australian economy. Well, we on this side will continue to promote our positive plans for economic growth, our positive plans for employment, our positive plans for an economy that works for people, not the other way around, at the same time as we're making substantial investments in social policy and making a difference, such as our announcement on Saturday of $2 billion additional funding for public housing, to make a difference to the economy so that jobs will be created, so that people will have a place to live—a sort of commitment that would never be made by any coalition commitment.</span>

She understands, as many do, that today is a big day—as big as Uluru—because today the Senate has passed the Constitution alteration bill without amendment. This is the final hurdle to holding a referendum later this year on constitutional recognition through the Voice. The race to recognition is on. We are one step closer to finally recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our nation's founding document, one step closer to giving a voice to Indigenous Australians. Today the political debate ends, and we can start a national conversation at the community level about what the Voice is, why it is needed and how it will make a practical difference.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge today our famous Essendon legend in the gallery, Michael Long, who joins us here. Thank you for your advocacy, Michael, ahead of the referendum. As you say, the Voice will have a ripple effect of change for the better. I also acknowledge representatives from Darwin in the gallery. To those Australians who want to know more, I say this: the Voice is a huge opportunity to take Australia forward. It is our chance to do something practical that can help us close the gap. Last week we saw new data. Four of the 19 targets are on track—just four. Life expectancy is not on track. Indigenous babies born at a healthy birth weight is not on track. Indigenous people finishing year 12 is not on track. If we needed any more evidence that more of the same isn't good enough, this is it. We have to do things better, and that's where the Voice to Parliament can help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A resource of local knowledge, it will be chosen by Aboriginal people. It will be about health, education and housing—things that directly affect Aboriginal people. But, instead of listening, we've spent years and probably billions of dollars on poor outcomes. This is the chance to change that. This is about listening and recognition. Let's fulfil the promise of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Let's make 2023 the year of the Voice. Let's vote 'yes' to recognition, unify this country, grow it up and make us all proud to be Australians.</span>

Fancyleaf is a lettuce farm in Morayfield in my electorate of Longman. Their power bills have more than doubled since the same time last year. The price of the stock they buy has increased dramatically, and they are now paying a fuel surcharge to receive that stock. These costs will have to be passed on to consumers, who are already struggling. When will the Prime Minister take responsibility for making things worse for Middle Australia?</span>

What we have done is to put in place measures that the member for Longman voted against. He voted against $3 billion of energy price relief. The member would be aware, as well—and I got this question from another Queenslander last week—that the Queensland budget that was handed down just a week ago, in partnership with the work that we have done, will make an enormous difference. It will mean, literally, that, for many pensioners and low-income Queenslanders, their energy bills will be zero going forward.</span>

That stands in stark contrast to the 22 policies announced by those opposite, of which they didn't land one—the fact that they took four gigawatts out of the system but only put one gigawatt in and the fact that they left Australia with a national energy grid that was built for the last century. They promised in 2019, including this former minister across here, the member for Hume, to reduce wholesale electricity price to less than $70 per megawatt hour by the end of 2021. That's what he promised. He promised $70. Instead, it was $286. He promised to spend $1 billion to pump an additional 3,800 megawatts of electricity into the grid, but instead guess how much he spent? Zero. Not a single watt, let alone a kilowatt, went into the system. These are the mob that masterminded a national oil reserve 14,000 kilometres away in Texas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:12</span>):  I thank the member for Macnamara for his question. Today is an historic day. A bill to amend the Constitution has passed the Australian parliament, and this means that, later this year, the Australian people will have their say on whether to recognise the First Peoples of Australia through an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice enshrined in our Constitution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The referendum will be about two things. First, it's about recognising that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have occupied the Australian continent for more than 60,000 years and represent the oldest continuing living cultures in human history. They've maintained a relationship with Australia's lands, waters and skies since time immemorial. The Australian Constitution has never recognised the unique status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of this country. The time has come to do precisely that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, this referendum is about listening to the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples about the laws and policies that affect them. We know that we must do better to address the unacceptable gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We must do better to reduce the shockingly high incarceration rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, the poor health outcomes and the lower life expectancy. We know that better policies are made when they are shaped by those most affected. We know because we've seen the evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The words of the proposed amendment to the Constitution are simple and they are powerful. The words of the proposed amendment are the product of a comprehensive process of consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and the best legal minds in the country, including the Solicitor-General. I thank the Referendum Working Group, the Referendum Engagement Group and the Constitutional Experts Group, and I applaud my colleagues the Minister for Indigenous Australians and Senator Patrick Dodson for their extraordinary work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Solicitor-General has stated very clearly that the Voice is 'not just compatible with the system of representative and responsible government prescribed by the Constitution, but an enhancement of that system'. So, the short answer the member's question is that the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice is an important addition to the Constitution because it will make our Constitution better. This referendum can be a unifying moment for our country, and I believe it will be a unifying moment. It's a unique opportunity to address the injustices of the past and to create change that will deliver a better future.</span>

The government is committed to implementing all 28 recommendations from Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins's review into Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. Parliament House will never be a typical workplace, but it must be a safe workplace, a respectful workplace, a workplace that lives up to the ideals that our democracy is built on: equality, fairness, decency and respect for all. It must also be a workplace worthy of the nation and the people we are called here to serve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the parliament endorsed new draft codes of conduct. This was a historic moment, and we're working across the parliament to establish the enforcement of the codes as a priority. All parliamentarians and staff should already be complying with those codes of conduct and the new behaviour standards for everyone who works in parliament. Behaviour that would not be accepted in workplaces across the country should certainly not be accepted here in this parliament. To help drive cultural change, we expect to have a keystone reform of the Jenkins report—an independent statutory HR agency—up and running from October this year, with cooperation from across the parliament. We're also working to establish an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission and to implement recommendations of the review of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act as quickly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the member, with regard to timing—we will do it as soon as we can, but we want to make sure that we get it right and we also want to make sure that we have the full input of people across the parliament, and ownership of people across the parliament. These reforms do require that cooperation, and we continue to work, through the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, to secure this cooperation. We're also prioritising close consultation with staff as we implement these reforms. We know that staff can be vulnerable in these workplaces, and it's critical that we make sure that these reforms work in the interests of our staff. The government is committed to progressing these essential reforms and to getting them right. I look forward to working with the member for North Sydney and other members and senators to make sure we do just that.</span>

Today our parliament has said yes to holding a referendum. Now the Australian people will have a chance to say yes in a referendum that will be held in the last quarter of this year. What began at Uluru all those years ago returns to the people. It's over to you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to my fellow Australians that parliaments pass laws, but it is the people who make history. This is your time, your chance, your opportunity. It will be a moment of national unity, a chance to make our nation even greater, a gracious chapter in the story of Australia. This change isn't about detracting from the 122 years of our democracy; it's about, as the Solicitor-General said, enhancing that democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are amongst our most disadvantaged. We can't continue to do the same things and expect different outcomes. For 122 years, with the best of intentions, governments have done things for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is about doing things with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, listening to what their concerns are.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Australians are compassionate, and I know that we can do more than one thing at a time. Australians are generous enough to care about the most vulnerable amongst us, but they're also generous enough to know that helping someone else does not make their life harder. Every act of goodwill we have made as a people has been an investment in our nation, and the returns have been extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have nothing to lose by voting 'yes', but there is so much for Australia to gain. Before the apology to the stolen generation was given in this parliament 15 years ago, it was opposed, and we were told it could lead to bad outcomes, but today it is celebrated, and this will be celebrated as well. All of the changes that have been made—the Mabo decision, the pouring of sand into Vincent Lingiari's hands that is so famous, the 1967 referendum—were milestones of national progress, and this can be again. A 'yes' vote at this referendum is a chance for all of us to take the next step on the journey of reconciliation—and to take it together, because that's when we're at our best—to be part of a better and more reconciled future.</span>

Is she right?</span>

I want to see pharmacies thrive, but I'll tell you who else I care about besides the person who's the pharmacist: I care about the person who goes into the pharmacy. I care about the six million Australians who will benefit from cheaper medicines. That's what I care about. The logic that says that someone who has a permanent condition who will need a particular drug for the rest of their lives—be it for diabetes or a heart condition or other conditions—who can get a prescription for 60 days rather than 30 days should pay twice as much and should go twice as often to the doctor is, quite frankly, absurd.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:26</span>):  I thank the member for Macarthur for his question, and for his advice to this side and to the whole parliament over the last three or four years as the nation grappled with this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right through this dreadful pandemic, both Australian governments, frankly, have been particularly focused on protecting those Australians who are most at risk of severe disease or death. My predecessor Greg Hunt and his colleague Ken Wyatt worked particularly hard at protecting First Nations communities during this pandemic, working hand in hand with those communities and organisations like NACCHO. I pay credit to Greg and Ken for that work. It must be said I was more critical about the former government's slowness in securing vaccine deals in the first year or two, which meant that Australia was desperately short of Pfizer doses in the middle part of 2021 just as the delta wave was building. Indeed, in July of that year, the ATAGI advice was that Pfizer not be administered to people over the age of 50.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This background highlights why there is so much concern at reports over the weekend that the member for Leichhardt arranged for a local property developer aged in his 60s to travel to Thursday Island to receive a Pfizer dose in that very month of July; concern that it was clearly understood across the nation that this man was not eligible, on ATAGI advice, for the Pfizer vaccine; concern that he was taking a dose that was intended to protect the vulnerable members of that community on Thursday Island; and concern that unnecessary travel to First Nations communities exposed those communities to a risk of infection—a risk that had been clearly identified and articulated by Greg Hunt and Ken Wyatt, to their credit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Leichhardt's own colleagues have reported on a large donation of $304,000 from this property developer, $4,000 of which was apparently for just one dinner attended by just five people—some dinner it must have been! The member for Leichhardt's constituents will draw their own conclusions about those elements of this story, but the member does have very serious questions to answer about his actions at a time when his own government was so focused on protecting the health of vulnerable First Nations communities, including Thursday Island, and when other Australians were expected to queue patiently for short-dose vaccines—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:34</span>):  I want to thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know that he, like all of us on this side of the House and the teals over there, actually want more Australians to be in a safe, affordable place to call home. Indeed, what we announced on the weekend was a further addition to our ambitious housing agenda: we announced a $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator plan. I'm pleased to tell the member for Moreton that that means $398 million in additional funding for his home state of Queensland. I'm also pleased to tell the member for Moreton that we want to deliver that money within the next two weeks and we want it expended or contracted by the governments within two years, because we know how critical it is that we get more homes on the ground as quickly as we can. This is a broad part of our housing agenda. Just this financial year, our government is investing $9.5 billion for social and affordable housing and homelessness services. We are taking the housing challenges seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, I can't say the same for some of the other people in this place. Unfortunately and really distressingly, what we saw in the Senate today was quite dismaying for those Australians who are trying to get a safe, affordable place to call home. What we saw was the Liberal Party and the Greens teaming up to, essentially, delay and block funding for social and affordable housing. That's what we saw. This is really tragic for those Australians who are languishing on waiting lists, for those Australians who do want to find someone to call home.</span>

                  </a>  This is really deeply distressing for all of those Australians who had been relying on this funding to get more homes on the ground and for those Australians who need somewhere to live today. Can I tell the House that when we talk about delays to this fund what we're talking about is $250 million for every six-month delay. Every day of delay past 1 July is $1.3 million a day that we are not spending on social and affordable housing for Australians that need it today because those two parties teamed up against very important legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to those Australians who are doing it tough out there: we do have a broad housing agenda, and we are getting on with the job. You saw that on the weekend with our significant announcement, with the $575 million we announced last year, with our Housing Accord and with our changes in the last budget. This government is being very serious about getting more homes on the ground and getting more Australians into safe, affordable homes. It's a shame we can't say that about some of the people in this place.</span>

In relation to the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, we have been extraordinarily clear, and we have listened to the aspirations of First Nations Australians through an engagement group, through a working group and through many discussions on the ground in local communities, as well as the expert legal group. I have spoken at length with my colleagues and spoken at length with many people in this House. The answer to the question is that it is stated time and time again that the Voice will concern itself with issues that directly affect First Nations people.

She has asked three times as many questions as the member for Hume since the budget reply last month. The wasted decade in this country made our country more vulnerable to global economic uncertainty. That's true in the housing market. It's true as well in the labour market. But the Albanese government has recorded, as the PM said, the strongest jobs growth in its first year of any new government on record—more than 465,000 jobs. We've seen new analysis released today that shows that Australia is a world leader when it comes to job creation and workforce participation, well ahead of all the major advanced economies, with the highest participation rate and the strongest jobs growth since May 2022.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that what we need to do is to make sure that there are affordable homes close to where the jobs and opportunities are being created in our country. That's why building more homes has been absolutely central to our first two budgets and to our broader economic plan. I want to pay tribute to this Minister for Housing and this Prime Minister for the announcement that they made on the weekend: a $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator, which will build thousands of new homes in our country. It will mean more housing for more people in more parts of our nation, and it's part of our broad and ambitious housing agenda.</span>

                  </a>  There is the National Housing Accord and the biggest increase to Commonwealth rent assistance in 30 years. We are expanding the First Home Guarantee and Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee and increasing the liability cap of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. There is also extra funding to the states and territories through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to help tackle homelessness.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier on today, the Senate had an opportunity to advance this substantial, broad and ambitious housing agenda, and the Senate failed to grasp that opportunity. The Housing Australia Future Fund is a really important part of building more homes for more people, particularly the most vulnerable in our country, including women and kids fleeing domestic violence. It beggars belief that the Greens have teamed up with the coalition to stop those tens of thousands of homes being built. It was a big test for the Greens and the coalition in the Senate, and they failed that test.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens, in particular, give these speeches saying they support social housing, but when the crunch comes, when it comes time to put their hands up for more social housing, they put political posturing and product differentiation before the right outcomes for the most vulnerable people in our society. After the vote in the Senate today, one thing is abundantly clear: the Labor Party is trying to build more social and affordable homes; the Greens are voting with the coalition to prevent them being built. </span>

I understand the government is optimistic that Australia will not fall into a recession. In Fowler, charities are seeing unprecedented numbers of middle-income families needing help. Small businesses are struggling to keep up with increased costs and are not seeing the same level of customers. More people are now working a second job to meet the cost-of-living pressure. We're yet to feel the impact of the 12 interest rate hikes. How confident should the Australian public be that we're not heading into a recession, if we're not already in one? </span>

It is not currently the expectation of the Treasury or the Reserve Bank or a number of other credible institutions and forecasters that Australia will go down that path. But what we've tried to do on this side of the House is to be up-front about the challenges that we do confront in our economy, and we see it in the budget, before that and after that, that we do expect the Australian economy to slow considerably. This is the inevitable consequence of the interest rate rises, which began before the election and continued after, and also the substantial slowdown in the global economy. And so I say to your constituents, and I say to communities right around Australia, that what we are trying to do and what we are doing in our first two budgets is to try to provide help where we can to get your constituents and communities around Australia through a difficult and challenging period in the global and domestic economies, provide some help where we can and also lay the foundations for future growth at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the ways that we do that is to make sure we get the budget in much better nick so that we can afford to help people and so that we can invest, whether it's in energy or in technology or in the skills and capacities of our people, meaningfully in the future so that we can weather the storm which is coming at us from around the world at the same time as we lay the foundations for a better future and a stronger economy as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons we're able to do that, which would be completely unrecognisable to those opposite, is we've worked out over two budgets how do we try to get genuine value for money from these investments? That means winding back on the waste and rorts which defined the economic mismanagement on that side of the House for too long, which is one of the big reasons why we had this wasted decade in our economy. It's one of the reasons why we inherited $1 trillion worth of debt with nowhere near enough to show for it. It's why we inherited deficits as far as the eye can see. And it's why, even after a decade in office of those opposite, there were so many economic challenges for us to address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We accept responsibility for addressing the challenges in the economy. We're up-front about what's coming at us from around the world but being felt around the kitchen tables of Fowler and communities right around the country. We are prepared to work with anyone in this place who shares our objective to get people through a difficult patch at the same time as we invest in the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, I was proud to announce our new $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator—funding to be delivered to states and territories within two weeks; funding that we're able to do because we had a responsible budget going forward, that has created this space. It builds on what we've been doing so far: a National Housing Accord; increased funding for social and affordable rental housing; $2 billion to finance social and affordable rental homes through the NHFIC; the largest rent assistance increase in 30 years; and, of course, our Housing Australia Future Fund, which failed to pass today because of an unholy alliance between the coalition and the Greens—the new 'no-alition'!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we expect the Liberals to oppose public housing because they've never, ever supported it. But what we had over there with the Greens teaming up with them is working to block public housing. Let me say this: this isn't student politics. What happens here affects the country and, instead of hyperventilating like a debating team, you need to bring people together to get things done. Those in that corner deal in protests; we deal in progress. They see issues to campaign on; we see challenges to act on. They want to build their profile; we want to build more homes. Building a brand doesn't put a roof over anyone's head. Families can't take shelter under a petition. When you want work done, call for the Labor Party, because we don't stop working on things because the Greens have cold feet. We're not waiting around for them, promising the world and delivering nothing. This is what it means to lead, to govern. We keep working till we find a solution, bringing people together on a plan that works. That's what we've done, and that's what we'll continue to do, because we know that this issue is too important to wait.</span>

We should all reflect that, just on Monday, the Productivity Commission brought down a report on the Closing the Gap targets, and it told a terrible story. We are elected into this place to represent everybody, and to do that is also to understand these statistics. The life expectancy gap is not on track. It is not okay that my life expectancy is eight years shorter than the deputy's. It's not okay. It is not okay that, for children who are doing year 12, the outcomes will not be as good for First Nations students. It is not okay that babies are born at unhealthy birth weights. That is not okay. I visited a community last week where there were 30 people living in a two-bedroom unit. That is not acceptable. This is why the Voice is important. This is why it will make a practical difference on the ground. This will make a very practical difference. </span>

                  </a>  One of the incredibly important design principles of the Voice to Parliament is that it will work alongside and with existing organisations and traditional structures. The Coalition of Peaks is fundamental to the Closing the Gap targets, and the Voice will be able to work alongside the Coalition of Peaks in terms of the implementation plan. Let us remember that, when the opposition came into government last time, they cut $500 million out of the Indigenous affairs budget, and that had a devastating effect. This country does not want to see further disadvantage. The Voice is about practical outcomes and recognition, those two things. That is what you need to understand.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Canberra for her question. Of course, the Albanese government is turning the tide of 10 years of inaction by those sitting opposite and has begun to deliver our comprehensive housing agenda for Australians. We understand that people are doing it tough, particularly those renting. That's why, in last month's budget, the government invested an extra $2.7 billion to increase Commonwealth rent assistance maximum rates by 15 per cent. This is the largest increase to rent assistance in more than 30 years, and more than one million households will benefit, including pensioners, families, veterans, jobseekers and students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in my portfolio we are building more emergency accommodation for women and children experiencing family and domestic violence. Since we formed government, I have taken steps to ensure the successful delivery of a number of Safe Places projects delivering much-needed crisis accommodation on the ground for women and children escaping family and domestic violence. And we will invest a further $100 million for the Safe Places program, to deliver up to 720 more places nationally for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend, the Prime Minister, along with the Minister for Housing, announced a $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator, and through our Housing Australia Future Fund we have a plan to deliver more than 30,000 new social and affordable homes for Australians who need a safe and affordable place to call home, including 4,000 of those homes for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence and older women who are experiencing homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very comprehensive plan, and it was disappointing to see the coalition team up with the Greens to block the delivery of homes on the ground. It seems that the Liberals, the Nationals and the Greens would rather play political games than vote to deliver more social and affordable housing to Australians that need it, because voting to delay the Housing Australia Future Fund is standing in the way of delivering more housing stock for Australians who want a safe and affordable place to call home. I need to reinforce that it is only Labor that has a plan to boost Commonwealth rent assistance, to deliver emergency accommodation for women and children escaping domestic violence and to build more social and affordable housing.</span>

It's a pity that the Greens political party have chosen to make themselves irrelevant to the debate. By refusing to participate—just like the coalition do—on these issues, they can take no responsibility for anything that this government does. We will not be held back by a 'no-alition' of the Liberal Party and the Greens political party saying 'no' to public housing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have done is work with states and territories on the issue of housing supply because, yes, I understand that renters are doing it tough. Yes, I want to do things about that. Yes, that's why we have a renters' rights agreement we're working through with states and territories. What we are not doing is destroying supply while we do it, because the key to fixing housing is supply. If we did what those opposite want us to do, there will be less supply of housing going forward, and that is what they don't seem to comprehend. The fact is that those opposite have prioritised protesting, they have prioritised building up a profile, and they have prioritised politics rather than prioritising building public housing, which is why they voted in the Senate to block the bill by deferring it. At least those opposite in the Liberal Party don't pretend. They would have the guts to vote against public housing.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>I say to the Greens, for deferring this legislation yet again: they should have had the guts, as I said to the leader of the Greens this morning, to vote against it, to say that you're against 30,000 additional social housing units, including housing for women and children escaping domestic violence, including housing for veterans, and including housing for those in Indigenous communities. There are a range of things open to the government to do, policy-wise. We don't need a Senate which has decided to block everything. We will take up those options. We certainly did on Saturday in announcing $2 billion of public housing going forward. In return for that, the states and territories have agreed on planning reform. They want new zoning. And I say the challenge is that those opposite oppose every new zoning, because they have never seen a medium-density development that they supported. In my area of the Inner West Council, they voted against every affordable housing development that has occurred. So don't come in here and say you care about public housing, just vote—<span style="font-style:italic;"> (Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  He did consultations and, as part of those consultations, he discovered that veterans would like to see greater assistance on being able to access housing and homelessness supports. South Australia is blessed to have the Andrew Russell Veteran Living centre. Having a hub in the northern suburbs of Adelaide will facilitate better access to veterans' housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But not everybody is so fortunate. In fact, every year, about 6,000 contemporary veterans are at risk of homelessness. In March we learnt from the census data in 2021 that there are over 1,500 individuals that have served our nation that were homeless on census night. Veterans are three times more likely to experience homelessness than the broader population. Knowing that, in addition to what they already have in South Australia, we committed at the last election to fund the Scott Palmer centre in Darwin in the member for Solomon's electorate to support the veterans in the Northern Territory. We know that it is important to do more. Indeed, we need to maximise the opportunity of the Housing Australia Future Fund and that is exactly what we want to do as a government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the member for Spence asked an important question—that is, 'What is standing in the way?' Let me tell you what is standing in the way. In fact, I could even tell you who is standing in the way. It is the Leader of the Opposition, it is the leader of the Greens political party, it is the leader of the National Party and it is the member for Griffith. Those members of the Nationals, the Liberal Party and the Greens in the Senate are personally standing in the way of allowing us to invest $10 billion in a Housing Australia Future Fund to enable us to spend $30 million on housing to support our homeless veterans and on services to support veterans that are at risk of homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>The Leave No Veteran Behind report of last month said 'Doing nothing is just not an option'. In fact, the Tasmanian Liberal veterans' minister said, 'The Tasmanian government welcomes the commitment of the Australian government to housing our vulnerable veterans.' RSL Australia said, 'The time for action is now.' I know that Liberal Senator O'Sullivan in Western Australia met with the RAAF association, who want to also bring on housing supports for our veterans, but they can't access any funding for that because the Liberals, the National Party and the Greens are politicising this issue. They are politicising a fund and standing in the way of supporting veterans that are homeless. This is on your heads. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the Albanese government delivered on an important commitment for the local government sector by bringing back the Australian Council of Local Government to Canberra for the first time in a decade, an election commitment. We delivered on this government's promise to bring local government back to the table, an election commitment that brought together 650 local government representatives from every corner of Australia, from the Torres Strait to King Island from Kununurra to Whyalla, such is our commitment to listening to and learning from those who know their communities best, which is local government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a local government in every town, every village, every city across this country. Our solutions, we need to listen to, are locally led. Achieving net zero emissions was a significant theme across the forum, and local governments were acknowledged as leaders in this space. That's why we supported them, with the announcement of a community energies upgrade fund, a $100 million Australian government investment which will co-fund energy efficient projects across local communities, from pool heating upgrades to energy efficient lighting for sporting ovals. I want to thank Minister Bowen and Assistant Minister McAllister for this announcement, because they are listening to the sector. The forum also highlighted our refreshing approach to grant programs, new community infrastructure programs, growing regions and thriving suburbs. The forum discussed how transparent, merit based, community based programs need to be done. It also—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite really didn't value the sector, because they froze financial assistance grants, which has had a significant impact on every local council across the country, and we're still seeing that today. This side of the House have brought forward financial assistance grants to this year, and in the next couple of weeks, they will receive their entire allocation of the 2023-24 financial assistance grants, because we know how important it is to back the local government sector. We're listening to local communities through local councils. We are committed to building strong partnerships with our local governments to improve service delivery, to capitalise on our strengths and to help them tackle the big issues that are affecting their community. The clear message from local councils across the country was how refreshing it was that they now have a prime minister and a government that value their voice, that want to work with them, that are committed to the sector and that will be there for them day in, day out. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He also, I might add, made a donation of $650,000 to Queensland Health to help them prepare for COVID because the then state minister Bailey had failed to do it. He made another $80,000 donation in equipment there and even a $6,000 donation to feed the Queensland Health staff.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments relate to the tax deductibility status for entities in the upcoming referendum debate. It is something of a coincidence that we are speaking on this matter just as that item has passed the parliament. Providing tax-deductible status to organisations participating in public campaigning on the referendum allows the community to support public conversations for and against the Voice to Parliament. As the government has announced, we will not be providing public funding for either the 'yes' or the 'no' case; however, this amendment provides tax-deductible gift recipient status to a 'no' case entity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of the House I'll provide a little background on that. In the May budget, the government made a decision to provide tax-deductible gift recipient status for an organisation campaigning against the Voice to Parliament. There hadn't been any proposals for 'no' case organisations until March 2022, so the budget included the Voice No Case Committee. However, one day before the budget was published, the Voice No Case Committee informed Treasury that it was no longer seeking deductible gift recipient status. It then announced, through media statements, that it had merged to create the newly formed entity Australians for Unity, which would be the main vehicle campaigning against the Voice. That entity didn't exist until mid-April and only had its charitable status approved last Thursday. Last Friday, the Senate approved amendments which would provide Australians for Unity, the principal vehicle for campaigning for a 'no' case, with tax-deductible gift recipient status that would be backdated to 13 April.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would note, for the benefit of honourable members, that it's taken around two months for Australians for Unity to be granted tax-deductible gift recipient status. That contrasts with the process to approve tax-deductible gift recipient status for Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition, which took seven months. Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition had been working to achieve tax-deductible status since 2020. In a broader sense, its journey towards tax-deductible gift recipient status was a matter of years. The journey of the principal 'no' case Australians for Unity was simply a couple of months. The 'no' case organisation, Australians for Unity, will be listed as a tax-deductible gift recipient from 1 June 2023 to 30 June 2024. On that basis, there will be one 'yes' case vehicle with specific tax-deductible gift-recipient listing, Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition, and one 'no' case vehicle approved for tax-deductible gift-recipient listing, Australians for Unity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians will forgo the tax revenue that would otherwise have been collected on that income, but this is a considerably smaller sum than if specific funding had been provided to the 'yes' case and the 'no' case. There is balance now, with the principal 'yes' case vehicle and the principal 'no' case vehicle being entities to which tax-deductible donations can be made. In both cases, this is a time-limited tax-deductibility period. That is appropriate, given that the referendum will take place later this year. I commend the Senate amendments to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—It's going to very workmanlike, I'd say to the shadow minister. The report examined Defence's implementation of the Auditor-General's recommendations and suggested improvements to the program. National security imperatives require Defence to execute and enforce strict contractual obligations with defence industry. National security and intelligence agencies advise that foreign espionage is at an unprecedented high and that Australia's defence industrial base is a top-tier target. In this environment, there can be no room for complacency or error. The Auditor-General's report No. 4 of 2021-22, <span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">efence</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s contract administration</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">efence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Industry S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ecurity </span><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rogram</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> raised serious concerns regarding Defence's implementation of the Defence Industry Security Program and management of noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To oversimplify a really complex and, at times, eye-glazing but really critical subject, Defence has a really solid policy in place. Full marks for the strategy and the policy to have secured the defence industrial base. However, there were serious gaps identified by the Auditor-General in Defence's implementation and operationalisation—a dreadful American word if ever there was one—of that policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee carefully considered Defence's progress in implementing the six recommendations it committed to a month ago. I would commend Defence on the seriousness with which they've responded to the report and the significant increases in resources. If I recall, I think they've gone from in the order of 20 staff to around 80 staff, at least, working in the Defence Industry Security Program. And, of course, the efforts right across the public sector to secure the defence industrial base are complemented and boosted by the ongoing funding the government's provided in the last two budgets via ASIO and the Home Affairs portfolio—always lovely to see the minister here—and the countering espionage in defence threat program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… listen more carefully to industry concerns raised via this inquiry regarding the quality of DISP security training including for APS staff and embed a structured, transparent mechanism to ensure industry feedback directly informs continuous improvement to ensure training meets industry's reasonable expectations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We thank those members of the defence industry community who chose to submit to the inquiry and to appear. It is sometimes a bit difficult to get industry or businesses to submit when their comments may be seen as critical of government policy or departments. They fear putting their heads up. They may get into trouble. But they were very constructive suggestions received.</span>

I don't want to talk too fast because I want the shadow minister to be able to really reflect and focus on the words that I am conveying here on the good work of the committee. 'Noting the importance of the DISP and the inherent link to national security'—I'm sure both the minister and shadow minister take national security very seriously—'the committee will continue to take an active interest in Defence’s further improvements to DISP administration in line with its role on behalf of the parliament.' That means you, shadow minister; we work on your behalf. 'The committee recommends the following actions to occur at six and twelve months respectively.'</span>

But across this behemoth, Defence is strangely unable to identify and point to people signing contracts. They said there are over 1,000 people who sign contracts. We said, 'Well, surely, you must know who signs contracts in the Department of Defence. How can you know which contracts require DISP inclusion and clauses and, therefore, whether those people signing those contracts have the required training?' Amidst much head scratching, there has been earnest commitments to do more.</span>

I particularly acknowledge the senior officials from the Department of Defence who are not complacent about the risks and who have allocated significant extra resources—as I said before, to quote myself, 20 to 80—to DISP administration, complementing the government's ongoing investment via ASIO—I will close with one more acknowledgement of the minister over there—and others enhancing the security of the defence industrial base. I also thank the deputy chair and all the committee members for their collegiate approach, and the secretariat for their efforts in support of this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms THWAITES:</span>
                    </a>  Australians are rightly proud of our democracy and our electoral system. However, these systems are only as robust as the institutions and the frameworks that support them, and it's vital they remain trusted, relevant and fit for purpose. Our democracy is best when it is conducted in a way that is transparent and where our community feels confident that our political system and our politicians are accessible to all, not just to those capable of making very large donations. Across the Western world we see the potential for a drift from democracy when people feel like their political system isn't working for them and believe their system has been captured by vested interests. This is a trend we must work hard to avoid in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this interim report the committee considers a number of matters pertaining to the 2022 federal election, including reforms to donation laws and the funding of elections, truth-in-political-advertising laws and encouraging increased electoral participation and lifting enfranchisement of First Nations people. The committee's inquiry has received nearly 1,500 submissions, illustrating the importance in which Australians hold the electoral system. We have held nine public hearings to further examine some key questions with a wide range of stakeholders, and we have further hearings planned as we progress towards our final report. The committee is deeply appreciative of the witnesses who have appeared at those hearings to aid us in our work. The evidence we have heard has allowed the committee to develop clear goals for reform to increase transparency in election donations and curb the potentially corrupting influence of big money, to build the public's trust in electoral and political processes and to encourage participation in our elections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report makes 15 recommendations grouped around three major themes: political donations and expenditure; trust in the electoral system; and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in elections. The committee recommends lowering the donation disclosure threshold to $1,000; introducing real-time disclosure of donations; introducing donation caps and expenditure caps for federal elections; and the provision of additional resourcing to the Australian Electoral Commission to support, implement and enforce these reforms. To help restore and maintain trust in the electoral system, the committee recommends that the government introduce legislation to govern truth in political advertising and that the AEC be established as the administrator of these measures. We also recommend the government strengthen opportunities for electoral enfranchisement to increase participation in elections by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, especially in remote communities. The committee will do more work on this and other matters before we present our final report before the end of this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this interim report the committee recommends significant changes to our federal system. It is important to note that many of these reforms are not untested ideas or approaches. States and territories around Australia have grappled with the same challenges the federal system must now respond to, and they've provided models from which the Commonwealth can learn and adopt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I thank the many people who have taken the time to engage with this inquiry and our work. I thank the secretariat and my colleagues for their ongoing engagement with the important work of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The report has been strengthened by the sincere and good-faith involvement of members across the political spectrum, even when we do not agree on all topics.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  by leave—I too rise to speak to this report and, in particular, commend the dissenting report from coalition members. This report will obviously see, clearly, a number of pieces of reform—perhaps in one bill or in multiple bills—come before parliament. We, in the coalition, hold grave concerns about attempts to partially change our electoral system to favour one particular political hue. In particular, we are concerned that the government will be proposing reforms that benefit them and the union movement and their business model. Whilst they will claim the virtue of things like limiting donations and expenditure, we're very wary that the report of the majority and the potential legislation that might come forward will be about using the union movement's business model with the Labor Party and undertaking reforms that give them a particular advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Expenditure caps and donations are a really good example, and the crossbench—in particular, I hope, in the Senate—need to be alive do this. Ways of using third parties and the union movement, which will claim to be third parties in legislation—some unions are affiliated to the Labor Party; some unions aren't technically affiliated with the Labor Party. Unions will funnel money to the Labor Party through things like affiliation fees instead of donations, and when the government bring legislation forward we should be very alive to the concept of how that will allow 'funny money' to be fed into one particular party in this country outside the spirit of the claimed virtue of reforms that the government at the same time will be putting forward through that reform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see this in this report, but we've also seen it in the reforms that Labor governments have undertaken at a state level around the country. I know particular examples from my own state, but every Labor government are very consistent on these things: they're very good at looking after themselves and the union movement when they get the opportunity to undertake reform. The fact that we could see changes to our electoral system that are not about improving our democracy but are about gerrymandering financial benefit to the union movement and one particular party in our system must be resisted in the interests of our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to working as hard as I can with my coalition colleagues—but, more importantly, hopefully with those on the crossbench—to resist this sort of trickery that is designed to entrench the advantage of one particular political persuasion over another. We should all defend democracy and stand up against that sort of rorting. We, in the coalition, are alive to that. We can see in this report the beginnings of these claimed arguments of transparency that are actually about providing a direct benefit to the union movement and the Labor Party over other political participants. We will resist that, tooth and nail.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  by leave—I rise to support the recommendations in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters <span style="font-style:italic;">Conduct of the 2022 federal election and other matters: Interim report</span> and to speak to my additional comments in this report. There is strong appetite for reform around our election process. Australians want to see a level playing field, transparency and truth, not big money affecting the outcomes of elections and policies. Transparency is a great place to start. Australians want to know who's financing candidates before they vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the recommendation of the majority report, which requires real-time disclosure of all donations above $1,000. This is a no-brainer. In my campaign last year I disclosed every cash donation in real time. It's really not that hard. We built a website in a week that can do this. In my additional comments, I make recommendations that go further on transparency. The AEC publishes a so-called transparency register every year, but, even with a lower disclosure threshold, about a third of major party private income is hidden under other receipts. This includes expensive fundraising dinners, membership fees, investment income and who knows what else. This should all be disclosed under clear categories. The lobbyists register should be expanded so everyone can see who the 1,900 unknown in-house lobbyists are. Ministerial diaries should be published so we can see who our decision-makers are listening to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond transparency, Australians are worried that big money has too much influence in politics. The majority report recommends caps on donations and spending. This sounds good, but it may backfire. Voters also want to know that they have a choice, and a bit about the candidates, which requires spending to get the word out. Having run against a major party, I know it's a daunting and expensive challenge. The devil will be in the detail on caps. Structuring caps in a way that's effective and fair will be complicated. I look forward to seeing how the government proposes to respond to the recommendations on caps, and I urge the government to ensure that it does not create another barrier to entry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some types of donations just shouldn't be allowed, and I make additional recommendations in relation to these. Government contractors, including consultants, shouldn't be able to donate. It creates an unhealthy co-dependency, and most OECD countries ban these donations. Companies that inflict social harm, such as gambling and tobacco companies, should also not be able to make political donations. They clearly donate to get a favourable policy outcome, to the detriment of society. As in the UK, companies and unions should have to get shareholder or member approval before making political donations. They should be required to explain to their shareholders or members what benefit they hope to achieve by spending money. I support the majority recommendation establishing a truth-in-political-advertising framework and acknowledge the work of my fellow crossbencher, the member for Warringah, in this area. Politicians should not be able to tell lies in ads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest risk in these recommendations is that any donation reform may further embed the two-party system. In my additional comments, I make further recommendations to level the playing field to ensure that we have competition and renewal in our electoral system. With the largest crossbench ever at the last election, Australians have shown that they want to be represented in different ways. Only 0.4 per cent of Australians are a member of a major political party, but major parties have ways of locking in their advantages. The 99.6 per cent of Australians who are not a member of a major political party may want to be represented by someone other than the 0.4 per cent. Our electoral system cannot lock out these new candidates. In my comments I've identified 13 party advantages and five incumbency advantages. These are a bit boring and technical, but they add up to big barriers to entry. My recommendations try to address some of these advantages, such as banning excessive government ads before elections, equal treatment under privacy and spamming laws, protecting the postal vote process, and creating an independent candidate entity to equalise some of the administrative and tax advantages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the report makes a good start on improving transparency and reducing financial influence, but the devil will be in the detail. I look forward to the government's response. I urge the government, civil society and the public to drive additional reforms to level the playing field to ensure that any donation reforms do not entrench incumbents and reduce competition in our political system.</span>

They voted against their own policy because for them politics is more important than progress. Unlike the previous government, we are making sure that Australia does its bit to look after the environment. We are not slacking behind the rest of the world. But clearly there is a lot of repair to be done. Significant investment is needed in conservation and restoration for a nature-positive future, and the findings of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act review by Professor Graeme Samuel AC make clear that businesses and private sector investment can contribute to reversing environmental decline and help repair and heal nature. We know that some of these private companies, as well as conservation groups, farmers and other landholders, are looking for ways to achieve positive outcomes for nature.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time for this bill to be introduced is now, with an independent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimating that the market for biodiversity in Australia could unlock $137 billion in financial flows by 2050. This is a significant amount of demand, and we are making sure we are well placed to respond to that demand. This isn't about politics either. The nature repair market will be based on science and allow Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders to promote their unique knowledge on their terms. This legislation will encourage investment in nature and drive environmental improvements across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The projects which will be undertaken include activities such as weeding, planting native species and pest control to deliver long-term nature-positive outcomes. These projects can be undertaken on land or water, including lakes and rivers as well as marine and coastal environments. This is also a win for regional Australia and electorates like mine because it will help create jobs and a nature-positive economy as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order for the nature repair market to be effective and make a real difference, it is important that buyers can invest in the market with confidence. To help make sure that this is the case, the bill provides for biodiversity certificates to have integrity and represent an actual environmental improvement. Another key integrity measure is an independent expert committee which is responsible for ensuring projects deliver high-quality nature-positive outcomes underpinned by a constant approach to the measurement, assessment, and verification of biodiversity. There will also be assurance and compliance requirements, which include monitoring, reporting and notification on the delivery of project activities and the progress of environmental outcomes. This will help to ensure the integrity of environmental outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of rebuilding and repairing means restoring public accountability and trust. Transparency will be a core element of the scheme; comprehensive information and project certificates will be available on a public register. Additional information will be regularly published by the regulator, and there will be activity releases of relevant data by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This means parliament and the public will be able to monitor the scheme, providing opportunity for citizen oversight, which will also support certainty and value for the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is committed to doing things differently. We are committed to taking care of our environment and creating a better system to make sure that the environment is properly taken care of. The nature repair market will be an opportunity to create a supply of projects certified through purpose-designed offset methods, and the register will be a comprehensive and public source of information on these projects and the biodiversity that they are protecting. This is a way forward for how Australia repairs the environment. This bill will establish a new market for investing in nature positive outcomes. It will support Australia's international commitments to protect and repair ecosystems and reverse species decline and extinction. It will generate investment and job opportunities for the nature-positive economy and create new income streams for landholders, including Aboriginal peoples, Torres Strait Islanders and farmers. It's a win for the environment, it's a win for landholders and it's a win for jobs. This bill is a win for business and a win for our nation. This bill is a winner for all.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are blessed in this country, and in the Hunter specifically, with our natural environment, and at no time should we stop advancing as a country or as humans, but, as we do so, we have a responsibility to make sure we look after the environment. We need to do this for ourselves, and we must do this for our generations to come. This bill is another step in this journey, and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  Recently our government marked our first anniversary in office. It's an exciting milestone, but it's one where we also reflect on what we've already achieved and the huge amount of work that remains, and this bill really fits into that area. It's an area where, under the previous government, we saw neglect. It's an area that our government is determined to do more in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I'm sure many of us here in this place would agree, we are here to serve our communities and to leave a legacy for future generations; to make the lives of people in our communities better today, better tomorrow and better well into the future. For me, bills like this one are ones where I think about the future of my children, and I know that for many people in my community these are the types of issues they talk to me about: 'I want to know what sort of world I am leaving to my children. I want to know will they be able to see the very special, amazing, unique places, the nature in Australia that I got to see growing up. Will that be there for future generations?' That's really what we're considering here: what kind of world are we leaving for the next generation, and the next and the next?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one of the reasons why I am proud to be part of this government, one that has already, in our year in office, taken great strides on climate action and on protecting the environment, including through the nature repair market, which is a key plank in our government's Nature Positive Plan. And this market is important. In facing the challenges in environmental protection and climate action, everyone—governments, organisations, individuals—must work together. We know that we need significant investment in conservation and restoration for a nature-positive future, and that all of these parts of our communities can contribute to reversing environmental decline. Every single one of us has a role to play in this. And this is where an initiative like the nature repair market can really make a difference. The market will make it easier to invest in projects to protect and repair nature. It does just what it says. It will help in supporting landholders, including farmers and First Nations communities, to do things like plant native species, to repair damaged riverbeds and to remove invasive species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the welcome developments we've seen in Australia in the past few years has been the expansion of interest in driving better environmental outcomes. I know I said there is huge interest in my electorate in this, but I know it's not just in my electorate. I know there are people right around Australia who have a genuine interest in this, who are getting involved in so many different ways. I know there are landholders across Australia who are interested in doing more, in doing their bit as part of this broader effort to conserve and restore nature across our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conservation groups have been doing this important work for decades, but they are now being joined by more farmers and landholders as well as all the community organisations and companies who do want to play their part in this really important effort, in this work that we are doing to protect these places not just for now, but into the future and for the generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the Minister for the Environment and Water released the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment </span>report. It's a five-year report card on the Australian environment. For those who were not following that release closely, I remind the House that this was a report that those opposite didn't want us to see. The member for Farrer, now the deputy Liberal leader, was at the time the minister for the environment. She really didn't want the public to see that report, because she refused to release it. We know why, now that we have seen that report. It is, put simply, a horror of a read. There is example after example of just how much damage a decade of the Liberal and National parties in government did to our environment—once again, one of those key areas just neglected. The damage done under their watch is nothing short of disgraceful. Because of that neglect by those opposite—we've learned through the report—the Australian environment is in very bad shape, and it was heading in the wrong direction. The report found that Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. For the first time, Australia has more foreign plant species than native. Habitat the size of Tasmania has been cleared. Plastics are choking our oceans—up to 80,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometre. And the flow in most Murray-Darling Basin rivers reached record low levels. It is in no way exaggerating to say that these facts paint a dire picture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is no surprise. It is incredibly disappointing, it is distressing, but it is really no surprise that the environment fared so badly under the Liberals and Nationals, in their decade of waste and denial, when you think of what they did. They got rid of any sort of climate laws we had in the country, failed to fix our broken environment laws, laughed about Australia's Pacific island neighbours going under water—we all remember that comment—and failed to land a single one of their 22 different energy policies. They sabotaged the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They promised $40 million for Indigenous water but never delivered a drop. They set recycling targets with no plan to actually deliver them. They voted against the safeguards mechanism, the policy that they previously championed—although that one came after we were in government, but still there is a pattern emerging here, isn't there? They cut highly protected areas of marine parks in half. They cut billions from our environment department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this record of really doing nothing, of in fact actively working to undermine our environment, actively enabling the type of damage that we have seen, has continued. There have been a number of bills before the parliament in the year since the election which have presented a number of opportunities that have been put to those opposite to acknowledge that their approach failed during their decade in office. But it continues to be clear, through their actions in this place and outside, that they have not learned anything. Regardless, our government will continue to do the important and necessary work on repairing nature in this country, on fixing our environment, on protecting the places that are so special and unique to this country and, of course, on addressing climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In one year alone, our government has already taken important steps on our ambitious agenda for the environment and our goal of a nature-positive Australia, protecting more of what's precious, repairing more of what's damaged and managing nature better for the future. Our government is developing stronger laws to better protect nature, to give faster, clearer development decisions—and that's a move that has been welcomed across the board. We are establishing a federal environment protection agency, a tough cop on the beat enforcing the stronger laws. I know there has been a lot of support for that move, in particular, in my community. We are working towards zero new extinctions, backed up by our $225 million investment to protect koalas and other threatened species. We are restoring our urban rivers and waterways. Again, this is one that is close to the heart of my local community. There are three projects in my local community that are benefiting from this work. There is $1.7 million for the Annulus Billabong in Yarra Flats Park, $150,000 for the Friends of Edendale in Eltham North and $500,000 for the Darebin Creek—all important urban waterways in Jagajaga. We know how important it is that we do the work to restore and protect those areas. We're restoring mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses along our coast in Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia, through our Blue Carbon projects. We're cracking down on plastic pollution, doing that work that was neglected for far too long. We've signed up to ambitious global targets and we're giving plastic recycling a $60 million boost. We're doubling the number of Indigenous rangers to help look after country, and that's just a taste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023 add to the work our government is doing in so many areas to repair the environment. Once established, the nature repair market will be a world-leading voluntary market framework to support landholders in protecting and restoring nature. It will include a tradeable biodiversity certificate, assurance and compliance arrangements, a public register, and a nationally consistent approach for measuring biodiversity outcomes. The market will help to mobilise private investment to protect, manage and restore Australia's natural landscape. As I've already said, there are so many people in Australia—corporations and others—who want to be involved in this work. What they've been looking for is the mechanism to allow them to get involved to do their part to help conserve, protect and restore nature, and that is what this will do. It will enable the Clean Energy Regulator to issue Australian landholders with tradeable biodiversity certificates for projects that protect, manage and restore nature. These certificates can then be sold to businesses, organisations, governments and individuals. There are a wide range of provisions to ensure the biodiversity certificates have integrity, so that people can invest with confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All landholders, including First Nations peoples, conservation groups and farmers can participate in the market. Landholders can undertake projects that improve or protect existing habitat as well as projects to establish or restore habitat. These projects can be on land, in inland waterways, lakes or rivers, or in marine and coastal environments. Some examples of the type of work that might be undertaken through this are: improving or restoring existing native vegetation through fencing or weeding; planting a mix of local species in a previously cleared area; and protecting rare grasslands that provide habitat for endangered species. The bill includes provisions to ensure that nature projects are based on the best available science, because on this side of the House we listen to the science. We know that being guided by the science is the way to protect our environment, to tackle climate change, and to ensure a sustainable future not just for us but also for our children and their children, the work that good governments should do in this place. The provisions that ensure that include: an independent expert nature repair market committee; methodology determinations that set out the requirements for different types of projects, meet legislative biodiversity integrity standards and are endorsed by the repair nature market committee; a consistent way of measuring improvements in biodiversity, set out in an overarching biodiversity assessment instrument; requirements for biodiversity projects to be undertaken in line with the methodology determinations; tradeable biodiversity certificates that are regulated to ensure they provide accurate information about projects; and a public register of projects and certificates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is making it easier for people to invest in the activities that help repair nature. We are incredibly fortunate in this country to live on a continent that includes such special, magical places. These are the places that are our heritage. They are the places that our First Nations people are offering to share with us—offering through the work that's happening in this place today on the Voice—for us all to protect and look after as part of our history and ongoing future. When we have those places here, it behoves all of us to do everything we can to protect them and to make sure that we do the work now that means they will be there for future generations. That's why this bill and the work our government has been doing more broadly to protect the environment and tackle climate change in this country are so important. It is why I am so proud to be a member of the Albanese Labor government. It is why members of my community come to me and say: 'It is so important you do this work. I want you to do this work now for us, for our children. This country is worth protecting.' We know we have to do the work now to make sure the environment is protected into the future. We do want to leave the environment across our country better off because that is better for all of us—it is better for those of us here today and it is better for our kids and our grandkids. We do want to work with communities right across the country to do this work. This bill will support landholders, farmers and First Nations communities to do those things that many of them are already doing off their own bat. This will provide the mechanism and the market to do the work and to have more people get involved, things like planting native species, repairing damaged riverbeds and removing invasive species. Beyond those just doing the work, we are making it easier for others in Australia to invest in that work. We are creating a market that will allow for people who do want to support this work to see how they can be involved through the market, a market that is, as I said, based on science and based on what is best for the environment. We are setting this up so that it is not only a scheme that works for the short-term or in special interests—in fact not for special interests—but also a scheme that is set up to protect our environment into the future and allow all of us to be part of making sure that our country's environment is protected and that we do the work that's necessary.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I'm very grateful to be given the opportunity to speak today on this very important legislation. The Nature Repair Market Bill will make it easier for all people in Australia to invest in the production and repair of our natural environment, including businesses, organisations, non-government organisations, individuals and companies. Each have a pivotal role in helping repair our natural environment, in preventing climate change and protecting the future environment for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a very special interest in this in my electorate of Macarthur. My koala population is the last surviving urban koala colony that is chlamydia free. My electorate of Macarthur is at the apex of the Sydney environment, if we see the Sydney Basin as a triangle that spreads towards Macarthur, the south-west. We have vital environmental features in my electorate, including the bases of the two major rivers of the Sydney Basin, the Georges River and the Nepean River. We are, really, the last area of the Sydney Basin that is available to for housing development, and we've seen development applications for massive developments happening to my electorate and just to the south-west, including the townships of Picton, Wilton, Appin and Maldon, where there is already massive development happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shamefully in the last 20 or 30 years, there's been haphazard development in the Sydney Basin. There have been extinctions and loss of environment, and the last remnants of the Cumberland Plain woodland is gradually disappearing. That's been under the watch of successive government, not always coalition governments but some Labor governments shamefully, and I think we all have to have responsibility for this. At last, federally, we have the government that is honest about our environment, that is transparent about what we want to do and that is very active now in trying to protect our environmental future for the generations that will follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm now grandparent, and I want my grandchildren to grow up in an environment where they can see the natural habitat, the flora and the fauna, the same as I did. Our opportunity to do that is disappearing fast. In Macarthur, we have schools where kids can look out the windows of their classrooms and see koalas in the trees around them, and I think that is something that is worthy of protecting beyond measure. Yet we have developers and we have politicians who are willing to see that destroyed. In the last 10 years of Liberal-National government in New South Wales, we've had complete in action on the environment—both at a state political level and at a federal level. I invited all the state environment ministers since I was elected in 2016, all the federal environment ministers since I was elected in 2016—the coalition environment ministers—to come to Macarthur and see what was happening, including the last coalition Treasurer, who was also an environment minister, the former member for Kooyong—to come out and have a look. The only person who did was Matt Kean, the then New South Wales environment minister. He made a lot of promises. None were fulfilled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It almost brought me to tears watching the Cumberland woodland being destroyed every time I would go out to Appin and watch the Appin development. I saw these koala habitat trees being bulldozed into the ground—absolutely tragic. I begged the environment ministers—I begged Gabrielle Upton when she was the New South Wales environment minister, I begged Melissa Price when she was the federal minister and I begged Matt Kean when he was the state environment minister—to do something to stop this environmental destruction. Nothing was done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's winter now, and our koalas are mostly pretty sedentary at this time, but pretty soon it will be spring. We'll watch those koalas cross Appin Road and get killed. We'll watch our wombats, our wallaroos and our lace monitors—the big goanna like lizards—cross the road and be killed. Nothing has been done. There have been promises made and nothing has been done—until the advent of a federal Labor government. Finally, we're getting things done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is a commitment by the environment minister, the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek, to environmental protection. It's imperative that we follow the findings of the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment </span>report, which found that our environment is in very bad shape and was not static but getting worse. The report found that Australia had lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent, that plastics are choking our oceans and that this all occurred under the watch of the previous coalition government as things were rapidly getting worse, as our population ramped up and as our climate deteriorated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past year there have been over 500 new species discovered in Australia and named by scientists. This equates to two new species every day. I think that's remarkable. I thank our dedicated scientists for the work they do in making us aware of our flora and fauna and how they must be protected. At this stage I'd like to pay credit to Professor Robert Close, a scientist from Western Sydney University, who did the first koala study of south-western Sydney and found the large numbers of koalas that we have with disease-free status, and their mobility across the Georges and Nepean river areas. He also documented many that had died in road traffic accidents et cetera.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to protecting our local species and to putting in place laws that will encourage people to do this. With my colleague the member for Hughes, I have set up the parliamentary friends of endangered species group. I think it's important that all of us as politicians, as lawmakers, realise the urgency of the crisis facing our environment—and we must act now. It is getting too late to change things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm always very interested in new ways and means to protect our environment. We depend on our scientists to tell us about this. In Macarthur, in our peri-urban environment, we have the potential to allow our children and grandchildren to maintain the ability to see koalas from their classrooms, to see kangaroos and wallabies in our woodlands, to see the beautiful lace monitors—the big lizards—but also things like our snakes and our other reptiles, and our birds. We have black cockatoos and all sorts of bird life in our environment. I want our kids to be able to continue to see that. I was dismayed by the lack of action from previous governments, state and federal, to realise the urgency of protecting our national environment and our flora and fauna. Sadly, those on the other side really never understood the importance of it and never understood the important biodiversity that is present in our urban and peri-urban areas that require protection. Good government means transparency and it means action, and this is what the Albanese government is doing with this legislation. I also thank the New South Wales Labor government for being committed to the same policies. We depend also on our non-government organisations such as the Total Environment Centre and the Nature Conservation Council, which have helped us find ways of preserving our environment for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings us all together. It brings together politicians, farmers, private companies, conservation groups, scientists, universities and individuals to protect our environment. The biodiversity offsets that will help us protect our environment are a more than $120 billion market. This is something we will now set in stone in legislation for the future, and this legislation will help with that. Transparency of course is a core of this policy, and it is very important that we allow people to see what is happening in our environment around the country. I speak mainly about Macarthur, but I have been all over this country and have seen the magnificent diversity of environments that we have, from Tasmania, to Western Australia, to Kakadu, to the Great Barrier Reef—</span>

                    </a>  The Great Ocean Road in Victoria has been mentioned! It is a magnificent environment that I have been to and seen. This bill will help preserve those environments for the future generations. We often take our grandchildren down to the South Coast to look at some of the unbelievable environments around Jervis Bay and further south, and I want them to be able to continue to see the biodiversity in those areas. It is so important for their future that we do this. This bill will support certainty and value for the market, and it shows our commitment to restoring accountability and public trust, which our Nature Positive Plan preserves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, we're committed to working with all government and non-government agencies to ensure that the certificates issued in the nature repair market are not the products of greenwashing, to ensure that they really mean what they say and to ensure there is transparency about what they do. Tanya Plibersek, the environment minister, is determined to do that. It's imperative that these certificates accurately reflect the projects and investment that they represent and that the projects in the carbon and biodiversity markets are not affected by misleading claims, and transparency is important in that. These are all very, very important steps, and I am very proud to be part of a government that takes nature protection and preservation seriously. We are already committed to protecting 30 per cent of our land and seas by 2030. We have set a goal of zero new extinctions, with a more than $200 million investment in protecting threatened species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, this bill will establish a new market for investing in nature-positive outcomes and environment-positive outcomes. It will support Australia's international commitments to protect and repair ecosystems and reverse species decline and extinction. I am very fond of our local species, particularly our koalas. I have encouraged a proposal to make a Twin Rivers national park in the Macarthur area, connecting up the Georges and Nepean rivers in a koala protection area, that will connect up with the Dharug National Park, which has very important Indigenous heritage and Indigenous artefacts in the park. I really would like that to be preserved as a further extension of our local national parks. All of this will happen only with commitment from all forms of government, local, state and federal. I am very proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government that is supporting this environmental plan for our future, our children’s future and the generations that follow in the future. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  Like the member for Macarthur, I have a peri-urban electorate. I'm not sure my koalas are quite as famous as the member for Macarthur's koalas, but we do see the odd koala at the Langwarrin Flora and Fauna Reserve. I have seen both a tiger snake and a tawny frogmouth in my own backyard, and needless to say there was one of those I was happy to see! Like in many electorates, whether they be urban, peri-urban, regional or rural, the people in my electorate care deeply about both the local environment and, more broadly, Australia's environment and what we have always been incredibly proud of: our native flora and fauna. I was trying to think of a way to describe how integral to the sense of being Australian our flora and fauna is. I came up with the suggestion that Crocodile Dundee wasn't necessarily popular for the acting so much as—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms MURPHY:</span>
                    </a>  Not everyone in the chamber agrees with that statement, but I will carry on! It was not so much for the acting as it was for a depiction of an Australia that Australians, no matter where they live in the country, no matter how long they've been here—whether they were born here or came here—inherently think of as Australia. It is the outback, the native animals—a slightly outdated, sexist man, but apart from that! The environment somehow is just a part of all of us. As I said, people in my electorate care about that and identify with the Australian environment, as do people across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are just two small examples of what locals are doing in Dunkley because they care about the environment. Of course, those who have the longest connection to the environment—and it's about culture as much as it is about where they live—are out First Nations people. Ben was kind enough to talk to me about a program operating in my community and the surrounding region called the Warreen Beek rangers course. Warreen Beek means 'saltwater people' in the local language. It's a training program for Indigenous rangers developed with the Bunurong and Wiradjuri land councils in collaboration with a lot of other groups, including Holmesglen TAFE and Trust for Nature. The course was developed as there was a lack of trained people to work as land management practitioners. It was consultation with community members that led to the idea of starting a course. We are not only tapping in to First Nations connection with the land but also giving people qualifications that allow them to use that connection as part of a career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rangers in the program are learning to care for country. It is a course that's designed specifically with and for traditional owners, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, to learn the skills to work on country, providing accredited training in areas such as pest plant control, revegetation, construction, chainsaw use, occupational health and safety, and cultural studies. It's a hands-on approach that provides a culturally safe space for people to learn together and is actively improving the local environment. Students in the course have worked in coastal areas and on properties that have conservation covenants, providing landholders with a chance to understand traditional knowledge. Students learn land-care skills such as plant identification and threatened species conservation techniques. This is the sort of program that this Albanese government wants to invest in and support. It's a concrete example of commitment to environment being delivered by local communities with and for First Nations people, something that I think is a tangible example, of course, of what the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice will accomplish if we get the referendum through later this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second example of my community's commitment to the environment and sustainability that I wanted to tell the chamber about is the Frankston High School Eco Team. I've had a lot to do with in the different students that have come through in the four years I've been in this place and the few years before I was elected. They are always, always looking for ways to improve the environment around their school and the sustainability of not just their school but the broader community, in the knowledge that climate change and threats to biodiversity are the existential threats to their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These exceptional young people recently came and spoke to Paul Edbrooke, the member for Frankston, and me about the need for better environmental education in schools, embedding education about sustainability across all courses so you're not just learning about it if you are studying geography; it's part of science and English and home tech and all of the subjects that everyone does. Everyone can learn about environment and sustainability, how the subjects impact those concepts and also how those concepts can enhance the subject. Then they had an incredibly detailed and impressive submission about the policies of the education department on protecting the environment and sustainability, showing how they were vague and lacked enforcement. As their school is going through renovation because of investment, they asked why the state government didn't have stricter standards on sustainability and protection of the environment when building public school facilities. I don't think you could get smarter or more involved young people than the Frankston High School economics team, who are actively taking a role in looking after the environment, for their future but also for the people that come after them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we now have a government that is committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's lands and seas by 2030. These are the goals that were adopted globally under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, and they're the goals that this piece of legislation is looking to help us reach. The goals reinforce the findings of the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the environment </span>report in Australia, which was an incredibly disturbing report with a story of environmental degradation, loss and inaction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How could it be the case, in a country where the environment, the flora and fauna, are deeply embedded in our national psyche, that we could have lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent? How could it be the case that Australia, a country where we almost venerate the wattle, the banksia and all of our local plant species, now has more foreign plant species than native species in the country? How could it be the case? In just short of two decades—in this century alone—habitat the size of Tasmania has been cleared. We know that plastics are choking our oceans with about 80,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometre. I'm not even making a political point. It's really just the point that this is where we're at in this country. We can't be a country that sees ourselves as unique in the world because of our landscapes, our waterways and our animals yet does nothing to protect them or doesn't do enough to protect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's why I'm really pleased about this government's Nature Positive Plan and the establishment of the nature repair market. If anybody embodies the saying 'hit the ground running', it has to be the Minister for the Environment and Water, who hasn't wasted a minute getting on with the job of saying: 'What legislative measures do we need? What oversight measures do we need? What role can we play in the international community to not just protect what we have left but try to restore some of what we've lost?' That's what's really important. This nature repair market doesn't just protect what we've got; it also helps us restore what we've lost, harnessing business and private sector investment, working so that landholders, farmers and First Nations communities can play their roles in planting native species, repairing damaged riverbeds and removing invasive species. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the speakers before me have talked about what this legislation does, so there's nothing new or revelatory in what I'm saying about it, but the structure of this scheme is really important. It's fundamentally important that the clean energy regulator is going to have that regulatory role. It's fundamentally important that there is going to be transparency and integrity in the scheme. We have to make sure that there's not greenwashing. It just boggles my mind, really, that corporations would like to pretend that they're doing something for the environment but not actually do it. If you know that you need to pretend, then you know that there is a moral imperative. You know it matters to people but you still don't care enough to actually do it. That's why it is really important that the ACCC and ASIC will have a role in ensuring certificates under this market aren't really greenwashing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that wants to do things differently. I am proud of a government that wants to act swiftly. I invite members of the opposition to be part of that. We do stand here and make partisan remarks. We have talked about the 10 years under those opposite, which we see as marked with wasted opportunities and neglect, but maybe let's put that behind us for this and say, 'Let's move forward.' Let's have some bipartisanship about moving forward about something that, when it comes down to it, surely we all care about. We all care about protecting Australia's unique environment. Surely we can't have an argument about encouraging biodiversity and all it represents. I'd be surprised if there was an argument about using a market system to do so. I would have thought those on the other side would have been right up for that sort of mechanism. Let's put the cudgels down for once.</span>

Here's this legislation; here's an opportunity to start being part of a cooperative approach to protect what matters the most, which is somewhere healthy, safe and beautiful for us all to live in and for our grandchildren and children to live in. If we don't have that, the rest of it isn't going to matter very much. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. Like many in this place, I want to make sure that Australia's next generation inherits a better Australia than the one that my generation inherited. This includes natural environment and the custodianship of it. Given the challenges that we now face with the change in climate, the task of remediation, repairing and rebuilding our natural environment has only become more challenging. These global forces mean that we shouldn't give up, that we need to become more innovative, more adaptive and more committed to task. That is what this bill before us seeks to do. It would introduce a world-leading voluntary market framework to support landholders in protecting and restoring nature. It establishes our tradeable biodiversity certificate, assurance and compliance arrangements, a public register and a nationally consistent approach for measuring biodiversity outcomes. This will mobilise private investment to protect, manage and restore Australia's natural landscape. In other words, this market will make it easier for businesses, organisations, government and individuals to invest in projects to protect and repair nature. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing the market in legislation will ensure its ongoing integrity. It will encourage investment in nature and drive environmental improvements across Australia. If anything from the past decade of coalition government has shown us, it is that to attract investment you need to provide certainty, transparency and integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To achieve this the bill establishes an independent nature repair market committee to advise the minister on scheme integrity. Methodology determinations that set out the requirements for different types of projects must meet legislated biodiversity integrity standards and be endorsed the Nature Repair Market Committee. It also includes a consistent way of measuring improvements in biodiversity set out in an overarching biodiversity assessment instrument. It requires biodiversity projects to be undertaken in line with a methodology determination, tradeable biodiversity certificates that are regulated to ensure they provide accurate information about projects, a public register of projects and certificates and an assurance and compliance framework to maintain integrity in the market and provide confidence that projects are being delivered as expected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market will be based on science and enable Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders to promote their unique knowledge on their terms. Many speakers before me have outlined the unique role that First Nations people will have in participating in this market and the clear crossover it has with the Indigenous ranger program and the work rangers undertake in weed management, controlling feral animals, fire management, saving species and ensuring the health of our waterways and seas. We have many community members active in the program, including my friend Rusty Abbott, who is a passionate trainer of First Nations rangers in our region. Rusty recently explained that on the South Coast of New South Wales in the member for Gilmore's electorate there are now six rangers working in Batemans Bay and a further five in the Wallaga Lake area. There are also set to be more rangers in the years ahead, with programs set up in the New South Wales corrections system to support prisoners to retrain and have the skills and qualifications to become rangers when released and ready to re-enter the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government understands the important role that our First Nations Australians play in bringing 65,000 years of knowledge into present-day action. That is why as a government we are doubling the number of Indigenous rangers by the end of the decade. We have declared new Indigenous protected areas and are increasing funding for the management of Indigenous protected areas. We have also nominated the Murujuga cultural landscape in WA for World Heritage listing, incorporating 65,000 years of First Nations conservation into action today—nature-positive heritage protection. We are delivering the $40 million of Indigenous water in the Murray-Darling Basin which was promised by the previous government but never delivered. We have signed a partnership with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance to work together to write new cultural heritage protection legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will establish a new market for investing in nature-positive outcomes. It will support Australia's international commitments to protect and repair ecosystems and reverse species decline and extinction. It will generate investment and job opportunities for a nature-positive economy and create new income streams for landholders, including Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander farmers. More importantly this bill we see before the House today is part of the Albanese Labor government delivering on its Nature Positive Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 is but one of a suite of policies to protect, repair and rebuild our environment. The Australian government has committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030. The same goals have been adopted globally under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. These goals reinforce the findings of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia state of the environment 2021</span> report and its story of environmental degradation, loss and inaction—a report which the former minister, now deputy opposition leader, hid from the Australian people, refusing to release it, and we now know why.

We're investing $10.8 million to improve ocean and marine park management, and we are expanding blue carbon projects to restore mangroves, seagrasses and reef habitats for breeding and feeding. We're making Australia an environmental leader once again by signing the Leaders' Pledge for Nature, joining the international Mangrove Alliance for Climate, signing the joint declaration on the creation of a global coalition for blue carbon, joining the Forests and Climate Leaders' Partnership, joining the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution, with a view to ending plastic pollution by 2040, and leading in making sure that the UN high seas treaty is signed.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and related bill. It is an exciting time to be an environmentalist in this country. It's an exciting time to be an environmentalist under this Albanese Labor government. It's always interesting to reflect on history when we're looking at big reforms moving forward. Of course, this will be the first step in introducing a market based mechanism to recognise biodiversity and to generate the tradeable certificates required to support that market moving forward. It reminds me of a period under the last Labor government, when we set about doing the same thing with carbon certificates. I'll come back to that shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As many people in here know, my first love is environmental science. I studied environmental science here in Canberra at the ANU and focused on forestry and forest science during my period there. The issue of sustainability has been at the core of my interest across a whole range of areas ever since, and the conversation that we were always having in that space was about the triple-bottom-line benefits of any particular activity and, indeed, any particular regulatory policy intervention. The triple bottom line is about getting positive net outcomes at an environmental level, a social level and an economic level. And that is the theoretical framework, the best-practice framework, that we pursue in terms of sustainable environmental management. Of course, true environmentalism has to be pragmatic. It has to be progressive—you have to be able to make progress on it—and a critical component of the sustainability of any environmental regulatory framework is the economic component of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about the economics of environmental management, I think of it very broadly, but one of the key areas I always come back to is jobs. Jobs—good, well-paid, sustainable jobs—are at the core of any sustainable environmental effort, and in order to create and sustain those jobs there does need to be an economic return from particular activities. This legislation provides the steps required to start to establish the necessary market to create the economic return that will ultimately create more jobs in the environmental sector and deliver a greater level of sustainability accordingly. We all understand the importance of biodiversity in any particular ecosystem, and the nature of ecosystems and environments is that they are evolving; they are changing. There is no static environmental state, and, accordingly, we have to understand our own human influence on the environment around us. Through aggressive environmental interventions, industrial development and then also some downstream effects of other human activity we do have an impact on biodiversity, in all the places and spaces, be it through the expansion of our cities and communities into new land and new areas or, perhaps, from pollutions and other contaminations of airways and waterways that do flow on and have those downstream effects. We understand that everything we do has an impact on the environment around us. Unfortunately, if that's not well managed, if that's not consciously considered, we can have a negative impact on biodiversity. But that does not necessarily have to be the case. Indeed, there are a whole range of industrial activities, a whole range of employment-generating business and other social activities that can happen in our environmental systems and can, in fact, aid and further enhance the environmental credentials of those systems. Sometimes it's about repair and sometimes it's about organic enhancement along the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly like to think of one of my beloved sectors: the forestry sector. It is a sector that is an employer all across our country, with many thousands of jobs in every state and territory. The native forest sector here in Australia has the potential to be one of the great sustainable industries, one of the great sustainable employers. There's no doubt that the industry itself has faced challenges over time and has not always found itself either capable or willing to conform with the regulatory frameworks that are in place that to protect the environmental credibility of the spaces they operate in, often despite the best of intentions of those that are there. To some extent, that has been exacerbated by the unnecessary expectation—perhaps unreasonable at times—that the costs associated with that environmental maintenance, repair and enhancement will be borne by the existing commercial operations when in actual fact those environmental interventions are externalities of the standard commercial operation in that space and, indeed, what we need to do is generate a mechanism for the economic return on those investments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what this bill does. This bill recognises biodiversity as an asset for our community, an asset for our society and, indeed, an asset now for our economy. It now creates the conditions for investment in environmental biodiversity. Those businesses or community groups that go about improving biodiversity in their local environment can now generate an economic return to fund that activity, to fund those improvements. That's a really critical component here. This is something, as I said earlier, that was attempted to be done, similarly, with carbon crediting. I was very fortunate to work on some carbon modelling projects in the lead-up to the Copenhagen climate change conference around the time that the former Labor government was bringing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation into this place. It's again a pertinent time to be thinking about the politics around that particular issue, particularly as we see the Liberal Party and the Greens teaming up once again in the Senate to knock off a very important piece of progressive legislation. That's, of course, what happened in regard to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a model with great similarity to the concept of a market-based mechanism for biodiversity improvement. What we have seen is the recent review of Carbon crediting, led by Professor Ian Chubb, with a look back at that period of dysfunction that was caused by the Greens party teaming up with the Liberal Party to essentially deny the Australian economy, Australian society and the Australian environment the opportunity to have a market-based mechanism for recognising carbon sequestration and carbon abatement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the cost of that was a flailing decade under the conservative government, under the Liberals opposite, whereby they couldn't land an environment or energy policy. The consequence of that for our economy was that big employers, particularly those that had significant emissions profiles, were unable to act with confidence. As they didn't know the future of the regulatory environment in which they were operating, they were unable to act with security. Ultimately, the impact of that was they weren't able to invest in their own carbon abatement. Even though they wanted to reduce their emissions, they weren't able to make the necessary investments to do it because the investment environment was so deeply compromised by the Greens party and the Liberal Party teaming up in the Senate to prevent a world-leading market based mechanism. The irony of those so-called economic liberals opposite working with the Greens to stand in the way of a market based mechanism to deal with the environmental challenges of that particular time is not lost on us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to the review of carbon credit units that Professor Ian Chubb recently completed, we took the lessons of the former government's dysfunction, and they are enshrined in this piece of work. We now have a proposal before us for a market based mechanism for biodiversity recognition. It's a system that has integrity and a framework that is structured, considered and, importantly, scientifically informed about what biodiversity is. What the improvements look like is a system for measuring those improvements and, importantly, attributing an economic value to those improvements in the form of the tradeable certificates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole range of organisations, businesses, community groups, philanthropists and others across our economy who are passionate about protecting biodiversity, who want to see a market based mechanism that they can have confidence in, that has integrity, that they can begin trading with a view to supporting the economic framework that leads to the environmental and social outcomes that biodiversity brings. We're so very lucky to see some of those businesses, some of those community groups, leading the way in that space, and that has informed a lot of the work that has gone into this. We know the demand is there. We know the Australian community wants to see sustainable biodiversity improvements. We know that must have an economic underpinning. And we now, finally, have the mechanism, delivered through this bill, delivered through those tradeable certificates, for that economic underpinning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole bunch of different activities that those groups can undertake, and they are, importantly, scientifically informed. Weeding, planting native species, pest control: these are examples of the types of activities that can improve or lead to improvements in biodiversity outcomes, and we can see that happening in ecosystems that are varied and variable all across our wide, brown land—that's not always brown. We've seen that in our forests; we see it in our riparian ecosystems along our rivers and our waterways; we see it in our agricultural zones, which are ripe for improved biodiversity, particularly with improved forward thinking. Farmers, particularly new generations of farming families coming through, can see the opportunity within their own established wildlife corridors. They can see it in their windbreaks. They can see the opportunity for improved biodiversity, particularly as those farmers are now generating greater efficiencies from the arable land that they do have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other parts of the ecosystem that can be protected on an ongoing basis. We see that with the reduction in land-clearing activities that occur. And again, these are all opportunities to generate biodiversity certificates—something that we've never had a mechanism for delivering an economic return on previously. Once again, we see this legislation as the enabling piece for facilitating the demand of the community to improve biodiversity while making sure it is done so sustainably and with an economic underpinning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market will enable, indeed, it will encourage First Nations and traditional owners to further involve themselves in these activities, with leaders in this space to be drivers of the interventions required in accordance, as I said, with science and with traditional knowledge. Bringing those things together will ultimately mean that we create more jobs across our country and more jobs for Aboriginal and First Nations people, who bring a particular level of expertise and passion to this pursuit. We know that they will be sustainable, well-paid jobs because of the economic underpinnings that this legislation delivers. We know that the ability to trade certificates to generate a scientifically informed biodiversity return that has an economic attachment to it means that those jobs will be sustainable into the future. We can enjoy both the biodiversity outcomes and the employment outcomes. This legislation brings together the triple-bottom-line outcomes we have been seeking for so long. It lines up the environmental interest with the social and economic interests. I commend the legislation to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Buchholz, and thank you as well for filling in for me while I give this speech. I also rise to support this Nature Repair Market Bill. It is a very important piece of legislation. We just heard the member for Hawke outline many of the intricate details in his clear, precise speech about what this Nature Repair Market Bill will be doing. It is very important to restore nature to its natural habitat, while ensuring at the same time we give the opportunity to local community groups, farmers, Indigenous groups to restore their part of the world back to nature. That is what this bill is all about. It is about making it easier for people to invest in those types of activities that help repair nature, because we all have a duty to leave nature better for our children and our grandchildren. I have said many, many times here that we have an absolute duty in this place to ensure that we hand over a better world to the next generation, not just on the side of economics and everything else, which are very important, but also nature so this earth can survive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about supporting landholders, as I said, including farmers, who are doing a lot of good work around the country. This will enhance that good work. It will also support First Nations communities to do things like plant native species to repair the damage done in riverbeds or to remove invasive species. We are also making it easier for businesses and philanthropists to invest in these efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that last year the Minister for the Environment and Water released the official five-yearly report card on the Australian environment, which was called the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the Environment Report</span>. We know there were a lot of issues in that report. It was like going through a catalogue of horrors showing how much damage has been done to our environment through neglect. The report says that the Australian environment is in very bad shape and getting worse. Reading the report, some of the statistics you'll be shocked to hear. It found Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent in the world. For the first time Australia has more foreign plants than native species. Habitat the size of Tasmania has been cleared between 2000 and 2017, and we hear plastics are absolutely choking our oceans, with up to 80,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometre. It is pretty horrendous when you stop and think about these statistics. And, of course, we have all seen over the last 10 to 20 years flows in most Murray-Darling rivers have reached record low levels. It's no wonder that our environment has fared pretty badly in the last decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is making it easier, as I said, even in my electorate, with the River Torrens, which flows right through the middle of my electorate. It starts up in the Adelaide Hills and runs out to the outlet at Henley Beach in the electorate of Hindmarsh. This was a natural river that came from the Adelaide Hills, flowed through the Adelaide Plains and out into the ocean. Before we settled here, before we urbanised most of that area that I'm talking about, the natural landscape played its part in nature. For example, most of the western suburbs, towards the beachside, were full of reed beds. The reed beds slowed the flow and filtered the water before it went out into the ocean. We've urbanised that entire area. We've cemented canals et cetera. All the pollution run-off into the River Torrens flows out into the Gulf of St Vincent, to Adelaide's beaches, destroying seagrass, destroying the environment in the sea. A Senate report came out in the year 2000, if I recall correctly, with many recommendations to restore the outlet into the Gulf of St Vincent in South Australia to ensure that we protected our fishing industry and the environment. The fishing industry in South Australia is huge, especially in the Gulf of St Vincent—everything from prawns to snapper to squid. You name it. I'm pleased to say that some of those recommendations were taken up, but this will be another opportunity for us in my electorate and in the state of South Australia to see how we can restore some of those flows back into a natural environment. I know a lot of good work is being done. We've seen parts of the River Torrens restored already. This will give the opportunity to smaller environmental groups, conservation groups, neighbourhoods, to jump on board and assist in restoring some of those reed beds back to their natural state so they can play a part in filtration of some of the pollution before it goes out into the sea, ensuring that we have a healthy Gulf of St Vincent so we can continue with our fishing industry and our recreation industry and, of course, maintain our natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this legislation, the Albanese Labor government is delivering on its Nature Positive Plan, with the establishment of the nature repair market. This market will make it easier for businesses, organisations and individuals to invest in projects in their local area to protect and repair nature. As I said, an example is the River Torrens in my electorate. The government is committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030. The same goals have been adopted globally under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. These goals reinforce the findings of the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment </span>report and its story of environmental degradation. I pointed out earlier that we've lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent in the world, and, for the first time, Australia has more foreign plant species than native species, which is pretty shocking. This will assist with some of that. We need significant investment in conservation and restoration for a nature-positive future, so we can hand over a better environment to the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Business and private sector investment can contribute to reversing environmental decline. This was highlighted in the findings of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act review by Professor Graeme Samuel AC. Private companies, conservation groups, farmers and other landholders are increasingly looking for ways to achieve positive outcomes for nature. I already hear some tremendous stories of work that farmers are doing in restoring some of their landholdings back to nature and of course the great work that conservation groups do in all of our electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent report prepared independently by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that the market for biodiversity in Australia could unlock $137 billion in financial flows by 2050, and we're responding to that demand. The nature repair market will be based on science and enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to promote their unique knowledge—and we know that they have unique knowledge—on their terms. Establishing the market in legislation will ensure its ongoing integrity, encourage investment in nature and drive environmental improvements across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will enable the Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority with significant experience in regulating environmental markets, to issue Australian landholders with tradeable biodiversity certificates. The certificates can be then sold to businesses, organisations, governments and individuals, and all landholders including Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, conservation groups and farmers can participate in the market. Projects will deliver long-term nature-positive outcomes through activities such as weeding, planting native species and pest control, and they can be undertaken on land or water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I go back to the Gulf St Vincent in my part of the world where seagrass is being planted just offshore, which then generates breeding spots for the fishing industry. We know that's where sea species—fish and squid and everything else—do their breeding and feeding, where there's seagrass. So it's very important. They've been restoring that part of the world for a number of years now, and I hope this will encourage more restoration in the Gulf St Vincent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market will enable, as I said, all that participation and utilise First Nations people to use their skills and knowledge for a nature-positive future. The market will also operate in parallel with the carbon market, facilitated by having the same regulator. This is important because the alignment will encourage carbon farming projects that will also deliver benefits for biodiversity. There will be administrative efficiencies in this approach and, more importantly, clear and accurate oversight of claims made in both markets. Our government acknowledges the recent review of carbon crediting led by Professor Ian Chubb. Lessons learnt from the carbon market have informed the bill and will continue to be reflected upon as the environmental markets develop. It will also provide for biodiversity certificates to have integrity and represent an actual environmental improvement. Buyers can then invest in the market with confidence knowing that it does have some outcome in the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key integrity measure is an independent expert committee that will be responsible for ensuring projects deliver high-quality nature-positive outcomes underpinned by a consistent approach to the measurement, assessment and verification of biodiversity. The integrity of environmental outcomes is also enabled through assurance and compliance requirements that will be part of this bill. This includes the monitoring, reporting and notification of the delivery of project activities and progress on the environmental outcome. The regulator will have monitoring and enforcement powers to ensure that projects are conducted in accordance with the rules, and that's very important.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency will be a core element to the scheme. Comprehensive information about projects, how they're travelling and their certificates will be available on a public register for all to see. Additional information will be regularly published by the regulator, and there will be active release of relevant data by that Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This will enable the parliament and the public to monitor the scheme and provide an opportunity for citizen oversight, and it will support certainly and value to the market.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department is committed to working with the ACCC and ASIC to ensure that certificates issued in the nature repair market are not victims of greenwashing claims. We have seen some reports of greenwashing, and we've also seen ASIC looking into some of these greenwashing claims that are currently happening at the moment; we don't want to see that creeping in. That the statements made about the certificates accuracy must reflect the projects and investment they represent and that projects in the carbon and biodiversity markets are not affected by misleading claims. There has to be confidence in this system and this scheme, and this is one way of doing it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that our environment has been deteriorating rapidly. There was a report that was received after the report showing that one of the foundational elements of this was an offset system that lacked integrity. We need to have that integrity, and I know that ASIC will be oversighting this, ensuring that greenwashing doesn't happen and that companies or people getting these credits are not just getting them without actual improvement in the environment. I commend this bill to the House. It's very important. I assure you that I will be supporting it, and I hope everyone else will also be supporting it, because it is our absolute obligation to the next generation of Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  I am so grateful to be in the chamber to hear the member for Hindmarsh's contribution, because, like him, I see this bill as a necessary step for us all to support in order to make sure that we are leaving this continent a better place for future generations. During the election campaign, many people asked me why I decided to put my hand up to run. I said that, first and foremost, it was because I wanted to make sure that we saw action on climate change. That is what drove me to stand and put my hand up to be the candidate for Reid, and it is what drove me each and every day of that campaign.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think about what we are doing when it comes to the environment, how we are acting on climate, and what we are doing for future generations, and to that end I think about my son and the world that he will inherit. When I explained to him what this role was and why mummy was running to be a member of the federal parliament, I told him that I wanted to make sure that we were looking out of the environment. He had a couple of specific requests for me, should I become a federal member of parliament—he wanted me to plant more trees and protect our environment. I was very grateful to Strathfield Council, because on National Tree Day I was able to plant some trees in our local park along with my son. I was also able to fulfil a commitment to my husband recently when we went to the Great Barrier Reef. That was something he had been wanting to do for a number of years, and we finally got around to doing it. We were able to show my son the incredible diversity of marine life that is in the Great Barrier Reef, something that we are very lucky to have in this country. I've been able to fulfil two important commitments to my son and my husband when it comes to the environment in Australia. What I haven't been able to do is celebrate my son's birthday with him tomorrow. I wish him a very happy birthday for tomorrow. Hopefully, he will understand that mummy is in this place trying to ensure that we do everything we can to protect the environment so that we are able to grant his wishes that we protect the environment, that we plant more trees and that we look after the animals in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw the beauty of the Australian environment at the Great Barrier Reef, but I also saw the fragility of it when we went down to the south coast after the bushfires had torn through that place. There is so much for us to do to make sure that we are protecting our environment when it comes to things like this bill, acting on climate change and making sure that we take seriously the threats to our national environment that come when we do have climate change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this bill being introduced to this House is incredibly important. It's very personal to me. It's the reason I put my hand up to stand for this seat and it's what I am driven to do every day in this place. When it comes to the environment, over the last decade there has been very little good news. The state of the environment report crystallised that. The report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the state and trend of the environment of Australia is poor and deteriorating because of increasing pressures from climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and resource extraction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changing environmental conditions mean that many species and ecosystems are increasingly threatened, and that is a stark warning—a warning which I hope everyone in this House listens to. We are the mammal extinction capital of the world. What an awful title to have. We have lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. I hope that's sits heavy with us all here. I hope we think about, if we had acted a decade earlier, how many of those mammals we could have saved. So let's not waste time. Let's start acting now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all our different ecological systems, more than half have been found to be in poor state. What did the coalition do in response to this urgent report—a report that was sounding the alarm? It could not have sounded the alarm louder, and yet what did they do? The former environment minister, the member for Farrer, did nothing. Worse than that: she actively hid it from the Australian people. Heads in the sand, those opposite wouldn't even have the courage to own up to their own failings. We can add this to the long litany of failures presided over by those opposite when it comes to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They had a new energy policy almost every month but failed to stick with any of them. They announced recycling targets that sounded good on paper—70 per cent—but failed to get past the 16 per cent mark. They failed to progress our environmental laws despite having the blueprint to go forward. And let's not forget the Leader of the Opposition laughing at our neighbours in the Pacific for their climate change challenges—laughing at them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But their neglect for the environment does not stop there. No, those opposite must feel like they are onto a good thing with this environmental denial, because in this term, after the electorate had sent a very loud and clear message that they wanted action on climate change, that they wanted us to be a more sustainable country where we were protecting our environment—after there was a resounding message sent at the last election, what did those opposite do? They continued to deny. They have opposed the safeguard mechanism, forgoing the chance for bipartisanship where business can invest with certainty when it comes to emissions. Unsurprisingly, they're opposing this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is surprising, though, about their opposition to this bill is that you would think that the party of the free market, the party of business, the pro-capitalist party would back this bill, because this bill seeks at a technical level to establish the legislative framework for a voluntary national market and biodiversity certificates. It would establish a market where proponents of a particular project could buy and sell these certificates on the Nature Repair Market. It would attach a value to the extraordinary flora and fauna that we have in this country so that we would no longer see mammals becoming extinct. It would provide a value to the extraordinary marine life and environment that we have on the Great Barrier Reef so that we would be incentivised to protect it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What it does is provide an opportunity for private money to sit alongside the public money that we are providing through the government to protect our environment. But it's not there to replace government funds; it's there to bolster the significant efforts that we as a government are putting into protecting nature and restoring it, because unlocking private money in a monitored and regulated way is a good way to ensure that there is a broad cross-section of support for conservation efforts. This market would sit within this government's broader Nature Positive Plan, the biggest environmental reform agenda in a generation. It would sit alongside our reform of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the establishment of an independent environmental protection agency and our reform of the use of environmental offsets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are on this side of the House take our obligations to the natural world and to future generations seriously. The scope of this policy will extend to projects that contribute to the enhancement and preservation of existing environments, as well as to projects focused on establishing or rehabilitating habitats. These projects can happen on land, in lakes and rivers, and in marine and coastal environments. Participation will be voluntary and open to all landholders, including farmers, First Nations peoples, conservation groups, businesses and local councils.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once a participant implements a project aimed at repairing or safeguarding nature, they will receive a tradeable certificate as recognition. These certificates will contain standardised information, including the size of the restored land and the nature of the work undertaken for the protection of threatened species. It will enable buyers to gain a precise understanding of their investments and facilitate comparisons and evaluations of different projects. Once approved by the regulatory body, these certificates can be sold to third parties, including philanthropists, businesses, governments or individuals. Landholders will be able to generate additional income from the sale of these certificates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite who say they are on the side of farmers, get behind this bill. It's a system that will assist companies in showcasing their environmental commitments and demonstrating their sustainability efforts. Locally, it will encourage a variety of beneficial environmental work that a landholder might want to do but might not have the money to complete. I want to give an example here that the Minister for the Environment and Water used in her second reading speech, because I think it best illustrates the real advantage of the system that is being proposed here. She said that it could, for example, help:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a farming family, who want to remove invasive plants and manage feral animals on their land so they can better protect a stretch of native forest where endangered greater gliders live; or a group of Indigenous land and sea rangers, who want to control feral species across a coastal floodplain, to protect sea turtles, migratory birds, and to improve water quality for fish and crabs; or another farmer, who wants to replant native grasses and trees on an unproductive stretch of land to make the area more resilient to drought …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think about it in terms of how it could possibly help farmers as well as the environment, I don't understand why those opposite are not backing this bill. There is no shortage of businesses, private individuals and not-for-profits who are keen to do the right thing environmentally. Many are doing it already, whether out of their own goodwill or because of community pressure or shareholder pressure. There is a move to make sure that corporates and the community are assisting with environmental protection, but they're currently doing it without any of the institutional frameworks to assist. We have a surplus of good environmental will, often with nowhere to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this bill does: it builds a bridge between environmental goodwill and positive environmental outcomes. It is the means by which investors can invest in these positive outcomes without owning a plot of land directly and without having to enter into costly contractual arrangements. It allows investors to put their money behind projects that have the confidence of regulators. This leads me to the other important part of this bill: it will introduce the oversight and regulation necessary for this market to function. This is particularly important given the lessons of the Chubb review. I want to commend the bill to the House because I think it's important that we all get behind protecting and restoring our environment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I rise today as the federal member for Durack to speak on two issues that are critically important to my large rural and remote electorate. The first issue is the government's proposed bills to establish a nature repair market, the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023. First things first: we on this side of the House support in principle the creation of a biodiversity market. Indeed, our record in government shows that, with the introduction of the Agriculture Biodiversity Stewardship Market Bill 2022, we actually pioneered work in this area of policy in Australia. The core focus of that bill, which unfortunately lapsed at the conclusion of the 46th Parliament, was to establish the legal framework for a national voluntary Agricultural Biodiversity Stewardship Market to enable agricultural landholders to receive a tradeable certificate for undertaking projects that enhance or protect biodiversity in native species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fair to say that to a large degree these two new bills replicate the comprehensive work, including the significant level of consultation with stakeholders, that we undertook in this area during our time in government. If they were to pass, Labor's bills would likewise legislate for the operation of a national biodiversity market, enabling the Clean Energy Regulator to issue Australian landholders with certificates for projects that preserve, manage and restore nature. They would then be able to sell these certificates to individuals, businesses, other organisations or indeed governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These kinds of markets are generally growing in popularity around the world. There are three main reasons for this: firstly, they incentivise new areas of spending on the environment by private interests; secondly, they allow for improved consultation on the most efficient and effective use of limited public resources; and, thirdly, they help to better prioritise the funding of environmental protection measures by governments. In other words, if their structures and frameworks are carefully and comprehensively designed, then these markets can help to improve and complement government-funded conservation activities by attracting new spending and resources from private individuals and organisations and, accordingly, by enabling governments to direct more of their money away from these forms of conservation towards other environmental priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During our considerable consultation and thinking on this area of policy while in both government and opposition, we have recognised that biodiversity markets genuinely offer the potential for improvements in the way that Australians protect and restore the environmental values of our land. With their two bills, the Labor government is adopting the same broad philosophy, and we commend them for doing so. However—and there's always a 'however'—as has been the case on a number of fronts with this government, these bills contain several aspects that are lacking sufficient detail for anyone to be confident about whether they will be positive and worthwhile changes. In particular, I argue that the proposed extension of the parameters of the biodiversity market from just agricultural land to all land and water tenure needs some further examination to look at the various practical issues that this could lead to. Given that this decision will inevitably lead to more stakeholders and more different kinds of scenarios in the marketplace, there will most likely be a lot of confusion, particularly for first-time entrants to a biodiversity market. Similarly, these bills divert from the considerable amount of work, particularly from ANU, we undertook in basing our legislation strictly on the application to potential projects of the specialised carbon and biodiversity and enhancing remnant vegetation assessment models.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some concerns and reservations about an opening-up of the parameters and methodologies by which projects can be designed and assessed and how certificates can be traded. Additionally there are a number of further complexities and risks that the bill creates around precisely whose consent will be needed for projects to go ahead. Similarly there is an absence of key detail around what criteria and also evidence the minister will consider when making decisions on potentially excluding projects under section 33 of the Nature Repair Market Bill. In turn there are a lack of defined standards or controls around biodiversity assessment instruments and on the precise role of the native title body corporate. This added complexity and risk needs to be subjected to detailed scrutiny, and therefore it is appropriate that the bills be referred to the Senate Environment and Communications Committee. The opposition will reserve its final position on these bills until we see and hear what emerges from that committee process, but as things currently stand we have sufficient doubts about the veracity and quality of this legislation to not vote in support of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also concerned about the prolonging of this process. Rather than build on and complement the comprehensive work that had already done for them by the coalition, the Albanese government bizarrely decided to go back to the drawing board and started the consultation process all over again. This has meant they needlessly prolonged processes and tried to reinvent the wheel and that they have generated more consultation fatigue, more irritation, more frustration and more consternation among key stakeholders than should have been the case. From evidence provided at the October 2022 Senate estimates hearing it seems the Clean Energy Regulator and the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water probably spent around $11.4 million in carrying out these 100 per cent unnecessary activities. We thank the many stakeholders, however, who did engage. Thank you very much for being a part of the process. We thank them for the work that they did whilst we were in government and those who continue to work with us in opposition to help chart the path for a successful biodiversity market in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disappointingly, it isn't just at the federal level where Labor are writing uncertainty into law. In my home state of WA the Labor government has rammed through parliament its new Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021. From 1 July landowners with more than 1,100 square metres will come up against more red tape for basic activities like clearing and planting trees, building a fence, putting in a bore or digging a dam. Undertaking any of these activities on your own land could mean you could have to engage local Aboriginal cultural heritage services, known as LACHS, at your own expense to get a permit. Kimberley Land Council and other Aboriginal groups have condemned the laws, claiming native title groups are vastly under-resourced for their rollout and pointing out that the LACHS are still not established. Labor themselves aren't even ready for their own laws to come into effect, with the permit system still not ready just weeks out from their starting to be enforced from 1 July. They are still not ready. These are just some of the issues with the state government's complex new regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no surprise that WA's farmers and pastoralists, many of whom are from my electorate, are calling this shambolic. WA Farmers President John Hassell outlined that it's open to such bad interpretation that it's going to cause major drama in the sector. Understandably they are calling for a six-month delay on the commencement of the act so that these issues can be worked through constructively. Already more than 27,000 concerned Western Australians have signed a local petition for a delay. I want to give credit to the Hon Neil Thomson for facilitating this Tony Seabrook petition.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How has WA Labor responded? The new, unelected Premier likened the calls of thousands of locals in Western Australia to this delay as a dog returning to its vomit. West Australians are right to be concerned and confused about the new regulations and simply want answers, but this seems too hard for the new Premier Cook, who is on L-plates, clearly. They have instead resorted to slurs because they have botched the implementation of their own regulations. Western Australians are quickly finding out what this new Premier's priorities are. He has confirmed that one of his first acts as Premier was to call the rugby league boss to lobby for a team in Western Australia. Don't get me wrong: I love rugby league—I love rugby union a little bit more, I have to say—and I could get behind a WA team. But, Premier, if you have enough time to spare to listen to the NRL, you should take the time to listen to our WA farmers, instead of insulting and ignoring them. Our farmers are the lifeblood of our state, and they deserve better from this useless state Labor government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, we on this side of the House, like all Australian, believe in protecting our diversity and also our sensitive Indigenous historical sights, but let's do it in way that constructively works with Australians; let's not take the Labor approach of confusing or imposing on Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Durack for her contribution to this debate. It was heartening to hear some of the positive comments she made about this important piece of legislation, the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023, particularly after being privy to the contribution made by the member for New England today, which led me to believe that all of those opposite believe that there is no problem—nothing needs to be fixed—and that anything implying we should take action, as a government, to protect or repair our natural environment, which has been degraded over time, is lunacy. That is what I took from the member for New England's contribution earlier today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems I have with the member for Durack's contribution, though, is that she says, on the one hand, this government had taken too long and had done too much consultation, while, on the other hand, the Western Australian government has not taken long enough and not done enough consultation—both talking about similar things. I note, too, that the member for Durack's comments about the consultation that happened when the coalition was in government around a biodiversity market included deep conversation with farmers. There was some criticism in the member's contribution that the member for Sydney, as the minister for the environment, had taken this more broadly, beyond farmers and to other areas of our community, and that that was somehow the wrong thing to do, after the former government had done so much work. I take it that means that some work had been done on the notion of a biodiversity market. This piece of legislation, having been introduced by the member for Sydney, is about a nature repair market that goes beyond farmland and includes marine considerations. It is not surprising that those opposite are not embracing the notion of this going beyond current farmland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a bit about my electorate, which is home to a Ramsar wetland. The Ramsar site is at the mouth of the Werribee River, where it reaches the bay. This wetland is home to birdlife that comes from all over the globe at different times of the year. As breeding season comes, birds fly in from as far as Russia. They travel across the globe to come to this site, hence its protection under the Ramsar wetlands agreement. Sitting right beside it is land that was once farmland and on which sits the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works sewage treatment plant. On a drive from my electorate to the member for Hawke's electorate, I would see sheep grazing and maybe paddocks full of grain. Now, alarmingly, we see paddocks full of rocks, paddocks full of rabbits and, bluntly, paddocks full of noxious weeds sitting in very close proximity to what is an international site.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, the most important thing that this market would do is incentivise those people who are holding that current land. Let's face it, I know I represent a growth corridor, and I know that there's a lot of prospecting going on, with farmland being purchased and then left fallow, left so that we've got noxious weeds at a rate that I have not seen since I was a child. This is a danger. It's a danger to neighbouring farmers. It's a danger to anyone who wants to stay in the business of farming. It's a danger to the Ramsar wetland. If this bill incentivises people to take action to reverse that, then that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned, a very good thing in my electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not a surprise for me that those opposite are a bit torn about this piece of legislation. As the member for Durack pointed out, they'd done a lot of work around a market. Last week, after listening to contributions from those opposite, I was struggling to understand why the party of the market, the party that's so often criticised for letting the market rip, were coming in, one after the other, to criticise a bill that was going to create a new market and a market in an area that all Australians will benefit from. This market comes into being with the appropriate regulations around it, with the appropriate oversight around it and with the expansion of it beyond current farmland and into all areas of our great country. If it incentivises private capital investment into those spaces, this could be a real game changer for us as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues of mine have talked about our commitment on this side to environmental protection. This bill does more than environmental protection. This bill is about repairing degradation. This bill is about giving nature a chance, about getting a natural footprint back into areas where that's possible. But it's not a surprise to me that those opposite are struggling with this concept. We know that the former minister, now the deputy opposition leader, the member for Farrer, hid a report from the Australian people—a report that landed last year, the official five-yearly report card on the Australian environment called the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report. That report landed but was hidden from view, not tabled in this place, not available to the public. We know why: because, after nearly 10 years of coalition government, it was a catalogue of horrors. It showed just how much damage a decade of Liberal and National Party neglect did to our environment. As those on this side have said, one of the primary things that report found was that Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. We're standing in a building where above us, on our coat of arms, we have an emu and a kangaroo—because they don't take a backward step—to note that we have lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. For the first time, Australia has more foreign plant species than native. Some of those foreign plant species will be noxious weeds, and I know in my part of the world that's certainly the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I travel anywhere, after weeks away from home one of the things I do to ground myself back in the electorate is get in the car and drive across the Iramoo plains in the direction of the You Yangs, a path I've taken since I was a child. It grounds me, and it reminds me of where I am. It is depressing doing that drive now and seeing those paddocks being overtaken by weeds—absolutely depressing. Habitat the size of Tasmania has been cleared between 2000 and 2017. Plastics are choking our oceans with up to 80,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometre. In December 2019, flow in most Murray-Darling rivers had reached record low levels. That record becomes exposed while we debate action in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the member for Sydney for the work she has done in broadening the scope of her deliberations, in broadening the scope of the public hearings and consultation that has occurred, and in landing for us a bill that will see the development of a nature repair market and the regulations set around that to ensure we get this investment right. This bill will ensure we attract private investment and make it easier for businesses and philanthropists to invest in efforts of nature repair. This bill supports landholders including farmers and First Nations communities to do things like plant native species, repair damaged riverbeds and remove invasive species. These are incredibly important things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is delivering on its Nature Positive Plan with the establishment of this repair market. This market will make it easier for businesses, organisations, governments and individuals to invest in projects to protect and repair nature. We've committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030. As I speak, I am reminded of one of the other things the previous government did upon coming to office, and that was halving the national marine parks. That was an extraordinary act that undid groundbreaking work and wound the clock back. But we shouldn't be surprised because, as a government, they had 22 energy policies and failed to land one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country we need to be standing up internationally and taking action on climate change and making positive changes in our energy market. Those opposite are having trouble coming in here and supporting the repair of our natural habitats across this great country. They seem to be in a time warp where you're either for farmers or you're against farmers. You can be for farmers and for nature. I'm from farmers and I know lots of farming families that have been actively involved in Landcare projects and planting trees. But in this chamber we get this picture of farmers as if they are completely and utterly centred on their own business at the expense of this country. They're not the farmers I know; they're not the farmers I represent. I represent farmers who will come to a meeting to talk about climate change and talk about action on climate change. I work with farmers who are scientists in the way they grow produce on their farms. I think that my farmers will welcome the Nature Repair Market Bill. My market gardeners, my vegetable growers will welcome the opportunity to have weeds eradicated from the dryer paddocks two kilometres away from where they're currently doing four crops of vegetables a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">
                    </span>It is timely that this legislation is in the chamber. It has been interesting listening from this side of the debate to the varying points of view from those opposite. I welcome some of the positive comments made by the member for Durack and hope that those opposite decide that the integrity of environmental outcomes is an important thing and something that they should support. I hope they think about the work they did in government around a biodiversity market. I hope they take that knowledge to this piece of legislation, unlike the other things that have been policies of theirs in government that they have walked into this place and voted against. I am desperately hoping that this legislation makes a difference in communities like mine, makes a difference across this great country and makes a difference to places like the Great Barrier Reef. I think it is a real positive in terms of looking for and finding ways for our remote communities to also be involved in this marketplace and bringing together those who love this country, whether they have had an attachment to this country for 65,000 years or, like lots of people that I represent, they have only been in the country for less than five years. I hope that this legislation is something that everyone in my electorate can support. I hope that business and philanthropists get behind this market and make a difference in communities like mine. </span>

The same goals have been adopted globally under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. These goals reinforce the findings of the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment </span>report,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which confirmed that our natural environment is in poor condition and getting worse. A number of my constituents provided essential work in relation to putting that report together. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment </span>report has noted that all aspects of the Australian environment are under pressure and many are declining. Although there have been numerous environmental initiatives at national, state and territory levels, there has been insufficient overall investment and a lack of coordination to be able to adequately address the growing impacts from climate change, land clearing, invasive species, pollution and urban expansion. Australia has lost more mammal species than any other continent and continues to have one of the highest rates of species decline among countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of the many advocacy groups in Bean who have raised these concerns over the long-term sustainability and repair of the environment in Canberra and across the country, including the Landcare, Waterwatch and ParkCare groups. On indulgence, in support of one these groups: in March of this year I partnered with the Conservation Council ACT Region's Bush Buds program. My official 'bush bud' was the gang-gang cockatoo, beloved across the Canberra community as the territory's fauna emblem. Gang-gangs can be seen at all times of the year, nesting during spring and early summer in hollow-bearing trees. Sometimes you can see them in my backyard. A favoured food of Canberra's gang-gangs is the buds and gumnuts of the southern blue gum, a common planting of inner Canberra's parks and avenues. Sadly, gang-gang populations across Australia have suffered a 70 per cent decline in the last two decades. Fortunately, Canberra's population appears to be steady, and that's despite some serious threats from the 2020 Namadgi fires. Unfortunately, steep population declines are being driven across the country by native habitat loss, an issue that is growing as a major threat for many species across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Community advocacy groups like these, right around the country, have unfortunately been burdened with the responsibility of addressing environmental preservation and restoration because of a lack of direction from the previous Liberal-National government. That lack of direction has meant that Australia's strategies and investment in biodiversity conservation do not match the scale of the challenge. The state and trend of Australia's ecosystems and species continue to decline. That improves with the introduction of this bill. In response to these ongoing shortfalls, the Albanese government is committed to delivering better environmental protection and reforms as part of the Nature Positive Plan. One of these reforms is creating the nature repair market. By encouraging voluntary private sector investment, the market will make a significant contribution to restoring Australia's natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill establishes a transparent framework to issue Australian landholders with tradeable biodiversity certificates for projects that protect, manage and restore nature. It will enable the Clean Energy Regulator to issue Australian landholders with tradeable biodiversity certificates for projects that protect, manage and restore nature. These certificates can then be sold to businesses, organisations, governments and individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government understands that business and private sector investment can make a significant contribution to nature repair. Businesses are increasingly looking for ways to demonstrate their environmental credentials and positive outcomes for nature. Several groups currently estimate the market for biodiversity in Australia as potentially unlocking $137 billion in financial flows by 2050. With this bill, we are now responding to that demand. But this is not just a market for businesses or landholders. Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, conservation groups and farmers can participate. Projects will deliver long-term nature-positive outcomes through activities such as weeding, planting native species and pest control. They can be undertaken on land and water. This includes lakes and rivers as well as marine and coastal environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Open participation and extensive opportunity for project locations will support regional Australia through jobs and nature-positive economic activity. Projects in this program could include removing drainage ditches, excluding livestock and feral herbivores to restore a natural marsh, which will create critical habitat for diverse native frog, fish, turtle and wetland bird species. Indigenous rangers will undertake feral animal exclusion, buffalo grass removal, feral cat control, cultural burning in the Central Desert. The certificate generated for such a project could support the activities of Indigenous rangers working on country for many years to restore seagrass meadow permanently lost from historical poor catchment water quality, providing habitat for sea turtles, dugongs, marine fish and seahorses. Monitoring could be provided by local commercial and recreational fishers, who foresee increased local fish stocks. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also enable participation, and create employment and economic opportunities for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. It will promote and enable free, prior and informed consent for projects on their land or waters. There will be opportunities to design projects that reflect the knowledge and connection to country of our First Nations people and to utilise their skills and knowledge for a nature positive future. Who better to inform the repair of our delicate ecosystems than those with a 65,000 year connection to it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The market will operate in parallel with the carbon market, facilitated by having the same regulator. The alignment will encourage carbon farming projects and also deliver benefits also for biodiversity. There will be administrative efficiencies in this approach and, more importantly, clear and accurate oversight of claims made in both markets. The government acknowledges the recent review of carbon crediting led by Professor Ian Chubb. Lessons learnt from the carbon market have informed the bill and will continue to be reflected upon as environmental markets develop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market will be based on science—that is a good thing to hear for a change—and underpinned by legislation to ensure its integrity. It will encourage investment in future repair and drive environmental improvements across Australia. There are seven provisions in this bill that will support the development of a Nature Repair Market. Firstly, this bill will create an independent expert Nature Repair Market committee to advise the minister on scheme integrity. The committee will have five to six experts with substantial experience and significant standing in one or more areas of expertise, including agriculture, science, environmental markets, land management, economics or Indigenous knowledge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will have the methodology determination setting out the requirements for different types of projects which are made by the minister, following advice from the nature repair market committee that the methodology meets legislative biodiversity integrity standards. There will be requirements for biodiversity projects to be undertaken in line with that methodology determination. There will also be a consistent way of measuring improvements in biodiversity, set out in an overarching biodiversity assessment instrument. This bill will create tradeable biodiversity certificates that are regulated to ensure they provide accurate information about projects. Critically—and I know constituents from my electorate of Bean will be interested to know this—this scheme won't be used as offsets unless and until they meet these new standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market will be an opportunity to create a supply of projects certified through purpose-designed offset methods. The register will be a comprehensive and public source of information on these projects and the biodiversity they are protecting. In addition to this, a public register of projects and certificates will include information about their ownership and provide access to reports about project delivery and environmental outcomes. Transparency will be a core element of the scheme. Comprehensive information about projects and certificates will be available on that public register. Additional information will be regularly published by the regulator, and there will be active release of relevant data by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This will enable parliament and the public to monitor the scheme and provide an opportunity for citizen oversight. It will support certainty and value to the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill will act as an assurance and compliance framework to maintain integrity in the market and provide confidence that projects are being delivered as expected. We know that under those opposite environmental management was simply not a thing. We knew that, and the people of Bean knew that. The report that has been referenced a few times in this speech—the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report—was finally released last year after being buried by the former environment minister. The release of this report revealed why it had been buried. The report revealed the true cost of nine years of Liberal and National neglect and environmental vandalism. Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. For the first time, Australia has more foreign plant species than native. Habitat the size of Tasmania has been cleared. Plastics are choking our oceans—up to 80,000 pieces of plastics per square kilometre. Flows in most Murray-Darling rivers have reached record-low levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dire state of the environment is not due to just neglect; it is the result of an unholy hybrid assault of willing neglect and active environmental vandalism. What did those opposite really do for the environment? They axed climate laws. They failed to fix Australia's broken environment laws despite having a widely supported blueprint to do so. They laughed about our Pacific Island neighbours going underwater. They failed to land a single one of their 22 different energy policies. They sabotaged the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They promised $40 million of Indigenous water—who can guess how much they delivered? They set recycling targets with no plan to actually deliver them. They voted against the safeguard mechanism—the policy that they had previously championed. They cut highly protected areas of marine parks in half—and believe it or not, Bean has got marine parks around Norfolk Island. They cut billions from our environment department. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report identified what a pathway forward looked like. That pathway required greater national leadership—no wonder those opposite weren't interested. That much-needed leadership was needed to help foster a coordinated action and encourage investment to address our mounting environmental and heritage issues. Australia needed to measure progress and undertake effective, adaptive actions. Significant new effort is required to consistently manage environmental and heritage matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its core, this bill is pretty simple. The Albanese Labor government is making it easier for people to invest in activities that help repair nature. We on this side want to leave nature better off for our kids and grandkids. That's why we're delivering legislation that supports landholders, including farmers, First Nations communities and community groups do to things like plant native species, repair damaged riverbeds or remove invasive species. This bill will establish a new market for investing in nature-positive outcomes. It creates the nature repair market with proper integrity and transparency, giving business and philanthropists a way to invest in nature with confidence. The market will make it easier for businesses, organisations, governments and individuals to invest in projects to protect and repair nature. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was elected to be part of a government that would take leadership on these issues. Climate action and our precious environment were towards the top of the issues people voted on in Bean, and I am proud that we are tackling these issues. It is of no surprise it has been left to a Labor government to show courage and leadership on environmental issues. I thank the minister for her dedication and work in this space, and I commend this bill to House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  In our part of the world we are pretty lucky: rolling hills, big valleys, healthy and productive waterways. We have some of the best agricultural land in the world and our farmers are also world-class. I would call them the best in the world, although I have to confess I am a little biased. We are part of the great food basket of Australia. We also have many sites of cultural significance with First Nations people working to protect and promote the rich cultural heritage of our area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 presents a wonderful opportunity for the people of our area and across Australia to restore, repair and protect the incredible natural resources we have. I don't know a single farmer who doesn't take their responsibility to protect and improve the land they work on extremely seriously. This bill gives our farmers and other landowners the ability to make a real difference to our environment while also supplementing farming income. It is a win-win for farmers and the environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian biodiversity market has been estimated to be worth $137 billion, more than half of which is forecast to be driven by biodiversity, conservation and natural-capital-themed bonds, loans, debt and equity. I note that the Australian government has suggested that unlocking this potential investment is critical to reversing the long-term decline in Australian biodiversity, revealed in the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report, which found that Australia's environment is in poor and deteriorating condition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, as a regional MP, farmers and the land are at the heart of the work that I do here. As I have already stated, our local farmers, orchardists and vignerons are some of the strongest environmentalists you will find anywhere. This takes the form of soil and pasture improvements, weed control, erosion rectification, tree planting, reducing the use of chemicals where possible, the improvement of waterways and smarter cropping techniques. They aim to make sure their farms and the land is passed on to the next generation so that it continues to produce the food and wealth of our nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Charles Sturt University Orange campus Loam Bio, with the support of the Australian government, is revolutionising carbon farming. It's very exciting, cutting-edge stuff. In Calare there are proximally 105 animals and plants that are threatened or endangered. Species such as the Bathurst copper butterfly, Littlejohn's tree frog and the regent honeyeater are all endangered, and plants such as the silver leaved mountain gum and the Rylstone bell are facing a similar fate. The time to act is now, and I'm supportive of this bill that provides tangible benefits for businesses and farmers choosing to support Australian biodiversity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the proposed nature repair market, all landholders will be able to participate, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, with a wide range of projects considered eligible. This would recognise that landholders have different circumstances, interests and aspirations, and would encourage participation and increase supply. Projects will be wide-ranging and could involve replanting or nature restoration that increases carbon storage or improves biodiversity or the management of existing vegetation to improve habitat condition or outcomes for native species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020, the then environment minister appointed Professor Graeme Samuel to conduct an independent review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, also known as the EPBC Act. As per recommendation 28 of the Samuel review, the Nature Repair Market Bill is fostering private participation in biodiversity restoration and is building the nature repair market off the back of key elements proposed in the Nature Positive Plan last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government, I note, is also in the process of implementing further recommendations in the Samuel review. These commitments include introducing national environmental standards, including standards on environmental offsets, and a federal environment protection authority. While I acknowledge that in an ideal world changes to the EPBC Act would have coincided with the introduction of the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023, I also accept that the EPBC amendments are a much larger body of work. Introducing the Nature Repair Market Bill before the EPBC Act amendments means that farmers in my area can reap the rewards sooner, and it encourages greater investment into enhancing Australian biodiversity</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the bill, it's proposed that certain conditions and requirement will need to be met before an application is made to the Clean Energy Regulator for the issuance of a biodiversity certificate. Such requirements will include that the project is sufficiently progressed to have resulted in or likely to result in the biodiversity outcomes for the project, that the proponent is a fit and proper person and that the eligibility requirements and criteria have been met. Certificates are only issued for biodiversity protection or enhancement that would not normally have occurred and therefore provide a genuine environmental benefit. Essentially, biodiversity certificates will be a form of tradeable personal property which can be purchased, transferred, claimed, used and publicly tracked. These certificates will enable biodiversity outcomes to be owned and traded separately from the underlying land. Buyers are expecting to be able to invest in nature to achieve philanthropic objectives, meet their social and environmental responsibilities, compensate for their impacts on nature and manage risks associated with their dependencies on nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of the Clean Energy Regulator would include registering projects, issuing certificates, maintaining the public register of projects, undertaking compliance and enforcement, and providing oversight of the market. The bill also provides for the establishment and administration of a public register known as the Biodiversity Market Register to facilitate transparency, accountability and market efficiency. This will track issuance, ownership, transfer, relinquishment and cancellation of biodiversity certificates and will be managed by the Clean Energy Regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The public Biodiversity Market Register will enable information relating to each biodiversity project to be reviewed, compared and scrutinised by the public. I believe this is essential in ensuring there is public accountability for the projects within the Biodiversity Market Register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in an incredible country, and I want it to be just as incredible for the many generations to come. That is why I'm supporting this bill and supporting its objective to give farmers and landholders a tangible benefit for protecting or enhancing the biodiversity make-up of their land. I commend the National Party and the opposition for developing the key components of this bill. It is great work. I hope they can swing in behind it. And I think the minister's office for their engagement in this important legislation. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury, Assistant Minister for Employment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  In 1984 EO Wilson popularised the notion of biophilia, what he called 'the urge to affiliate with other forms of life'. His 1984 book was a bestseller and reminds us that many of us are at our best when we're in nature. I tend to start the day with a run. At first, I did it mostly for exercise purposes, but then I realised one of the reasons it's really good for my head is I'm fortunate to live near Mount Majura and Mount Ainslie, so I get to spend time with the kangaroos and the kookaburras and the spiders and the galahs and all the rest. That always seems to set the day up, as it did this morning. As I run through that area I'll often think about the lessons that I've learned about that part of the world from Tyronne Bell, a Ngunawal man who took the time to take my family and me through parts of the Mount Majura and Mount Ainslie reserves, showing us where the scar trees were, where the traditional areas were and the way in which country has been used for millennia by First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market is going to be important for First Nations communities, which is critical for the work those First Nations people do right across this country. We know that more than 60 per cent of Australia is privately held, and of that land, the majority is owned by farmers and First Nations people. We know too that those areas are where a large share of critical habitats exist and where some of our most endangered animals live. This bill will support landowners to do things like planting native species, repairing damaged riverbeds or removing invasive species. This bill will do so in a way that ensures a market that is open to all landholders. Farmers, First Nations, conservation groups, businesses and local councils will be eligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this bill is the principle that, when a landowner conducts a project to repair or protect nature, they will be issued with a tradeable certificate. As an economist I am strongly in favour of tradeable permit schemes, and this one will provide a range of standardised information, such as the size of land repaired, the kind of work conducted, the threatened species protected and the length of time the actions will continue. That will help buyers understand what they are investing in. Once those projects are approved by the regulator, those certificates can then be sold. They might be sold to a philanthropist, a government or an individual, and that will provide additional income for landholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would let corporations demonstrate their environmental credentials, and it'll help philanthropists achieve their mission. Right now we have the challenge that, if philanthropists want to support nature repair, then they have to either buy the land themselves or find a willing landowner to enter into a complicated management agreement, and that's frustrating for everyone. Companies aren't generally in the business of environmental management. They shouldn't have to own land in order to protect it. What we want to do is ensure that farmers and First Nations people can continue to steward the land. They don't need to sell the land outright or initiate complex legal agreements. Instead they can find projects they want to support and get the tradeable permits from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What might that mean in practice? It might involve a farming family who wish to remove invasive plants and manage feral animals on their land or to better protect a stretch of native forest where endangered greater gliders live. It might involve a group of Indigenous land and sea rangers who want to control feral species across a coastal flood plain to protect sea turtles and migratory birds or improve water quality for fish and crabs. It might entail farmers who want to replant native grasses and trees on an unproductive stretch of land to make the area more resilient to drought and salinity or a group of fishers who want to regrow a meadow of seagrass, previously killed by poor water quality, to provide a habitat for dugongs, turtles and seahorses. These are just some of the examples, and the scheme is flexible enough to mean that landowners can do whatever environmental work is needed in their area. That might involve helping to support the east coast koala population, reviving critical nature corridors where animals travel for food and shelter or to avoid bushfires or replanting hillside vegetation to stop erosion and protect their local soil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This provides a straightforward scheme and, importantly, a transparent scheme. The regulator will publish information on projects and the ownership and use of certificates, actively release relevant data and allow parliament and citizens to scrutinise the scheme. This scheme sits in conjunction with the recent review of carbon crediting led by Professor Ian Chubb, and we are keen to ensure that nature markets are properly regulated. These markets will not work if there is an element of greenwashing, if there isn't a national regulator enforcing the rules and ensuring compliance. The conservationists and organisations who want to support nature repair need trust and integrity around this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the importance of protecting the land and seas. The Australian government has a commitment to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030. That's the same goal that's been adopted globally under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, and it's going to require significant investment. This nature repair market will be based on science and will ensure the ongoing integrity of the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will enable the Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority with significant expertise in regulating environmental markets, to issue Australian landowners with tradeable biodiversity certificates. The nature of this market is such that it will be transparent, as I mentioned, and that the department will work with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to ensure that certificates issued in the nature repair market are not victims of greenwashing claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms come before the House at a time in which Australians are showing a strong commitment to improving the natural environment. I have been pleased, over recent years, to hold a number of park clean-up barbecue events. They're always terrifically well attended by the local community and supported by Canberrans who want to improve their local environment. We've held these in grasslands around the electorate, bringing people together with gloves and bags. People go out and pick up garbage or pull out weeds, then we all wash our hands and enjoy a good barbecue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We get a terrific turnout, too, in the ACT for Clean Up Australia Day, held, as members know, on the first Sunday of March each year. It was a real pleasure this year to have Clean Up Australia CEO Jenny Geddes come to the Hackett shops, in Canberra, to help with Clean Up Australia Day. Jenny did that because we were celebrating 20 years of activism on Clean Up Australia Day by Terry de Luca, who's been the Clean Up Australia coordinator in Hackett for a full two decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we discuss these issues, I think, too, of the important work done by Indigenous rangers in the Booderee National Park, part of the Jervis Bay Territory that forms a portion of the electorate of Fenner. As you know, Deputy Speaker, when the founders set up the ACT they took the view that every capital city needs its own port. So, in the Jervis Bay, we have the Booderee National Park, and the work of the Indigenous rangers there, and it might be that they're able to tap into the nature repair market to augment the vital work they do with philanthropic support to improve the local work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in parliament this week, we're going to be pleased to be able to hear, tomorrow night, from one of Australia's greatest authors, Tim Winton, who has produced a documentary this year called <span style="font-style:italic;">Ningaloo Nyinggulu</span>. That is a three-part documentary that talks about the Ningaloo Marine Park and the inland desert areas. The documentary, which I commend to members of the House, shows the extraordinary beauty of the whale sharks, the green turtles, the humpback whales and other species in that area. The Ningaloo Marine Park got its World Heritage status in 2011—not coincidentally, a year in which Labor was in office. Labor's commitment to expanding our marine parks network is one which has carried through from the Rudd and Gillard governments to the Albanese government, and to our strong support for improving the natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, we work very closely with Indigenous Australians. Indigenous Australians have been on this continent for over 60 millennia. European settlers have been here for just a quarter of a millennium, yet in that time Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. Right now, Australia has more foreign plant species than native. From the years 2000 to 2017, habitat the size of Tasmania was cleared. Plastics are currently choking the world's oceans, including the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area in which there is so much plastic that, in parts, you can actually walk on top of the plastics.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the last decade, when the Liberals and Nationals were in office, we saw them axing climate laws; failing to fix Australia's broken environmental laws, despite having a widely supported blueprint to do so; failing to land a single one of their 22 different energy policies; sabotaging the Murray-Darling Basin Plan; promising $40 million in Indigenous water but never delivering a drop; setting recycling targets but with no plan to achieve those recycling targets; and laughing, as the Leader of the Opposition did, about our Pacific island neighbours going underwater. Since the change of government they have voted against the safeguard mechanism despite it being a policy that they previously championed. The safeguard mechanism was designed by Tony Abbott, yet when Labor in office sought to make it work the coalition voted against it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government cut highly protected areas of marine parks in half and cut billions of dollars from our environment department. The former Liberal-National government had a recycling target of 70 per cent, yet recycling in Australia was stuck at 16 per cent for four years. That's what happens when you have a target but no plan to deliver it. That's why Labor not only has set a 43 per cent emissions reduction target but has a plan to get there. If you're wondering why our emissions reduction target doesn't end in a 0, it's because we didn't pluck a target out of the air and then figure how to get there. The target is based on our plan to improve Australia's environmental performance by steadily reducing our carbon footprint, by expanding the renewables share of electricity generation from one-third to four-fifths between now and 2030 and by ensuring that the safeguard mechanism delivers what it's meant to do. It is a shocking environmental record that those opposite left us when we came into office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to be part of a government that voted for significant climate action in this parliament last year, and I'm pleased now to be standing up on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023, a bill that will make a tangible difference to communities across the country, allowing farmers and First Nations peoples to carry out environmental remediation, allowing corporations to be part of the acquitted positive environmental impact and allowing philanthropists to step up to the plate with the confidence that, if they're paying for environmental repair, that environmental repair will be delivered. The transparency that backs it is the same transparency that has led the Albanese government to put in place a National Anti-Corruption Commission. We are committed to good government and committed to the environment. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  I rise to support the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. Let's get something clear. This government was elected to act on climate change, we were elected to stop the decade of damage to our country's unique natural environment caused by successive coalition governments, and we were elected to repair our natural environment with a whole-of-community effort, bringing together businesses, organisations, governments and grassroots groups to tackle this existential threat to our way of life. Our objective is to leave our planet, our country and our natural environment in a better place for future generations. We don't want to trash it for short-term gains, which was exactly what those opposite did for almost a decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the story of the coalition's record on the environment from the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the Environment Report</span>, the very same report that the now deputy opposition leader hid from the Australian people, and the findings of this report show why. It was embarrassing. It said that the environment suffered devastating damage and it predicted it would only get worse. Specifically, the report found Australia had lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent—more than any other continent—and, for the first time in this continent's history, Australia has more foreign plan species than native species. That is absolutely shocking. The destruction of our biodiversity, the deleterious effects of decades of neglect. And to make matters worse, between 2000 and 2017 habitat the size of Tasmania has been cleared. That is the size of an entire state in less than two decades. Forests gone, many of which will never be replaced or will take decades to replace. This was the mess left behind by those opposite. That was a decade when the word 'government' seemed to cover everything but the environment, a decade where climate laws were axed, where environment laws were broken, where 22 different energy policies were floated but never landed and where billions of dollars were cut from our environment department. It is clear what the coalition thought about our natural environment when they were in government. It was just another program to be cut so they could save a billion dollars here and a billion dollars there. They wanted to keep claiming the title of better economic managers and even then they couldn't manage a single budget surplus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now more than ever we need to make significant investments in conservation and protection of our natural heritage to secure a better environment for our future, an environment worth inheriting from us for future generations, an environment entrusted to us by previous generations. When I say that protecting our environment is an investment, I really do mean it, not just in the social and cultural benefits but in the significant economic benefits just waiting to be unlocked. When a recent independent report was done on the market for biodiversity in Australia, an estimated $137 billion in financial flows by 2050 were discovered. That is a huge long-term economic opportunity that was left untapped by the former government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that around the world countries that have preserved their environment have reached enormous economic dividends. Whether it be in tourism or natural industries or agriculture, environmental protection has made good economic sense. Those countries that have degraded their environments, that have allowed the quality of their land to erode, that have allowed their forests to be cut down, their rivers and seas to be polluted, have inflicted on themselves terrible economic damage. With this bill we are not only taking advantage of the economic opportunity afforded by the environment but we are also putting forward real solutions, and making a real effort when it comes to protecting our natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 provides a framework for a voluntary national market that delivers on improved biodiversity outcomes. Eligible landholders who undertake projects that enhance or protect our nature and its biodiversity can receive a tradeable certificate tracked through a national register. This bill will also enable the Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority, to issue Australian landholders with these tradeable biodiversity certificates. These certificates can then be sold to businesses, organisations, governments and individuals. Establishing this market in legislation will ensure its ongoing integrity while encouraging and growing investment in nature. This in turn will help drive environmental improvements across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This market will operate in parallel with the existing carbon market. Both markets will be facilitated by the same proven and independent authority. This alignment will also make it easier for intersections in projects, encouraging carbon farming also to deliver benefits for biodiversity. The parallel operation of these markets will also address one of the biggest concerns when it comes to introducing Nature Repair Market implementation. By administering this market through the Clean Energy Regulator, the Nature Repair Market will benefit not only from the regulator's experience but from the administrative efficiencies that come from having clear and accurate oversight of claims made in both markets. Importantly, this bill and the establishment of the Nature Repair Market has been informed by the recent review of carbon crediting by Professor Ian Chubb. Lessons learned from the carbon market have been taken into account and will continue to be reflected on as environmental markets continue to develop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and the Nature Repair Market are important parts of our Nature Positive Plan. The government published this plan in December last year in response to the shocking findings of the 2021 state of the environment report. Our government's response, outlined in the Nature Positive Plan, is guided by three fundamental principles. First is the need to better protect Australia's environment and prevent further extinction of native flora and fauna. Second is the need for faster decision-making and clear priorities when it comes to action on environmental protections. Third is the need to restore public accountability and trust in environmental decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill begins the process of repairing our nature by acting on all three of these points. In particular, this bill and the design of the Nature Repair Market reflect our commitment to restoring public accountability and trust. In fact, transparency will be the core element of this scheme. Comprehensive information about projects and certificates will be made available on a public register, and additional information will be published by the regulator alongside active releases of relevant data by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This will help both the parliament and the public to monitor this scheme and allow for citizen oversight. This stands in stark contrast to those opposite, whose approach was guided by lack of transparency and hiding facts from the Australian people when it came to damage to our biodiversity, the rise in energy costs or the impacts of climate change. We saw on that side a decade of denial, delay and hidden information. The approach in this bill, consistent with the approach of this government more broadly, is about delivering transparency, openness and accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Nature Positive Plan states, restoring public accountability and trust is not good just for its own sake; it provides key economic benefits as well. Restoring public accountability and trust is key to supporting certainty and value in the market and for investors. When coupled with the second principle—faster decision-making and clearer priorities—accountability and trust can be important to de-risk investments and promote sustainable economic development. Implemented as part of the Nature Positive Plan's recommendations, they have the potential to assist in long-term economic growth, increase employment, create jobs and support a greater capacity to invest in the environment and social priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Positive Plan also states what we all know. It states the obvious: that a healthy and resilient environment is necessary for a vibrant economy. Over a decade, we watched the so-called better economic managers, as the coalition like to think of themselves, hard at work. But, strangely enough, they weren't hard at work delivering better environmental climate policies. They certainly weren't hard at work delivering budget surpluses or strong jobs growth. What they were was hard at work stoking the flames of climate war—rather than delivering on climate policies—and watching our environment degrade and our biodiversity decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, Tony Abbott said the science of human-caused climate change was 'crap', and he even went so far as to claim that climate change was 'probably doing good'. This is a former Liberal prime minister talking about the environment that we all rely on and will hand down to our kids. That same year Malcolm Turnbull admitted that his own party 'does not believe in human-caused global warming'. As he left office, Malcolm Turnbull said that his biggest regret was failure to secure meaningful climate policies. They're honest when they leave. It's a shame they're not as honest when they're in the parliament. Mr Turnbull didn't blame Labor for the lack of climate policies. He didn't blame a lack of business support. He didn't even blame vested interests. He blamed his own party, a party that he saw as having a reckless disregard for Australia and the global environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over this decade, the coalition saw climate change as a political thorn in its side, an inconvenient conversation that needed to be shut down, pushed aside and silenced. But in doing so, they missed the voices of businesses across Australia who cried out for leadership—leadership on climate and leadership on the environment. For a decade, businesses had no certainty, no clarity and no incentive to deliver the investment and change that were solely required. The coalition failed to offer businesses the integrity, trust and transparency that Australia so badly needed and our environment so richly deserved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the so-called party of business got left behind by their own constituency. Businesses started to recognise the value of environmental protection. They assumed the mantle of the ESG agenda. They started to make significant improvements in each business's environmental record. They started to adopt plans to get to net zero and to report on their environmental impacts. Businesses were taking forward the agenda that the Liberal government was failing to take forward. Because businesses knew it was important to their employees, their shareholders, their customers and their suppliers, they knew that protecting the environment was a critical part of Australia's future, and critical to the success of their own business models. They received no leadership or support from those opposite, but they did it anyway, and they did it because they knew it was the right thing to do and because they knew that without it they would not have a strong business future of their own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the coalition have been left behind. They have been left behind on climate and left behind on environmental protection. The community's expectations have moved ahead. Businesses' actions have moved ahead. Investors and superannuation funds have moved ahead. All are creating new standards and new practices to preserve Australia's important and rich biodiversity and our planet's precious climate. All of this has been done in the absence of leadership, and now the Labor government is here to assume the mantle and support Australian businesses, people, and community groups to deliver the leadership, the certainty, the accountability and the trust so that all Australians know the direction in which we're heading, which is to preserve and protect our environment for future generations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I rise to join my colleagues in support of the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023, along with the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023. This is an important piece of environmental legislation. It reaffirms the Albanese Labor government's commitment to hitting pause on nine years of environmental mismanagement, although, frankly, to label the environmental record of those opposite as simply mismanagement is somewhat charitable. It implies ambivalence or apathy, rather than a wanton disregard for protecting Australia's flora and fauna.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting Australia's biodiverse ecosystems, which are as varied as they are precious, should be of great importance to governments of all persuasions. I note that we have not seen a great deal of change in those opposite on the environment from when they were in government—and the same can be said about many other areas of public policy. At least you can't blame them for being on brand and on message. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at those amongst the crossbenchers that have made contributions to this debate, particularly those Independents elected to this place, like me, at the most recent election. Almost by way of their presence in this place, I'd have thought the opposition might get the wake-up call they needed and realise that their old ways have caught up with them. I must say, though, that this bill doesn't concern itself with one seemingly threatened species from becoming extinct—that being the moderate Liberal. This bill does, however, take great strides in providing a means to protect Australia's fauna and their biodiverse habitats. Those opposite may not care about the biodiversity of Australian wildlife, but there might've been a glimmer of hope if it meant protecting the diversity of their party room.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is quite voluminous, with many moving parts. But, on the whole, through this bill, the Albanese Labor government is making it easier for people to invest in activities that help to repair nature, which would make the short title of the bill somewhat self-explanatory in the broader sense. When the Albanese Labor government took office, it inherited a report that had conveniently been held back from the public view, despite being delivered to the Morrison government months prior to the election. It wasn't just the convenient delay of the default market, offered by the member for Hume, nor was it to be the only surprise after the incoming Labor government fully appraised themselves of the true state of the budget that was left to them by the Morrison government. As I alluded to earlier, one of the big shocks to the system was the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment report</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be far easier just to say that those opposite either didn't know what they were doing in government or that they knew exactly what they were doing in government. In either case, it should not have been up to the environment minister under a Labor government to deliver a report that was handed to a Liberal-National government in 2021. Instead, the Minister for the Environment and Water, only six weeks into holding that office, fronted the National Press Club and gave a depressingly honest appraisal of what the state of Australia's environment was. It was one where we lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent throughout the globe. Threatened communities had gone up by 20 per cent and the Murray-Darling had fallen to its lowest level in 2019. I pause at that last figure and lament greatly. The health of the Murray River is the lifeblood to communities along the South Australia part of the basin. Sadly, under those opposite, their definition of cooperative federalism was to allow the former New South Wales government to do whatever they wanted at the expense of tomorrow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Tomorrow' is a very important word when it comes to this, when it comes to why our environment should be protected and safeguarded. We can't take the approach that protecting our environment is no longer our respective problem or that we have no responsibility to maintain it for future generations just because we may not be there to share it with them in hundreds of years time. Even without looking that far into the future, looking to the present, it is horrendous to turn a blind eye to the many communities that are on the spectrum between thriving and surviving due to the dollars that pour through to them through ecotourism. If Australia's pristine wildlife becomes merely a figment of yesteryear, many prospective tourists from abroad and even from across Australia will simply just Google what it used to look like rather than visit a desolate version of what once existed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, in part, why the Albanese Labor government has introduced this legislation before the parliament as part of its Nature Positive Plan, a plan that establishes the nature repair market, a marketplace where businesses, organisations, governments and philanthropic individuals work together to invest in projects that help to rewind the damage done to our natural environment—our many diverse pockets of nature that make Australia beautiful and special. A Nature Positive Plan was needed and the Nature Repair Market Bill delivers on this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill where all landholders, including our First Nations peoples, conservation groups and agricultural landholders, can participate. They can undertake a number of nature-positive projects either on land or on water—projects such as planting native flora or pest control. They all help to maintain the integrity of the biodiverse environment that occupies their land. As you might imagine, the completion of many projects that have been approved through the framework of this legislation will, in turn, create jobs and additional economic opportunities that are tethered to nature-positive actions and activities. Our First Nations peoples using their connection to the land to design, craft and participate in projects that provide economic dividends to their communities will be just another benefit of the nature repair market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has committed itself to protecting 30 per cent of our land and seas by 2030, a goal adopted by many nations through the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. It is a noble aim and one that I hope other nations are taking steps to achieve. But what do we do with our own natural environment? That is something that we do have an ability to impact positively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If maintaining our reputation as good international citizens and keeping many species of flora and fauna that are unique to Australia alive and not solely confined to a textbook are not enough, just look to the billions in financial flows that are waiting to be tapped into by those individuals that invest in restoring our environment and by the communities built around those ecosystems. The demand to do so may be silent on the other side of the chamber, but the Albanese Labor government is listening to the demand and establishing this market to meet that demand. This market will operate alongside the carbon market, as it will have the same regulator for probity and oversight, given the confidence in the current oversight by the Clean Energy Regulator on its current remit. This complementary regulatory oversight will also have additional benefits attached whereby carbon farming projects can also look to deliver positive outcomes for biodiversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The emerging markets, especially the nature repair market as it is to emerge upon this bill passing the parliament, are aided by a number of recommendations that were made by Professor Ian Chubb in the Independent Review of Australian Carbon Credit Units. It is important to ensure that there is a level of surety in the integrity of any market, as it better ensures a greater level of investment through these markets. Confidence in a market will ensure participation by a wider range of investors, and it stands to reason that, in doing so, we can achieve better environmental outcomes as a result. The biodiversity certificates that are created as part of the nature repair market provide integrity in them not just as an investment but also as reflecting a genuine net benefit to the environment. People invest for a number of reasons: on behalf of themselves, their companies, their funds or a number of other entities. But, one way or the other, they can have a great degree of surety that this new market has legitimacy and accomplishes positive outcomes that achieve, as the bill would entail, nature repair—a genuine nature repair at that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't about making people feel good about investing towards green environmental projects; it is about investments that are backed by a regulator with the power to monitor and enforce that projects are conducted in accordance with a strong degree of probity. Restoring accountability and trust is important. This is why a transparent scheme will be in place, with projects and certificates being made available on a public register and with further information being released by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This is so the parliament and the public at large can retain their confidence in the scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our environment, our natural heritage, isn't merely a treasure to be admired in an intangible or disconnected way, because many of us have a strong connection to our land. So many rely on us to make the right decisions in this place so they can grow up and start a family in a town their family has lived in for generations. Many rely on us to ensure that they still have an industry in an area that people want to visit because of its uniqueness and its natural beauty—something where viewing it in a photo or in a documentary isn't quite as magnificent as seeing the majesty of it with one's own eyes. Our environment is a natural asset of our nation. Not only must it be maintained for future generations—those of our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren—but we must also recognise that, if we do not take affirmative steps at maintaining and restoring our environment, we should care about maintaining it for our own generation, let alone those in the future.</span>

I do not want to have to talk to future generations about how beautiful the Great Barrier Reef was. Accepting this as an inevitability is purely defeatism, and it would be truly alarming to see that coming from our political leaders. We do not inhabit a chamber, nor a building, where the too-hard basket is a credible excuse for inaction on the big challenges that we face. We must do better.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the fact that the Great Barrier Reef, a natural wonder of the world, is in the backyard of the Leader of the Opposition, you'd think that he would set aside his template stances when it comes to action on the environment and instead appreciate the need to protect the ecosystems that feed out into the reef and to protect the reef itself. But the grim reality is the chance of that happening is a truly remote one. Maybe his new pair of glasses and the media of him holding puppies were just for show after all. It's the same Leader of the Opposition that we know all too well.</span>

In fact, let the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report be a wake-up call to us all, one that tells many what they already knew quite well. It is something that more need to be aware of in order to ensure that the Australian people know what is at stake, what the cost of inaction is, what we have to lose. We cannot throw our hands up and say that it's too late or things are too far gone.</span>

Some have larger patches than others, I must admit, but, big or small, these diverse ecosystems are worth protecting, and they're worth coming into this place to support measures that aim to repair and safeguard them.</span>

I say that particularly to the moderates on the other side of the chamber. If you're afraid of seeming woke in your party rooms by supporting a bill that is supporting our environment, there'll be plenty of teals eyeing you off come time for the next election. I'd encourage you to look at it as being one of those 'from the frying pan into the flames' moments. Then maybe your self-interest and instincts for survival might kick in to save the day. There are a lot of Australian flora and fauna that are hoping that your survival instincts will safeguard their survival moving forward. If that's not enough to convince those opposite, I'd encourage everyone just to close your eyes for a moment and just think of your happy place, a place where you, in nature, like to go to and relax with your family, by yourself, with your partner or with your dog. Imagine, when you open your eyes, that that place is no longer there. That's what this bill is here to safeguard and protect. That is the importance of this bill. That's why it is so important that we get this bill passed through this House, if not for me, for our children, for our grandchildren and for our great-grandchildren. I thank the House.</span>

                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023. Somewhere between Prime Minister John Howard and Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the Liberal Party and National Party stopped believing in markets. They once believed in taking action on climate change by pricing carbon. I listened carefully to those opposite, all the way through this debate, constantly railing against the concept of a market. These are the Liberal and National parties, who claim they're the parties of private enterprise and the market. But it's the Labor party who wants to take action on climate change through the safeguard mechanism. We did when we were last in government. The Labor Party, through this particular legislation before the chamber, is wanting to engage in nature repair through a market-based mechanism. But those opposite cannot bring themselves to believe in the market, which is a great irony for the party of Menzies, Fraser and Howard. The Liberal and National parties somehow cannot believe in the market and cannot believe in taking action to create a market, yet when they were in government previously, legislation not dissimilar to this was something they once believed in. They've had a sort of Damascus Road conversion experience in reverse on this particular legislation in the last 12 months or so, but on taking action on the environment and taking action on carbon pollution by using a market mechanism—somewhere in the last decade and a half they did it. They lost their faith in the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the Labor Party, the party of the collective and solidarity. We are the party of the market, and this particular legislation is taking action on the environment and nature repair using a market-based mechanism. For those who listen, when you hear the platitudes and the sermonising from those opposite about the market, look at what they actually do and how they actually vote, rather than what they say. Actions speak a lot louder than words when it comes to those opposite. The Albanese Labor government wants to make it easier for people to invest in activities that help repair nature. To that end this landmark legislation would create a national framework for a world-first, voluntary national biodiversity market. We want to protect our environment from destruction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite—having lost the election and sitting all those teals and Greens up there; having lost the election with seats held traditionally by the coalition, like Higgins and Bennelong, now held by Labor—still cannot bring themselves to accept the outcome and the lessons about taking action on the environment. Our ambition for nature is very big. Just as the Hawke government established Landcare, we want to restore environments that have been impacted in the past and repair more of what has been damaged. That's how we can build a truly nature-positive Australia where we leave our environment in a better state for our children and our grandchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want to live in a nature-positive country, a country that stops environmental decline and repairs nature—a country that prizes the Great Barrier Reef in my home state of Queensland, the beautiful rural areas in my electorate around the Somerset Dam and the Wivenhoe Dam and the rural areas around Ipswich. One of our government's most important priorities is to see new private initiative and private investment in our natural environment. We want to tap into that enterprise and creativity and harness them for the benefit of nature. We see enormous untapped potential here, and we are determined to help unleash it not in place of government action—Labor governments always take governmental action—but in addition to it, a partnership between governmental action and the private sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why with these bills we are legislating a world-first nature market, establishing the measurements, integrity and property rights necessary to properly reward the restoration and protection of biodiversity, working side by side with the carbon market. We want to support landholders to carry out activities that repair nature by establishing a world-leading nature repair market. In a world-first scheme, landowners will be able to be paid by a third party for protecting and restoring nature on their land. It will make it easier for businesses, philanthropists and others to invest in repairing nature across our great land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation establishes a scheme to incentivise private enterprise in nature restoration by creating tradeable certificates for projects that protect and restore biodiversity. This market forms part of our Nature Positive Plan to protect more of what's precious, repair more of what's damaged and manage nature better for the future. This new market could realise billions of dollars of investment, complementing the existing carbon credit scheme while improving our environment. Indeed, many people have talked about recent reports of $137 billion that this market could unlock to repair and protect Australia's environment by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The credits would be generated, for example, by supporting landholders, including farmers and First Nations communities, to do things like replant a vital stretch of koala habitat, revive a critical nature corridor, repair damaged riverbeds or remove invasive species. Examples of this include removing drainage ditches and excluding livestock and feral herbivores to restore a natural marsh, which would create critical habitat for diverse native frog, fish, turtle and wetland bird species. Indigenous rangers undertake great work in terms of feral animal exclusion, buffel grass removal, feral-cat control and cultural burning in the Central Desert. I've met Indigenous rangers all across the country, from the Kimberley to Maningrida in the Northern Territory, in Central Australia and in my home state of Queensland, and I see the great work they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The certificate generator for the project could support Indigenous rangers working on country for many years, restoring seagrass meadows permanently lost from historic poor water-catchment quality, providing habitat for sea turtles, dugongs, marine fish and seahorses. Monitoring can be provided by local commercial and recreational fishers who foresee increased local fish stocks. In my own community, three projects across Ipswich and Somerset recently received federal government koala community grants to support recovery and protection of koalas, including by improving habitat. I've had the pleasure of visiting two of these projects—the koala health and habitat rehabilitation project in the Esk/Somerset region, run by the Australian Earth Laws Alliance and Care4esk, and the Purga koala habitat restoration project being delivered by Forest Land Management. I'm really pleased to see the work and research being undertaken in relation to those koala corridors around Glen Rock in the Somerset region, and Purga and Peak Crossing around rural Ipswich. These projects involve tree planting, habitat revegetation and weed eradication in known koala habitats, so they would be likely to generate biodiversity credits under the scheme. I look forward to those opportunities in my local area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also a number of local Landcare organisations in my electorate across the Ipswich, Somerset and Karana Downs regions. For example, Bremer Catchment Association have worked tirelessly to restore the banks of the Bremer River in central Ipswich, Cribb Park and other areas. I've seen the work that has been done over the years around the Allawah Scouts place, and around Basin Pocket with people like Darren Close and others who have been working in the area to restore the land and the vegetation, and get rid of noxious weeds along the Bremer River. It's very important. I commend organisations like West Moreton Landcare, who have made considerable progress in rehabilitating waterways and environmental corridors, particularly in places like Rosewood. The Rosewood Scrub project and Mason's Gully restoration—right on the fringe of the urban areas in residential areas of Rosewood near Cabanda Home Care—are great places for people to go and walk, with a number of different species of plant that have been put back in that area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the work that has been done in terms of flood mitigation and restoration after the many floods and fires that have impacted the Ipswich and West Moreton region, including the Somerset region. I also thank West Moreton Landcare for the great work they've undertaken in the Brisbane Valley Rail Trail around places like Lowood. They've got considerable funds that I've been seeking support on. I also thank the Brisbane Valley Kilcoy Landcare group for working with me on vegetation issues and tree planting in the upper part of the Brisbane valley along the rail trail. They've also done some great work—they've been involved in rainforest restoration and the recovery of koalas, ecological communities and species in South-East Queensland, up around Jimna and the state forest in the northern bit of my electorate. These Landcare groups make a significant contribution to our local environment. It would be great to see their work recognised and captured by this nature repair market. I'm really excited about this, I think it is a great opportunity for those Landcare groups to partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'll mention some of the traditional owners from the Ipswich region, including Uncle Henry Thompson Jr, who runs a local business providing Indigenous land conservation services and traditional fire techniques. That's an opportunity I see for local First Nations people in the Ipswich region. In my electorate, about 5.5 per cent of our population is First Nations, so it's a growing part of the electorate. I think this will be terrific. I see a lot of synergies in the work that's been done together by people like Henry Thompson and the land care groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new market will be regulated by the Clean Energy Regulator. The regulator will have monitoring and enforcement powers to ensure projects are conducted in accordance with rules. It won't be willy-nilly open slather; there will be monitoring, reporting and notification of delivery of projects and activities on environmental outcomes. An independent committee will provide advice to the minister about the methods to set the rules for the projects. Creating a nature repair market with proper integrity and transparency will give business, philanthropists and local people interested a way to invest with confidence and will allow them to buy a quality product—verifiable, well-regulated certificates—so they can ensure their investments in protection and restoration have environmental benefits that are long lasting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market would include a public register of biodiversity certificates to track their status and ownership. These integrity measures will ensure that, if people are investing in repairing nature, they actually get the long-term benefits. We can't allow greenwashing. We see this in numerous projects that get government funding. We see from time to time that people put a flavour on things when it's not actually what is happening on the ground. We want to ensure that the benefits that are promised are realised. Let's be clear that, while nature credits will be available for companies, the need to offset unavoidable damage they cause to nature—for example, if they build mines or other developments—is not the point of the program in any way at all. It is not designed to be an offset scheme to give developers an opportunity to buy credits instead of protecting our natural environment. This is not an effort to make it easier to replace one bit of the natural environment with another bit of the natural environment. This is a way of getting additional private sector and philanthropic investment into nature, so we need to get the market design right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten years ago, the Australian Labor government created the world's first national legislative scheme for accrediting carbon offset projects. Today millions of dollars of these carbon credits are being traded each year, providing an extra income for farmers and landholders and lowering Australia's overall carbon emissions. Like all markets, it is an ongoing task to make sure the scheme is done with impeccable integrity. It's an important part of Australia's climate strategy and for our long-term path to zero emissions. The lesson is that well-designed, well-functioning environmental markets, including the use of offsets, can be a powerful force for good and not evil. In contrast, a bad market can be worse than no market if it's poorly designed, underregulated, creates perverse incentives or just greenwashes bad behaviour. These schemes need to be built on solid ground. That includes timing; we hope the new scheme will be operating by next year. That's why it's important that we pass the foundational legislation now to allow all of that work setting up the market and developing the methodologies to commence. It's part of what we need to do to protect, restore and repair nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that personally from my electorate. We have been hit by three major floods since 2011. There were bushfires around Linville and Moore, Bundamba and Ripley Valley. We've seen in my electorate the impact of the ravages of nature. I've seen what floods can do in communities and how they can destroy whole families' livelihoods and prospects. I've seen the impact on Lockyer Creek, the Bremer River, the Brisbane River and so many parts of my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so optimistic about this legislation. I fully support it and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I rise to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. I want to congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Water, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, for bringing this bill to this parliament. It's incredibly important, and she, in her short time as minister in this portfolio, has done a lot more in one year than that other side did in 10 long, sorry years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I live in a wonderful electorate. I represent the electorate of Cooper. It has many environmental and climate activist groups. We have the local chapter of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who sit with me in my office and have done so for many, many hours while we discuss important issues, like how to make the safeguard mechanism the best it can be, and I thank them for their hard work and the dedication they have to making sure that climate change is halted in its tracks and that there is a future for this planet. I want to thank the Australian Parents for Climate Action, a group of parents coming from many schools across my electorate, who visit me with their schoolchildren and talk to me about caring for the oceans and our forests and looking after the many animals and species that are facing extinction, They bring me lots of pictures, they bring me cakes, they bring me stories of their travels, and, to be honest, they bring me hope. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Friends of the Earth, an amazing organisation that recently have been talking to me about their concerns to make sure that in our transition to a clean energy economy we don't leave anyone behind—that there is a fair transition for workers. So they were very pleased to see that this Labor government has established the Net Zero Economy Agency and advisory board, led by the incredibly able Greg Combet, somebody I know very, very well from a previous life. And the Net Zero Authority will work with state and territory and local governments, with existing regional bodies, with unions, with industry, with investors and with First Nations groups to help key regions, industries, employers and others proactively manage the transformation to a clean energy economy, so that no-one is left behind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have activists who are very keen on electric vehicles and come and see me very often about the infrastructure that is needed to make sure electric vehicles are affordable and can be used by everyone. I have wonderful community battery groups who know how to run community batteries and have worked very closely with us on our community battery policy. I am very pleased to say that Alphington in my electorate will actually have a community battery. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have local groups and local people who form part of Extinction Rebellion, the true climate disruptors. Whilst many might question their tactics, no-one can question their passion and dedication to making sure that we have a clean energy future. We have the Tomorrow Movement, a group of wonderful young people in my electorate who come and meet with me often, and who sometimes stand out the front with placards and signs to make sure that the issue of climate action is not going away. It keeps me grounded and makes sure that I am accountable and responsible to them. There is the Youth Climate Coalition. We have the Darebin Climate Action Now group. These are an amazing group of people. They are leaders in our community—absolute leaders—who are dedicated to making sure that there is strong action on climate change from all levels of government—local, state and federal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of local government, the Darebin Council has actually declared a climate emergency. They were one of the first, if not the first, local governments to declare a climate emergency. I want to acknowledge the hard work of Trent McCarthy and Jane Moreton for instigating that movement, where hundreds of local governments now have declared climate emergency, as have, of course, the Labor Party and the Labor government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is my own climate and energy reference group, branch members of the Labor Party and local individuals who meet with me on a regular basis and make sure that I keep them up to date with advances on what the government is doing around climate action, and they give me very honest—and sometimes hard—feedback. But they are extremely glad to see that they finally have a government that is moving on climate action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to mention all the wonderful waterways groups, the Merri Creek groups, the Darebin Creek volunteers and management committees, the great people who work hard down at Edwardes Lake and on Edgar's Creek. These are amazing activists who have reclaimed our waterways from barren, polluted wastelands to gorgeous green urban areas, where we now have platypi. We have seen endangered native fish return to our waterways, amazing birdlife, including beautiful kingfishers, and now, thanks to the collaboration with First Nations rangers, we have had cultural burns along the Darebin Creek that have seen Indigenous grasses that have not been seen for decades re-emerge. We have many Friends of the Forest groups, especially the Newlands Friends of the Forest, and a big shout-out to the wonderful Cath Rouse, who took me on a trip to Toolangi state forest. I was lucky enough in the dark of the night to spot a greater glider. Now thanks to the Dan Andrews government, we know that those old forests will be protected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently my daughter, her husband and her two kids set off around this beautiful country—doing a lap, as they say—in their campervan. My grandchildren are learning about the environment first-hand, and through their home schooling they do bird spotting, they do researching of local flowers and plants, they draw animals and they are learning about endangered species. Right now they are in croc country and, I can tell you, they are learning about dangerous creatures. I want my grandchildren, Isla and Jack, to be able to grow up and do the same with their kids. So you see, for my electorate and my family, care of the environment and action on climate change are paramount issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is delivering with a huge suite of policies led by Minister Bowen and Minister Plibersek. The Nature Repair Bill sits in our environment policy framework that aims to protect and restore Australia's natural landscape. It is a market mechanism much like the CPRS—which we never managed to implement because of the Greens party, which voted against it, you will recall—and is much like ACCU and credit units in the Safeguard Mechanism, which have the support of the majority of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is making it easier for people to invest in activities to help repair nature. We want to leave nature better off for our kids and our grandkids. We are supporting landholders, including farmers and First Nations communities to do things like plant native species, repair riverbeds or remove invasive species, and we're making it easier for businesses and philanthropists to invest in these efforts. We need significant investment in conservation and restoration for a nature-positive future. Business and private sector investment can contribute to reversing environmental decline and, to be perfectly honest, they should. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces a world-leading voluntary market framework to support landholders in protecting and restoring nature. It will do a world of good after a decade of bad from the previous government, who did very little in this area. It will include a tradeable biodiversity certificate, assurance and compliance arrangements, a public register and a nationally consistent approach for measuring biodiversity outcomes. And it will mobilise private investment to protect, to manage and restore Australia's natural landscape. It will enable the Clean Energy Regulator to issue Australian landholders with tradeable biodiversity certificates for projects that protect, manage and restore nature. These certificates can then be sold to businesses, organisations, governments and individuals. The bill includes a wide range of provisions to ensure that these certificates will have integrity, so the market can invest with confidence, and so people who care so much about environment can be confident that people engaging in this market do not engage in green washing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has been drafted with a strong focus on integrity and transparency. The biodiversity integrity standards will support the making of project rules, and the nature repair market committee will advise the minister on methodology determinations with these standards. There will be transparency in the market, which will be achieved through the advice of a committee being made public. Projects being publicly tracked through the register and ownership of biodiversity certificates being listed on the register will be there for all to see. All landholders including First Nations people, conservation groups and farmers can participate in the market. Landholders can undertake projects that improve or protect existing habitat as well as projects to establish and restore habitat. These can be on land, waterways or in marine and coastal environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you see, the Labor government is absolutely committed to making sure that our environment is protected, not only for the wonderful burghers of my electorate in Cooper, who, as I mentioned, care so much about these issues but for my grandchildren, for their children and for future generations to come, and for our First Nations people as well to make sure that we respect the land as they have done for 60,000-odd years. This is an incredibly important bill. It's one that we must support. It's one that we cannot let slip by. It is there for the future of all to enjoy this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Borumba Pumped Hydro will cost at least $4 billion more than Snowy Hydro 2.0 is currently expected to cost for just 13 per cent of the output. For a massive $14.2 billion, we will get up to 24 hours of power out of Borumba, compared to Snowy Hydro 2.0, which even at its blown-out cost of about $10 billion will at least offer seven days of power. On these numbers alone, Borumba Pumped Hydro just does not stack up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This starts as one of the most expensive taxpayer funded renewable projects in Australia. The $14.2 billion figure pays only for the pumped hydro project. No figure has ever been released on the expected cost of the compulsory acquisitions of land for the transmission lines or the upgrades to the power station at Woolooga. We have not seen any detailed economic feasibility studies in relation to Borumba Pumped Hydro. Why are we told renewables are so cheap and nuclear is so expensive when, for the same $14.2 billion, we could build nearly three one-gigawatt small modular reactions for 24/7 dispatchable power. While Snowy 2.0 will be able to generate at its full 2,000 megawatt capacity for 175 hours, Borumba will be able to generate at full capacity 2,000 megawatt capacity for only 24.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Borumba is not expected to be built until 2029, yet the compulsory acquisition for transmission lines is beginning now, to link a project that may not even be subject to environmental approvals. By the time Borumba is expected to come online, in more than six years, how will technology have changed and progressed? Transmission towers of up to 500 kilovolts and up to 70 metres high atop 20 cubic metres of concrete foundations are proposed across more than 100 private properties between Borumba and Woolooga. Both the pumped hydro and the transmission lines will be built over a critically endangered subtropical Australian lowland rainforest and agricultural land used for grazing and small cropping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government refuses to disclose how much it is squandering on Borumba Pumped Hydro, presumably due to commercial-in-confidence issues. It committed in the budget to an undisclosed amount for Borumba Pumped Hydro. It will be built 13 kilometres from the town of Imbil, with between 54 and 83 kilometres of forest to be ripped up to link it, via Powerlink's pylon parasites, with the power station at Woolooga. Borumba Pumped Hydro and the planned transmission lines are to be built on a rural greenfield area that has never had industrial infrastructure. The farmers there help feed our nation. It's so scenic. It is a sought-out mountain bikers' and hikers' retreat. Now it will be forced to bear the brunt of this industrialisation to provide power for Brisbane, 180 kilometres away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This places an unfair burden on the bush, primarily on greenfield properties. Where is the audit on Crown land to find suitable places in the city to build these renewables, where transmission losses would be vastly less? The habitat of Brisbane is protected from intrusive renewables, while the habitat of platypuses, koalas and the northern quoll on freehold land is trashed for the development of pumped hydro and transmission lines. We are fighting for a Senate inquiry into the rollout of the high-voltage transmission lines across regional farmlands. For the fourth time, it was voted down 32-30, but we won't go away. What does the Labor Party have to hide? Why won't it let our communities have their say? Why won't those on the crossbench vote for the Senate inquiry?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  The Albanese Labor government understands that safe and affordable housing is crucial to the security and wellbeing of all Australians. That is why since we've come to office we've made many commitments and funded many things when it comes to housing and homelessness. We provided $67.5 million extra to the states and territories through our National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to help tackle homelessness. We assisted 1.1 million Australians with the rising cost of rent by increasing maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 15 per cent. We have widened the remit of the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, making up to $575 million available to invest immediately in social and affordable rental homes. We've given incentives to increase the supply of rental housing by improving arrangements for investments in build-to-rent accommodation and many, many more things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was so pleased over the weekend to see that we had announced that we were delivering more than $398 million to my home state of Queensland within the next two weeks to immediately begin boosting the social housing stock as part of the $2 billion Social Housing Fund Accelerator payment. This funding will be provided to states and territories within the next few weeks to deliver thousands of new social homes across Australia. Funding will be allocated on a per capita basis, with $50 million allocated to each jurisdiction as a minimum. We know it is really important to support this, and that's why we are creating thousands of homes for Australians on social housing waiting lists and increasing their housing supply sooner, with all funding committed to the states and territories. This continues the work of our new National Housing Accord, a shared ambition to build one million new homes over five years from 2024. It also builds on the work of the national cabinet on renters rights and planning reforms. We will continue to work with states and territories to address housing affordability, supply and homelessness.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $2 billion in additional funding brings the Albanese government's investment in homelessness funding to more than $9.5 billion in this financial year to 30 June. We know that Australians want practical solutions and we will work with the Palaszczuk Labor government in Queensland to get on with the job of delivering more social housing in Queensland. This is real dollars driving real change and building more homes for Australians. At every opportunity we have added to our already ambitious housing agenda. This significant new funding will help build more rental homes in Queensland and across my electorate of Blair, which is one of the fastest-growing regions in the country, and around Ipswich and the lower Somerset region—with places like Springfield and Ripley really topping the list of fast-growing areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, we could do more if the Senate stopped blocking our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund legislation—the biggest investment in social and affordable rental housing by a federal Labor government ever or by any government in the last decade. It's an absolute disgrace that those opposite and the Greens are teaming up to delay the legislation in the Senate. If they had any integrity on this issue, they would vote against it, frankly. It's up to them to explain why they don't support 30,000 desperately needed homes. To put this in perspective, every day of delay past 1 July is $1.3 million a day that we are not spending on social and affordable housing for Australians who need it today—and, for every six months, its $250 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Housing Australia Future Fund has been backed by key stakeholders, including housing experts, community housing providers, housing ministers across both sides of politics across the country, and numerous crossbenchers across the parliament. Organisations like the National Shelter and the Community Housing Industry Association have urged the Greens to support the bill this week. I have no faith in those opposite, because they fundamentally and ideological do not support social and community housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel I worked closely with CHIA and veterans support organisations on Labor's veteran housing and homelessness policy. This involved $30 million from the Housing Australia Future Fund for emergency housing and services for veterans experiencing homelessness. I was pleased to hear in question time today the minister talking about what that would provide. Great organisations like Camp Andrew Russell in South Australia and other organisations in Queensland could be provided with that funding, but for those opposite and the Greens political party, who are delaying this legislation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a broad housing agenda and we are getting on with the job. We're not letting those opposite frustrate us. On the weekend we saw the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator announcement, and we are going to deliver thousands of new social rental homes across our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Highway 1, as I hope everyone knows, circumnavigates continental Australia and, indeed, it runs through my electorate, which is an inner metropolitan seat of Adelaide. I'm not sure, I haven't done research as to whether any of the other major capitals have Highway 1 running through the suburbs like we have in Adelaide, but suffice to say I'm very committed to changing that. In particular, I'm committed to changing the fact that it is the principal freight route for heavy vehicles that at the moment come down through the Adelaide Hills to the famous tollgate, which in many ways is seen as part of the city limits of Adelaide in my electorate—in fact, it's the corner of my electorate and the electorates of the member for Mayo and the member for Boothby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment those heavy vehicles run on Highway 1, which we also call Portrush Road for the section that runs through my electorate, from the tollgate at the Cross Road-Glen Osmond Road-Portrush Road intersection all the way down Portrush Road through my electorate and up through the northern suburbs to a destination that might be Port Adelaide or it might invariably be somewhere around the industrial capability of the north of Adelaide. It's dangerous and unnecessary and we need a different route, a more preferred route for heavy road freight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition in particular have always been very committed to rerouting that heavy freight around the back of the Adelaide Hills, around Monarto. This would leave the current freeway that carries commuter traffic down into Adelaide, instead taking that heavy freight around the back of the Adelaide Hills so that it can go either to the port, perhaps, or maybe all the way to Perth. Who knows what the various freight destinations are for the hundreds of thousands of vehicles that use that corridor. It's not appropriate that it moves through suburban Adelaide. We are very committed to this and very concerned that it is not a priority of the Labor government, both here in Canberra and the Malinauskas Labor government in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next piece of the puzzle is known as the Truro Bypass. That's on pause as part of this infrastructure review that the minister is undertaking. It frightens me and it frightens my constituents that there's a chance our dream of getting this dangerous heavy freight out of our suburbs—along that corridor there are schools, there are shops, there are residential homes. I myself live within 100 metres of Highway 1. We hoped and thought that this government might be favourably disposed to investing in that corridor. It wouldn't benefit just my electorate—far from it. There are many electorates in metropolitan Adelaide that would benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The greater fear is that the North-South Corridor, which is being invested in and which both sides of politics have committed to at state and federal levels, could in fact see Highway 1 permanently diverted down Cross Road to connect to the North-South Motorway. While I'm passionate about getting trucks off Portrush Road, I don't want to move them off one suburban stretch of road to see them go onto another one. Indeed, Cross Road is my southern boundary. At times, during previous elections, Labor Party candidates and Labor Party shadow ministers made certain glib promises and overarching motherhood statements about a commitment towards this. Regrettably, the reality is that the recent state budget in South Australia and the recent federal budget has seen no commitment to this vision whatsoever. To me, that means my constituents and many in the parts of suburban Adelaide that are affected by this heavy freight should deduce that we are not going to see action on this from the federal or state Labor governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The silver lining is to vote Liberal, because in the Liberal Party we are absolutely committed to this investment. Adelaide is being ignored by this government. There were no significant new infrastructure announcements in the recent budget. All we've heard is that existing projects we thought were going ahead, like the Truro Bypass, are now under review. The solution is to turn to a party that is committed to investing in serious, strategic infrastructure outcomes for our state and the safety of suburban Adelaide. I am committed to getting those dangerous heavy trucks out of the suburbs of Sturt.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Some in this place will recall me speaking in February 2020, at the end of the Black Summer fires, when communities like mine were reeling. At the time, there were urgent needs we called on the government to support. In addition, many of us recognised that longer-term investment was required not only to give hope to communities as they started the very long journey to recover but to make our vulnerable places better equipped to deal with the inevitable next bushfire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I stood in parliament calling for this sort of funding, never could I have imagined how the Mount Wilson Rural Fire Service brigade members could have made their joint federal-state grant of just under $700,000 go so far. Nor could I have imagined that the people who'd fought fire for many months and struggled with the devastation that the Gospers Mountain fire caused would have had the energy not only to fill in grant proposals but to make sure this project was the best possible outcome for the communities of Mount Wilson, Mount Irvine and their surrounds. Thanks to the additional fundraising efforts of the brigade, the shed we officially opened on Sunday can serve as a operations centre, with improved communications with headquarters—whichever headquarters that might be and wherever it might be—during any fire emergency. Out of something horrific, a practical purpose-built extension to what started out as a humble double garage with roller doors in the 1950s has been created. President Joe Montano, captain Beth Raines and the committee that's worked alongside them deserve the community's praise. It was very fitting that longstanding retiring deputy captain Barry Freeman got to do the honours of officially declaring the shed open.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 2,500 homes and businesses in Macquarie can now order uncapped satellite broadband services on Sky Muster. I know most people won't be aware of the failures of the Sky Muster satellite service in its reliability, availability of data access and speeds, but the arrival of the privately owned Starlink really highlighted how second-rate the NBN service that the previous government provided was. It affects mainly homes in the Hawkesbury but also parts of the mountains like the Megalong. Having urged for improvements in satellite services for many years, particularly during the pandemic when people had no choice but to work from home, I am very pleased that under Labor we're seeing improvements. After a successful trial, the new NBN Sky Muster Plus Premium service gives customers unmetered data 24 hours a day and faster speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. The unmetered service is possible because of the Albanese government's $480 million investment to upgrade the NBN fixed-wireless services. That's moved about 120,000 premises from satellite to fixed wireless, freeing up capacity on Sky Muster. The trials of the Sky Muster Plus Premium showed big improvements in user satisfaction, and I hope we see the same in the rollout. Across the NBN networks, including fixed-wireless and fixed-line networks, we're improving the NBN to give Australians access to the 21st century technology they really need and deserve. That includes the $2.4 billion to expand full-fibre NBN, which will benefit many fibre-to-the-node users in the mid-to-upper mountains and across the Hawkesbury in the coming months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to see the renewed relationship between local government and the federal government, with the first formal meeting in a decade of the local government council. I've had really positive feedback from some of the attendees of last week's meeting, including Hawkesbury councillor Mary Lyons-Buckett and Blue Mountains deputy mayor Romola Hollywood. We channel millions of dollars through councils to repair and improve roads and upgrade infrastructure not just in times of crisis. I'm particularly pleased with the new $100 million fund to help councils improve their energy efficiency, and they tell me they're pretty pleased too. Because it's co-funded, this has the potential to unlock over $200 million in high-impact energy upgrades to save community facilities on bills over the medium to long term. I know the Blue Mountains mayor, Mark Greenhill, is excited at the opportunity. Their council has adopted a net zero emissions from operations by the end of 2025, and Hawkesbury Council has net zero by 2030 or earlier. I know Councillor Daniel Wheeler, who was here, thinks this could make a really big difference.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I've always been a strong and vocal supporter of Tasmania's and, indeed, the nation's world-class sustainable forestry industry. Forestry is the art and science of growing, managing, using and caring for our forests. Nowhere in the world is this done better than in Australia. It's an industry that's good for the economy, it's good for jobs and it's good for the habitat that call our native forests home. It allows the broader community to prosper and to connect, whether that's through the honey industry, for instance, tourism businesses or individual recreational pursuits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this vital industry is under imminent threat. The recent decision by the Victorian government to accelerate the cessation of selective and sustainable native forest harvesting is making the broader industry extremely nervous. The motivation appears to be nothing more than waving the white flag to militant environmentalists. There are no winners in this ill-conceived decision, although, on the face of it, Victoria's decision to end native forest harvesting would appear to be a win for the environment. I believe in my heart of hearts that this is naive, and it will, of course, have unintended consequences. I admit that the changes facing our forests are complex, but they will not be solved by having a mass exodus of our forest management specialists, their expertise, their knowledge and, indeed, their equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ongoing effective management of our forests is absolutely crucial, and this management should be based on three things if it is to be effective. Firstly, we need a better understanding of traditional knowledge and practices of our First Nations people in the forestry industry. Secondly, decisions need to be based on science and facts. Finally, we need to harvest the lived experience of the people who have dedicated their lives to this evidence based care of our forests. I therefore join with the Australian Forest Products Association, AFPA, and say that we need a coordinated national plan, and we need it urgently. Our dependence on imported product is growing, while our sovereign capability simultaneously shrinks. We cannot allow this to happen. Stopping native forestry in one state is one thing, but what often happens and what will happen now is we'll simply import it from another one. All it does is significantly add to our $5½ billion worth of exports that comes predominantly from developing nations around the world with lesser environmental standards than our own. This is not a solution. It will neither preserve Australian forests nor holt global deforestation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easy to get entrapped by the emotional rhetoric of militant environmentalists. Older Tasmanians will still remember the devastation of the Labor-Green Tasmanian forest agreement, the peace deal. This devastated every two out of three jobs in regional towns. Towns were devastated. These are the facts of the Tasmanian world-class forest, and these are undisputed: Tasmania has a total land mass of 6.81 million hectares; 3.5 million hectares, or 49 per cent of that, is forested; and 53 per cent of all Tasmania's forests and 58.2 per cent of Tasmania's native forests are protected in reserves. This includes 87 per cent of Tasmania's old-growth forests. These forests are diverse in their nature. They provide habitat for plants and animals, offer recreational spaces, produce essential forestry products and provide employment opportunities and sustainable living for regional communities. Tasmania has one of the highest percentages of protected forests of any jurisdiction by size in the world. Ninety-nine per cent of Tasmania's high-quality wilderness areas on public land are protected, and over 85 per cent of our old growth forests are protected. Native forestry in Tasmania is sustainable. It provides timber to build houses and fibre for plastic-free furniture and is the lifeblood of local communities, providing important jobs in regions right across the electorate of Braddon. With the world's increasing demand for sustainable wood and fibre, Tasmania is in the box seat to leverage from this demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victoria's decision to shut down native forestry did not meet any of these factors. For the sake of our sovereign capability, our environment and local jobs, I ask the federal government to support our crucial native forestry industry, particularly in the great state of Tasmania.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  After the conclusion of the sitting week last week, some of us remained in parliament. Some had business with their respective parliamentary committees. In the other place, the sitting week continued into the early hours of Saturday morning. Some were still here for the conclusion of the Australian Local Government Association's National General Assembly, where I was glad to meet with local government representatives from my electorate of Spence, such as Mayor Karen Redman and Henry Inat of the Town of Gawler Council and Mayor Glenn Docherty and Councillors Misty Norris and Gay Smallwood-Smith from the City of Playford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many members were able to use the Friday to go back to their electorates and make the most of having a precious weekday at home in amongst this winter session. On Friday morning, I was joined in Spence by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It was an auspicious occasion for the minister to come down to Spence and pay us a visit. The minister is no stranger to my electorate of Spence. We were pleased to have him in Spence late last year to speak with representatives from a large number of veterans groups at the Salisbury Hotel, along with South Australia's Minister for Veterans Affairs, Geoff Brock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week's visit by the minister was all the more auspicious due to the fact that the visit brings the Northern Adelaide veterans and families hub one step closer to fruition. This was an initiative that began prior to my election as the member for Spence, starting back in March last year with a commitment from an incoming Labor government to establish a veterans and families hub in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. There are thousands of veterans living in my electorate of Spence who are counting on initiatives such as this to bring about positive outcomes when times are tough. I know I have done so many times since, but I again thank the member for Blair for his assistance, as the shadow minister for veterans' affairs at the time, in getting this project to materialise, from a mere proof of concept to something that I am here today to discuss in this chamber. There are just over 6,000 veterans within the electorate of Spence, and that number climbs to nearly 11,000 when including those from nearby electorates that border Spence, such as Barker, Grey, Mayo and Makin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Spence also houses a vast number of ADF personnel, many of whom serve at RAAF Base Edinburgh. A number may reside there temporarily, but many do so in the medium- to long-term, with a number choosing to continue living in the area after the conclusion of their service. This is in large part a contributing factor to our having such a well populated veterans group operating within Spence and the local surrounds—a huge diversity with a number of views, but with the shared goal of protecting our brave men and women who serve our nation when they come home to their families and try to lead a mundane life, an ordinary life, a civilian life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an inconvenient truth that many veterans and current serving ADF personnel struggle with their mental health and with day-to-day life. For many veterans this can be as a direct result of their service, and for many veterans it comes about when trying to transition into civilian life. Some who have served may say they aren't struggling, or they may not say so openly, but, given the time and a bit of trust, they will tell you about the battles that some of the mates they served with have fought and continue to fight. Often these battles are waged for many years after the conclusion of their proud service to their country. To that end, there is no surprise at the sheer multitude of veterans, veteran support groups, RSLs and families and advocates of veterans that have liaised with me throughout this process. Many have been here from the start, all the way through to the night I mentioned earlier, when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs met with our veteran community at the Salisbury Hotel in October last year and then refined those ideas further at a roundtable that I held in Gawler in November last year. I am glad so many have stuck by me and stuck by the Albanese government's commitment to veterans and persevered through this process to ensure we have the best chance of getting the veterans and families hub right. We all have a vested interest in getting this right, and we all know that there is so much at stake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I look forward to seeing the vision that Lives Lived Well and the Legacy Club in Adelaide have for the hub. I can't wait to play my small part in making a positive difference in the lives of veterans in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. On a final note, I'd like to thank all serving personnel and former personnel for their service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I refer to an article by Chris Kenny in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend Australian</span> where he bemoans the toxicity of politics and the careless response from the press, to his despair—to mine, too. It's nothing we haven't seen before. It's to the point where, after a debate in the House on travel rorts, a member attempted to take his own life whilst I was a member here. It caused huge disruption and upset to both sides of the House, including right across the political parties. The debate can come to such a point that someone is affected in such a matter. Politics is hard and difficult. It's rough. People make decisions about what they do and when they do it. Sometimes those decisions come back to bite. That was the case last week on both sides. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been in this House a long time, and I've heard a lot about renewable energy and how it's our saving grace, yet the technology we have today cannot take us to net zero by 2050 unless there are major breakthroughs. I hope that that would be the case. Kenny says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are constantly told by Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen … that renewable energy is the cheapest form of electricity that will provide reliable and affordable supplies into the future. Yet this deceit is not interrogated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're allowed to say these things, and no-one comes back to question. He mentions the vaccines here as well, and they weren't questioned by anybody. This is a lack, not only on our part as politicians, of questioning. That's our role: to question policy. You don't have to be on Sky News or anywhere else, but you do have to question. It's my farmers that have to deal with these increased costs of electricity, but it's gone on for me since the day I walked into the House. We need a break from toxicity.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I rise today to give a well-deserved shout-out to Shire of Leonora chief executive officer Jim Epis, who is retiring after 45 years of distinguished service to the Northern Goldfields region of O'Connor. Jim's career with the Shire of Leonora started way back in 1978, driving a grader on the shire's outside works crew. Within two years, he had been raised to the position of junior clerk, and after 14 years of building his knowledge of the machinations of local government, he was appointed deputy CEO in 1995. Twelve months later, he became the CEO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim has given a lifetime of dedicated service to his shire, so it was my absolute honour to give a speech at his recent retirement bash. I joined a long line of friends, family, colleagues and politicians, past and present, singing the praises of 'Gentleman Jim'—a huge character but also a humble, quiet achiever, whose Leonora legacy will endure for generations to come. In 1996, when Jim became CEO, a community survey was conducted to identify priority projects that would enhance the livability and functionality of the shire. Of the 48 projects originally nominated, 35 have been completed under Jim's watch, with six others underway, including an aged-care facility, sewerage infill program, heavy vehicle bypass and increased housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of those who may never visit Leonora, picture a lovingly restored and maintained historic Goldfields town that also supports the extraction of billions of dollars of resources mined in the surrounding shire. Leonora's main street features historic buildings and facades, shaded parking and recreational areas, public ablutions, and a community nature playground. Tower Street also serves as the running track for one of Australia's richest foot races, the annual Leonora gift, and it's the finish line for the annual Goldfields Cyclassic bike race hosted by the shires of Leonora and Menzies. On the outskirts of town lie the historic Gwalia Ghost Town, Museum and Hoover House, towered over by the Gwalia mine headframe, the oldest timber headframe in Australia. This headframe underwent a massive $1 million upgrade funded by the previous government under Jim's careful watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been my absolute pleasure to work with Jim for almost 10 years and see him deliver so many federally funded projects and programs. For me, the most significant will always be the introduction of the cashless debit card trial, which was initiated by a teen suicide crisis in Leonora. Jim's passion for his community drove the ensuing consultations, card implementation, reviews and endless critiques by those who will never set foot in Leonora or experience the social dysfunction that he has witnessed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim, you're an absolute champion of your Leonora community and you are more deserving of the JG Epis Community Centre named in your honour. I wish you and Margot a long and happy retirement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  The people of Hasluck voted for change a year ago, and one of the reasons they voted for change is that they want to see Australia embrace the green energy future. They knew that the coalition were never going to get there. The recent Guardian Essential poll suggests that voters realise that Labor is the better economic manager too. We have managed to deliver much needed energy price relief at a time when it is most crucial. Back in December, we were willing to place the cap on gas prices, which the coalition opposed. That action taken then has ameliorated the prices paid by consumers and businesses now, and the RBA noted that it had an anti-inflationary effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where would prices be now if those opposite were in power? Where would inflation be? Higher. That's where. This realisation has obviously permeated through to the community too, because voters know that as tough as things are right now they would be much worse under a Dutton government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the May budget, Labor went further, delivering the Energy Price Relief Plan with $1.5 billion over two years to eligible households and businesses, which, along with the efforts by mostly Labor states, will go a long way to providing much needed relief to those who most need it and, again, in an anti-inflationary manner. This is the short-term. But the government also has plans for the long-term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hasluck, like the whole of the south-west of Australia, is experiencing a drying climate due to climate change. The Albanese government has taken up the challenge, so long disbelieved and otherwise avoided by the conservative parties, and has embarked on ambitious and meaningful reform. We've enshrined emissions targets in law and passed the safeguard mechanism changes. We have invested in renewables and are building a regulatory framework to support our transition to a green energy economy. The budget provides for $2 billion in hydrogen investment to decarbonise our heavy industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, I visited Green Homes Australia's nine-plus star-rated display home in Brabham with Minister McAllister, because taking real, effective climate change action requires us to make changes at every level. As well, in Hasluck, Stratton will soon have a community battery, allowing residents to better utilise their renewable energy. And, in Midland, Labor is delivering to ensure we have the skills needed for the green energy transition. Fee-free TAFE is enhancing enrolments both at Midland and in VET in schools. With over 13,000 enrolments in fee-free courses across the state in semester 1 and $3.24 million for the development of a renewable training hub at Midland TAFE, which I visited with Minister O'Connor in February, there has, quite seriously, never been a better time to get into training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've long been a leader in the adoption of renewables at a community level, and now we have a government that is willing to lead. Renewables are the cheapest form of energy and will insulate us from global shocks, like the ones we're currently experiencing.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  Most women look forward to the birth of their baby with feelings of anticipation and excitement, but for many women in the wider Gladstone region this excitement was tempered with feelings of anxiety and fear when the Gladstone hospital maternity ward was put on bypass on 8 July 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After almost a year since the Gladstone Hospital maternity ward was put on bypass, the Central Queensland Hospital and Health Service has announced the reintroduction of the usual full-birthing services at the Gladstone Hospital from 3 June. At phase 3, all expectant mothers with low-risk pregnancies being 37 weeks or more gestation can give birth closer to home at the Gladstone Hospital. High-risk pregnancies will be referred to Rockhampton, as has previously been the case. The high-risk pregnancies have always been referred to tertiary hospitals, and this outcome will continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This announcement is long overdue after countless meetings, community forums, media events, ministerial representations and speeches in parliament. My sincere thanks goes to Jemma from Save Gladstone Maternity Ward and the Gladstone community for their continued advocacy in the restoration of these services. As a community, we have banded together for the services the region needs, and, let me be clear, without advocates such as Jemma this bypass may have extended longer than necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I released a petition, on 18 August 2022, drawing attention to the decline in the availability of maternity and other medical services at Gladstone and the negative impact this has had on the wider Gladstone region. The petition called on the Queensland Premier and the Minister for Health to provide adequate funding and resources and qualified medical professionals at the Gladstone Hospital to deliver maternity and other medical services. This petition received mass support across the region, with over 3,000 people signing the petition. Almost a year on, I'm pleased that the bypass has ended, so thank you to the Gladstone community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all feel relieved the bypass has ended, there must be a commitment that the maternity services are here to stay in the Gladstone region. The Queensland government must explain what the plan will be to implement and retain obstetricians and attract more health professionals to the region to maintain these health services. We also need to see the Biloela hospital maternity ward reinstated. It's been placed on bypass since August 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to conclude by emphasising that Australia is a prosperous nation. Giving birth in your local hospital should not be a given right for women in metropolitan areas only. It should also be the right of everybody in regional and rural Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  There are many Australians who selflessly volunteer their time, experience and talents to our community and do not seek thanks nor recognition for what they do. I rise today, on behalf of my community in the electorate of Pearce in Western Australia, to express a huge collective thankyou to these individuals who improve the lives of others. Four residents of Pearce were recognised in the 2023 King's Birthday Honours list—a remarkable achievement. His Excellency the Hon. David Hurley, the Governor-General, announced the recipients.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Order of Australia medal was awarded to three recipients in my community. Dr Mi Lee OAM was recognised for service to education, public health and the Korean community. Dr Lee was involved in developing national nutritional policies and dietary guidelines in Australia, held various positions at the Korean Academy of Scientists and Engineers in Australasia and the Nutrition Society of Australia and is a senior lecturer. Recognised for his outstanding service to cricket was Mr Toby Morell OAM. Mr Morell has been instrumental in many local cricket clubs, including the Quinns Rocks Junior, Joondalup Districts and Wanneroo Districts clubs. I have seen for myself how Toby involves himself within the sporting community, and I have seen the tears of pride well up in his eyes as he sees the proud smiles of recipients at award presentations, especially those of children and their parents. Also recognised, for his amazing service to motor sport, is Mr Edwin Taylor OAM. Mr Taylor has won many speedway championships and was proudly inducted into the Motorcycling Western Australia Hall of Fame. I have seen Edwin's concentration, experience and precision, and I have also had the joy to see how much he enjoys his riding.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr David Etherton PSM was awarded the Public Service Medal for outstanding public service in the coordination of support for the sporting, entertainment and creative industries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A summary of why Mr Etherton was recognised noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As Chief Executive Officer of VenuesWest, Mr Etherton saw first-hand the economic and community impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responded promptly and effectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He led the cross-government taskforce that established the $159 million COVID-19 Relief Fund. Recognising an opportunity to help the broader community and reduce food waste, Mr Etherton coordinated and led an initiative to use kitchens at Optus stadium, staffed by chefs from VenuesWest, Optus stadium and the RAC arena. In extremely complex and challenging circumstances, he leveraged his role for the benefit of the Western Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased and very proud to acknowledge the wonderful contributions of these four very community-minded locals by signing a letter of congratulations from Parliament House. We applaud their unwavering dedication, and we thank each and every one of them for their community service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  This weekend I went to Old Parliament House with my kids. In one exhibition, visitors can share their thoughts and reflections on democracy, and a small green post-it note caught my eye. It was a message from Ash, a 16-year-old. They wrote: 'Politicians should be aware of how they communicate with each another. You're representing Australia! You're also role modelling to younger Australians!' Those last two sentences carried exclamation points to emphasise Ash's passion, and the words struck a chord with me at the end of a very difficult week. Every workplace in Australia should be a safe workplace for women. We know parliament is not safe; nor are many workplaces around the country. Last week was a reminder of the challenges, the risks and the violence that so many women face in the community and that this is still present in this place, despite the change of government last year. But at the end of a difficult and distressing week for many, it's also worth reflecting on the amazing people who are working on reducing sexual violence both here and around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I'd like to pay tribute to With You We Can. This is a national online resource, demystifying the police and legal systems for victims of sexual violence while still working to improve those systems. We know how hard it is for women to come forward after having experienced sexual violence. This website makes it easier. I want to honour Sarah Rosenberg, one of the its founders, who has turned her own lived experience into help for others. For those who've experienced sexual violence or are supporting others, there are resources there to make that difficult job easier.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I want to acknowledge the people who are doing amazing work in increasing the representation of women in the corridors of power, both here and around the country, because that is also critical to changing the culture of sexual violence in this country. Last week the Parliamentary Friends of Women for Election met, and the group heard from Licia Heath, who runs the non-partisan Women for Election Australia, which seeks to achieve gender parity in Australian parliaments. Licia reminded us that we still have some way to go, with women making up only 37 per cent of state and territory parliamentarians, but she also acknowledged how far this parliament, in particular, has come, with women making up 46 per cent of Commonwealth parliamentarians. That is an increase of almost 10 per cent in just one election—from 36 per cent to 46 per cent. It is huge growth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to change the culture of this place and of the country, we need to elect more women across the board. I have the honour of sitting on the crossbench, which is a hive of strong, capable women standing up for the community and shifting the balance of parliament to be more representative of this country. In a week that was genuinely tough, this realisation gives me comfort and strength. While we still face challenges, we are making progress and we will continue to make progress. With the wonderful work of organisations like the ones I've just mentioned, we can make this country better than it already is.</span>

The awards celebrate Muswellbrook's wonderful businesses and individuals and recognise the amazing food, products and services that they provide for the Muswellbrook community. Muswellbrook is a small town, but it's packed with amazing businesses that would show up any others in the country.</span>

Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, it has everything a great pub needs—good food and cold beer! I can see why they won this award. Blackrock Industries were highly commended in this category. Well done to Steve Fordham, who does so much for his community and for Indigenous Australians in general. Good on you, mate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local radio is important in communities like Muswellbrook. I also enjoy listening to the local radio station, Hunter Valley AM 981, 2NM, as I drive around the electorate. Their recognition in winning the Making Muswellbrook award is well deserved. Congratulations to the team!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tourism is an area that is always growing in the Hunter. That's because of businesses like Hunter Belle Cheese Room, which won the category Excellence in Tourism. Highly commended was GJ's By The Lake. Congratulations to Hunter Belle, which also took out the top prize for Business of the Year. I cannot wait to come and try some more cheese again soon.</span>

Fourteen months ago, when he was Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister made some promises that life would be cheaper under him, under the Labor Party. This was shared in a headline in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> on 22 May 2022. He also promised at the national Labor campaign launch in 2022 that mortgage repayments would be cheaper under him, and on 97 occasions he promised to lower electricity bills by $275. Clearly, on every single one of those promises he has failed miserably, and so has the Labor government. They were clear KPIs, key performance indicators, from the Prime Minister: life would be cheaper under him, mortgage repayments would be reduced, electricity costs would be lower by $275.</span>

In March it was revealed that there are over a thousand locals in Wyndham Vale who are homeless and living rough. This is according to census data. So you can imagine, Madam Deputy Speaker, how pleased I was on the weekend to attend the Victorian Labor State Conference and hear the Prime Minister announce the new $2 billion social housing accelerator to deliver thousands of new homes across Australia. In those nine years of being here under a Liberal government it was incredibly frustrating to watch while they cut funding to community organisations that supported homeless people in my electorate. It was heartbreaking to sit with people who had fallen into homelessness and hear their stories of how difficult it was to get their lives back on track. So I am incredibly proud of this policy, which is just one part of how the Albanese Labor government is creating secure homes and giving more Australians a foundation for a better future. Already, the Home Guarantee Scheme has helped over 1,200 locals from the electorate of Lalor into homeownership, and in the budget we expanded that eligibility.</span>

The $2 billion announced on Saturday, to be provided to the states via agreement within two weeks, goes some way to taking some of the urgency out of this. But remember, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have to build or buy these homes. We need the HAFF passed this week in the Senate. It is the last sitting week before we go on winter break, and the tents are up around the Werribee River, where people are living rough through this winter. I want to be sure that next winter they're in houses. I call on those senators from the Greens and the Liberals who are blocking this legislation to pass this. I've seen the shocking impact on local families. I've spoken to mums with five kids sleeping in cars over the Christmas holidays. Those in the Senate need to get this passed. They need to do it now. Every day we waste. We go away for another winter break, and then next winter there will still be tents on the Werribee River. I call on those opposite and the Greens to do what needs to be done. Support this legislation and let us get on with the job.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fair to say that the arts did not thrive under the former government, who failed to recognise their true value. They saw them as a charity case, an indulgence or sometimes a punching bag when it served their political agenda. The Albanese government takes a different approach. We recognise the value of art for art's sake but also acknowledge that the arts deliver benefits far beyond the arts community itself. We recognise that the arts make a tangible and valuable contribution in areas like education, health, mental health, the environment, foreign affairs and trade, tourism and regional development, and in issues affecting First Nations Australians. Our new national cultural policy, Revive, acknowledges this, and we will play a national leadership role in fostering collaboration across portfolios and coordination between all levels of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start with education. This weekend, I saw Winmalee High School's production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Matilda</span>. Even if Max Jackson, who plays the unlikeable Mr Wormwood, hadn't name-checked me in the song 'Telly', which argues that you learn more from television than you do from books, it's clear how much richness, joy and pride students, parents and teachers get from being involved in school musicals. But it ignores the growth that also occurs during the process—the lessons in collaboration, in hard work and in the sense that something that typically seems a local mess to start with can, with determination and persistence, become an amazing performance, as it was on Saturday night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's no surprise that we see an important role for education as part of our support for the arts, and vice versa. One example is that we're providing $2.6 million to support specialist in-school arts education programs, particularly for areas of identified disadvantage. We're providing the funding for the Australian Youth Orchestra's national music teacher mentoring program to help generalist teachers enrich music education practice in their classrooms. We're also supporting 60 primary schools around Australia to teach local First Nations languages and cultural knowledge in those schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the arts reaches across many other portfolios, and under Revive, in health and mental health, there's recognition of the intersection of the two. We're providing pilot funding of $4.2 million to support access to art and music therapy programs and generate valuable data on the broader community impacts of that and the demand for those services. In other portfolio areas, there's funding for health related arts programs. For example, through the Veteran Wellbeing Grants program, the Penrith based Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Australia has received $98,000 for a program called Guitars for Vets, a community based music and wellbeing program I'm looking forward to seeing rolled out in my neighbouring electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we turn to the environment, we recognise that the two, arts and environment, are really closely linked. One of the initiatives in Revive is to establish artist residencies to visit to World Heritage sites in Australia to produce artworks that help share the intrinsic value of Australia's natural and built heritage. We know the power of the arts to attract tourists, and our new funding of landmark cultural spaces like the National Aboriginal Art Gallery in Alice Springs and the Aboriginal Cultural Centre in Perth will stimulate domestic and international tourism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited many disability services as Special Envoy for the Arts, where the making of art, whether it's visual arts or drama, movement and filmmaking, like at Bindi and Incite in Alice Springs, brings many benefits to participants and their families. Last month the Department of Social Services announced more than $1 million in funding for arts projects to support young people aged 12 to 18 years, people with disability, people with mental health issues, vulnerable women and unemployed people, including things like Big hART for First Nations youth in outback Western Australia, Circus Nexus across Melbourne, and Bus Stop Films in Sydney and the Illawarra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what a whole-of-government commitment to creative endeavour looks like, and it's encouraging to see funding flow towards arts projects in this way. The Albanese government doesn't see the arts as an optional extra, as something that you tack on when there's a bit of money left over. It's not just a 'nice to have'. We see culture and creativity as central to our quality of life and our identity. We see the arts as a powerful force for positive change across many policy areas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  Australia is a creative nation with a rich cultural history. Our filmmakers, actors, musicians, writers and painters have a reputation for excellence, for storytelling and for capturing the hearts and minds of people across the world. This is no more true than in Wentworth, where the arts and culture are central to the fabric of our community. My electorate is home to over 10,000 people who work in the cultural and creative industries as well as 4,000 cultural businesses; it's extraordinary. In the past two weeks many of those have been part of the Vivid Sydney festival, with the incredible light show around the harbour drawing in more than 2½ million visitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But recent years have been tough, particularly for the arts. The sector has experienced neglect, which was compounded by the devastating effects of COVID-19. The livelihoods of many of our arts and cultural workers were threatened and in some cases suffered irreparable damage. So the support provided as part of the government's cultural policy is welcome, and it is imperative to the sector's survival and growth. But it is not just the promised funding that's important. It is the sentiment expressed by the policy that the arts do matter, that they're fundamental to our national psyche and that a healthy, vibrant and diverse cultural sector is essential to both our wellbeing and our economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Cultural Policy is a small step in the right direction. But, along with many people in Wentworth, I remain concerned about the long-term health of our screen sector and our ability to tell Australian stories. Telling authentic and diverse Australian stories helps us to recognise who we are, helps create a sense of community and respect for our diversity, and helps us to understand each other and to feel connected. But as more and more content is accessed via streamers, such as Netflix, Disney+ and Binge, access to Australian content is at risk. Without a legislative requirement for Australian content, multinational streamers may simply fill their schedules with cheaper repeats and international reality television. That's why an Australian quota for streaming services is critical. Requiring streamers to dedicate 20 per cent of their Australian revenue to making Australian dramas, documentaries and children's television would need only a modest increase in their investments, but it would protect our future by ensuring that Australian stories continue to be told to audiences across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the government's constructive and ongoing consultation on this issue, and it is critical that they get the details right. For example, expenditure obligation must apply to new commissions only, since buying titles that are several years old is of little benefit for the Australian screen sector. The government must also be cautious when considering so-called multipliers, which provide flexibility but could enable streamers to artificially meet their quota without real investment in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms should also protect Australian intellectual property. Currently too many producers are forced to hand over their IP in order to get their foot in the door with a multinational streamer, so they miss out on the benefits that should accrue when their programs are screened over many years. Putting in place a fixed term after which IP would revert back to the original content creators would ensure a just reward for the Australian screen sector. This is being done in other countries, such as France, and is something I hope the government will consider over the coming months.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  Last weekend, I went to the matinee performance of the Mount Eliza Community Pantomime's <span style="font-style:italic;">Cinderella</span>. It was extraordinary. It has to be said that I don't think I'll ever look at Reverend Cameron McAdam the same way again, having seen his performance in the pantomime! What was extraordinary was not just the talent of people from Dunkley and further down the peninsula who were performing in the pantomime; it was the level of interaction and sheer joy from the children and the adults that were in the crowd. It took one instance of a character looking out into the crowd and saying, 'Yes, I am,' for the kids to work out that they had to say, 'No, you're not,' in response. It took one slightly ribald innuendo for the parents and other the people, like me and my husband, to work out that there was going to be enough in the performance to keep the adults entertained as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What it all added up to was a feeling of community—a feeling of engagement, belonging and people being there to be part of something together. To me, that's what the arts and culture mean. Sure, sometimes they mean going to a gallery or a performance in the city at the arts centre. But more often than not arts and culture mean being part of a joyous exhibition, pantomime, play or live music performance in your local community with others who are either indulging in their hobby or performing in their profession in a way that makes you feel connected to the rest of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, that's why our new national cultural policy, <span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">evive</span>, is so important. It acknowledges the different roles for the arts and culture. It recognises that portfolios other than the arts are intrinsically involved and use the arts and culture to benefit communities. When last month the Department of Social Services announced more than a million dollars in funding for arts projects, one might have thought, 'Why?' It was because these arts projects serve policy objectives in that portfolio. It's funding for projects to support young people aged 12 to 18 years, people with disability and mental health issues, vulnerable women or unemployed people to express themselves and to get capabilities, confidence and engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the grants went to Big hART for a First Nations program for youth aged 12 to 18 in outback Western Australia—a long way from Dunkley. But in Dunkley Big hART have run Project O, which was a project for young women in Frankston North to understand that they could be leaders and change not just their lives but the lives of others around them and their community. It's a program about resilience, strength and leadership, and it's an arts program. That's the sort of funding that will come under <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span>, which is so important for communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The terrific Special Envoy for the Arts spoke about visiting services for people with disability and how the arts have the power to fundamentally change people's lives and build a stronger, more inclusive society. We see that with BAM Arts in my electorate. More than once I've tried to keep up with the dance moves of Buster and other adults with intellectual disabilities and have failed—as the video, which my staff may have put up online, would show. It's just sheer joy and engagement from the parents and the adults who perform at BAM. Recently, BAM graciously invited the minister to come and talk to locals about the value of the arts. One of the things that came out of a roundtable I held was the need for better community theatres and facilities in my electorate so that community groups could put on performances like <span style="font-style:italic;">Strictly Ballroom</span>, which is coming up. I will be working with the community to get those facilities as fast as we can.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I thank the member for Macquarie for this really important motion. I want to acknowledge her visit to my electorate this month in her capacity as the Special Envoy for the Arts. She was hosted by my arts and culture roundtable at the Wangaratta Performing Arts &amp; Convention Centre, a venue we hope in time will, with adequate support, become a significant arts precinct in Wangaratta.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The roundtable was an opportunity for the local arts, culture and entertainment sector to discuss the new national cultural policy, Revive. The policy aims to create a place for every story and a story for every place, especially including in rural, remote and regional Australia. Regional Australia needs this focus after so long being just an afterthought. The roundtable was an opportunity for our community to learn how to benefit from this new approach and ask the tough questions of the special envoy about what this actually means in practice. The roundtable was attended by more than 70 people from all across Indi, from Yea Arts Inc. right down south, all the way through to the Flying Fruit Fly Circus on the border. Indi has a highly engaged and talented arts and cultural community, and a cross-section attended that roundtable, including practitioners in the performing arts, visual arts, music and museums; and professional practitioners, community practitioners, aspiring practitioners, teachers and students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite having such a thriving arts and cultural scene, the arts and cultural sector faces significant challenges after years of dwindling funding and the hollowing out of the sector due to the COVID public health measures. High on the list of questions at the roundtable were these barriers and what the policy can do to overcome them. We heard loud and clear that we need strong cultural infrastructure, and this means modern, appropriate precincts and buildings so we can attract the best talent to perform and exhibit in our galleries, libraries and theatres. We need support to upgrade our aging arts infrastructure, like the HotHouse Theatre in Wodonga, so it can keep commissioning local talent, producing, nurturing and presenting new contemporary Australian theatre coming directly from rural and regional Australia. These places enable our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To see the Revive policy come to fruition we must upgrade regional galleries like the Benalla Art Gallery. It has a creative vision for a world-class gallery which interfaces with the magnificent Lake Benalla, the CBD and the heritage botanical gardens. It's the perfect place to deliver the Revive policy's vision of the very best of our national collection touring the whole country. These artworks are proudly owned by all Australians, and they should be accessed by all Australians, no matter where they live. I thank the Friends of Benalla Art Gallery for attending the roundtable and for their ongoing advocacy with this really important and exciting vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the roundtable we also discussed the jobs, skills and local training that's required for our arts economy to truly thrive—for our producers, our technicians and the people who make it possible to showcase locally everything that the arts has to offer. David Godkin, a dedicated arts educator, raised the value of specialised arts teachers and how important arts education is for the health and wellbeing of our young people and for the future of the workforce. Jobs and Skills Australia has been established by the government to provide advice on workforce needs, including in the arts, and I urge them to consider a skills package to grow our regional arts and culture workforce. I especially thank all the participants for attending the roundtable and engaging so enthusiastically and thoughtfully: Eric Nash, director of the Benalla Art Gallery; Pamela O'Connor from the Friends of Benalla Art Gallery; Margie Gleeson from the HotHouse Theatre and Arts Yackandandah; and many more. Thank you for all you do to protect and promote the arts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Indi, I take special pride in how our community showcases the arts across our towns. I recently attended the Rotary Alexandra Annual Easter Art Show, which has been running for a remarkable 53 years; the Mount Beauty Annual Easter Art Show; and ART in the Autumn, organised by Beechworth Arts Council. I congratulate the organisers and participants of these impressive exhibitions and the volunteers that make them happen, because they tell our stories back to us. That is what is so valuable and deserves our support. I look forward to continuing to work with the member for Macquarie on how we can make the most of the Revive policies in Indi. As David Godkin reflected to me after the roundtable, 'We must continue this much-needed arts revival, survival and enable a thriving arts culture,' and I could not agree more.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  Art is good for the soul. It uplifts us. It is a mirror to our culture. It is the great equaliser. It bridges our divides and enriches our lives. Whether it's our stories being told, our music being played or our world being interpreted through paint, dance, textiles, stone or clay, the arts are central to our being. It is through these many and varied forms that we build our identity as a nation and project our culture to the world. That's why we must respect and celebrate all those who create our nation's stories, in songs, in words and in visual imagery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it was a real privilege to joyously celebrate early this month with the Minister for the Arts and our Left Right Out band as we joined on stage some of our nation's iconic musical storytellers the Wiggles and singer-songwriter Dan Sultan. Everyone knows the words 'Toot, Toot, Chugga, Chugga, Big Red Car.' The Wiggles phenomenon has been exported to the world. Through them and so many other artists are national identity is known globally. The Albanese government understands the importance of this, and that's why we are once again celebrating and investing in the arts, turning the page on a new chapter in Australia's cultural story, a new narrative fuelled by the Albanese government's passion for our nation's artists to thrive and grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's new national cultural policy <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span> will unlock opportunities, tell stories in fresh and compelling ways and, importantly, drive employment and investment for our creative industries. Through <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span>, we have committed to rebuilding a $17 billion industry, which employs more than 400,000 Australians, after a lost decade of federal policy drift and funding neglect. This is important work and long overdue. Backed by $286 million over four years, <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span>'s centrepiece is Creative Australia. Creative Australia will now include a First Nations-led body that will give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people greater say in arts investment. Music Australia will invest in our music industry, taking more local bands from the pub to triple J and on to the international stage. Writers Australia will support writers and illustrators so that our bookshops are filled with our local stories. Finally, Creative Workplaces, a centre for art and entertainment workplaces, will ensure creative workers are fairly paid and have safe workplaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span> and Creative Australia, we will expand economic opportunity, support ethical marketplaces and provide more venues to showcase our national identity to the world. Beyond Creative Australia, our government is providing $2.6 million to provide specialist in-school arts education programs that draw from creative-sector expertise. We're investing in digital and media literacy to empower Australian children to become active and responsive online. We're providing pilot funding of $4.2 million to support access to art and music therapy programs. And we're developing an arts and disability plan for people and theatregoers, like the internationally acclaimed Back to Back Theatre based in Geelong, to provide an opportunity to participate fully in the creative life of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, through <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive'</span>s many reforms, we're making sure that Australians have an opportunity to add colour to the canvas of our nation's future. I'm grateful to the many artists and organisations who have contributed to creating this policy, to our arts minister for his work in sculpting a new future through our creative industries and to the member for Macquarie for putting forward this motion today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, a new chapter in Australia's cultural story has begun. I'm confident that <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span> will support artists to survive and grow and will ensure our stories continue to be told with originality, wit, creativity and flair. In the words of the iconic Aussie band AC/DC, it's a long way to the top for our nations artists. But through <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span>, I believe we are set for a generation of new sensations to hit our diverse and vibrant arts scene.</span>

Like many myths, it is not based in fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me share some facts with you about the spending on the arts under the previous government. Our $200 million Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand Fund, RISE, has delivered some 541 shows, events, festivals and productions all around Australia. And indeed, it would have been $220 million because we put an extra $20 million into the March 2020 budget, but for some mysterious reason, the incoming arts minister killed that money off. Apparently, he didn't want to spend another $20 million on the arts. We provided $50 million for the Temporary Interruption Fund which was so key to keeping the Australian film and television sector going through the pandemic. There was $90 million in loans through the Show Starter Loan Scheme, and $50 million in our sustainability fund, which we provided to allow major systemically important companies to secure additional funding to get through the terrible challenges of COVID. And, of course, the combined effect of JobKeeper, the cash-flow relief provided to businesses and other measures meant that total funding going to the cultural and creative sector throughout COVID exceeded $10 billion. It was far and away the largest injection of funding into the arts ever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also announced the 30 per cent digital games tax offset to provide a huge boost to the digital games sector, where Australia is underweight right now compared to competitor nations like the UK and Canada. There's enormous potential for that sector. We provided very substantial funding for our national collecting institutions: $22 million for the new gallery at Bundanon in 2019; $20 million for lighting upgrades to the National Gallery in 2020; $28.6 million for capital works at the National Gallery in May 2021; nearly $30 million for Trove at the National Library between 2016 and 2023; and in 2021, $47 million for digitising and preservation of works held across eight national collecting institutions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, we provided a transformational support to attract global screen productions to Australia: $540 million for the Location Incentive program which delivered an effective 30 per cent level of support for production budgets for these global screen productions. We attracted 32 international productions to Australia, attracted private investment of over $2.84 billion and generated more than 20,500 employment opportunities for local cast and crew. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you put all this together, you see that the foundation myth of the Labor Party—that, somehow, when the coalition is in government, the arts doesn't get support—is entirely at odds with the facts. I'll tell you something else. Do you know which government was in power when Commonwealth arts funding reached a record level? I'll give you a clue: that record funding was some $1 billion of Commonwealth arts funding that occurred in 2021-22. It was under a coalition government. So the foundation myth that the Labor Party is once again peddling in this private member's motion today is entirely at odds with the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a closer look at the minister's much hyped national cultural policy. When it was released, the Minister for the Arts claimed there was $286 million in additional funding over four years. But experienced observers of the current Minister for the Arts know that it's always wise to check the detail. When you check the detail, what you find is that, of that money, $45 million came from cancelling the coalition's very successful Temporary Interruption Fund, and, in total, the new funding came to only around $60 million a year—not to be sneezed at, of course, but not in the same league as the $1.1 billion in new arts funding announced by the coalition in the last term of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had a lot of effort by this government into putting more Commonwealth officials into employment. Every Australian who feels that we have a pressing need for more Commonwealth arts officials will no doubt be delighted by this budget. But the fact is, every dollar which goes to fund more bureaucrats is a dollar that cannot go to artists, performers and people in the arts sector who deliver actual arts activities that Australians can be informed and entertained by. Our focus in government was getting more money to the front line; this government wants to spend more money in Canberra.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I think we all remember having that wobbly, nervous feeling in the pit of our stomachs before stepping onto stage for a performance in primary or high school. To share our talents with our families in the school community was easier for some than for others. However daunting performances were for some, it was good for us and aided our growth and development. Students who did drama, art or music would know that those skills can bring a lifetime of fulfilment. Our arts minister, the member for Watson, and our other musically and artistically inclined MPs in this place would understand the passion and satisfaction of the arts. That is why the Albanese Labor government truly understands the important role the arts can play in building a stronger and more inclusive society—lived experience of and through the arts. We often talk about lived experiences when referring to mental health, and a little later I will speak about mental health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the societal benefits reach further and can build a more diversified economy and a more skilled workforce. Our new national cultural policy, Revive, recognises the contribution that the arts and cultural sector also makes to other portfolios. There are many areas in which the arts make a positive contribution to important policy objectives, including education, the environment, tourism, regional development, and foreign affairs and trade. Positives can abound in health, mental health and issues affecting First Nations Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within my electorate of Pearce, arts are an integral part of so many lives and bring sheer joy to thousands of people. We have many schools, public and private, that offer excellent art programs, which include dance, music and visual and dramatic arts. The Subih brothers, who are from the electorate of Pearce, received the Golden Buzzer when they appeared on <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Got Talent</span>. We also have Jordan Anthony, who was a finalist in <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Voice</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>on Delta Goodrem's team. This indicates clearly the importance of amateur theatre and all that the arts can provide. The Limelight Theatre, where many good budding actresses and actors start, is a great starting point for them. Ukelele groups, dance troupes, craft groups, youth bands, brass bands and so much more provide a great platform for our youth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A high school student from the suburb of Clarkson, Indigo Ellis, who is a talented First Nations singer and songwriter, won a local talent competition called Search for a Star and performed with the Perth Symphony Orchestra at the Symphony Under the Stars. Our fantastic local Challenge Brass Band has been bringing tremendous joy to the community for many years. Let's not forget the amazing Snapshot Youth Theatre Company and One Big Voice, both of which I am very proud to be patron of. Indigo Ellis has been chosen as an ambassador for the Valuing Children Initiative. VCI is passionate about giving a voice to young people, and what better voice than Indigo, who is equally as passionate? Without even knowing it, Indigo Ellis is championing the heart and mission of Revive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Pearce, the song 'Impressions of You' was written to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer and to help a mother and father cope with the grief of losing their son to cancer. Tony Hughes from Mindarie wrote a song to help his neighbours Colin and Wendy Herbert deal with the immense grief of losing their son Mark to pancreatic cancer last year. The song was part therapy and part gift to Tony's friends, who were left devastated by the death of their beloved son. Tony, Colin and Wendy are all musicians, and the project brought people together. It's an excellent example of arts in the wider community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Revive invests in education by providing $2.6 million to support specialist in-school arts education programs. In the areas of health and mental health, Revive provides pilot funding of $4.2 million to support access to art and music therapy programs. In the disability space, we're delivering an arts and disability associated plan under <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's Disability Strategy 2021-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">20</span><span style="font-style:italic;">31</span>. The Department of Social Services is investing more than a million dollars of funding for arts projects that serve policy objectives in that portfolio. The funding includes $340,000 for Big hART for First Nations youth aged 12 to 18 in outback Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the arts and cultural sector provides benefits far beyond the arts community itself and that Revive will begin repairing the damage caused by a decade of neglect of the arts by the previous government. Thank you very much, and I commend the act to you. I truly appreciate the work and the understanding that the Albanese Labor government has for the arts and its importance within our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I rise to take the opportunity that this motion on the National Cultural Policy provides to talk about a really concerning development in my home city of Adelaide, and that is the prospect of the scrapping by the Labor government there of the Indigenous art and cultures gallery, which is co-invested in by the Commonwealth and the state, at the Royal Adelaide Hospital site. It is something that is absolutely unbelievable, given how that government has purported to have a regard for and interest in Indigenous affairs. Yet the investment in a national Indigenous arts and cultures gallery is, for all intents and purposes, being completely unwound. And that opportunity, which would have seen, beyond question, the greatest representation of Indigenous art and Indigenous culture on the planet in my home city of Adelaide, funded by the Commonwealth government and the state government, now appears not to be going ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's even more remarkable that the government appointed an expert panel led by Bob Carr, a former senator here, as well as a former foreign minister and premier of New South Wales, and that panel recommended not only proceeding with but expanding the investment in that. And the Malinauskas government is refusing to do that, refusing to follow the advice of a panel that they appointed—all in the name of saving money by ripping funding away from the arts, particularly Indigenous arts. That is absolutely heartbreaking, and it says a lot about the true genuine commitment towards the arts and culture, particularly Indigenous culture, by that Labor government in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been involved in the Indigenous arts and culture gallery for a long, long time, particularly since being a member and before then, because the City Deal that was signed saw the bringing together of the funding required by the then Marshall Liberal government that brought this proposal forward and said that Adelaide wanted to be the home of the greatest collection of Indigenous art and culture in a purpose built, breathtaking dedicated facility that would have been an international tourist attraction. That opportunity was exciting and is now, regrettably, to be lost to the city of Adelaide. It is also a really appalling snub to Indigenous Australians—that we will not see them get that great representation of their culture in—and of course I say this selfishly—my home city of Adelaide, but it was a national facility that the Commonwealth government was co-investing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I really do lament that, and I condemn it as absolutely appalling and disgusting to seek a cost saving in that way and to not follow the recommendation of a former Labor premier of New South Wales to embrace and enhance that decision and instead see it as a way of saving money. It says all that needs to be said about the attitude of the Malinauskas government in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to have the South Australian Film Corporation based in my electorate, and on this motion relating to culture in this country I commend them, as I always do, as being the great trailblazers of Australian film. There are so many great examples in the past and even more exciting ones into the future of what that institution is doing in my electorate of Sturt in bringing Australian stories in particular to the screen. The way in which they are succeeding on the international stage as well is a very important reminder, when we talk about cultural policy, that it is not something that is all about how much taxpayer funds are invested but is in fact about empowering Australian creativity and ingenuity, which can absolutely succeed and thrive in an internationally competitive market, particularly as online and digital content is now. There are businesses that are based out there, that work with businesses in North America and Europe. And of course Adelaide, as is all of Australia, is very lucky from a time-zone point of view that a project can be passed from Los Angeles to Adelaide to London and back again and a 24/7 work plan can be undertaken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I commend the South Australian Film Corporation and all the cultural institutions in my electorate, in my home state of South Australia. I lament that we perhaps won't have that great Indigenous art and cultures institution which Labor have chosen to walk away from. It's appalling and a disgrace, and I urge them to reconsider.</span>

There are too many for me to list here today, but perhaps one of the most significant partnerships took effect on 3 October 2021, when the Australian Space Agency reached an agreement with NASA for an Australian made semi-autonomous rover to be part of a future mission to the moon. Through the flagship $150 million Moon to Mars Initiative, established under the coalition, the agency will support the mission through the Trailblazer program. The Trailblazer program will include an investment of $50 million in Australian businesses and researchers to develop and build the lunar rover. Australia's ability to develop and operate a rover like this is supported by our skills and experience in remote operations and autonomous systems here on Earth.</span>

Unlike previous instances, where Australian astronauts have flown as citizens of other nations, Katherine will train as an Australian under our flag.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of the very public achievements that have been made. Of course there was the establishment of the Space Discovery Centre at Lot Fourteen in Adelaide, which provides a showcase and an education centre to inspire our young astronauts of the future. It clearly wasn't established just so it could inspire astronauts; it was a key pillar of what the former government was doing to make sure that we were able to excite our young people about the opportunities that could be provided to them by studying science, technology, engineering and maths whilst they were at school.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  I am delighted to speak about the Australian space sector, which is an incredibly fast-growing sector of our economy. The global space industry is currently worth at least $366 billion, but it's forecast to reach as much as $1 trillion in value by 2040. I'd be very surprised if it doesn't reach that target well before that time. The Australian Space Agency has the goal of tripling our space industry here, capturing a $12 billion market share—up from $5.2 billion in 2018-19—and creating 30,000 jobs by 2030. The Albanese government recognises that the space sector can make a very valuable contribution to Australia's modern economy. Whether this is in deploying technology to track bushfires from orbit or developing autonomous space systems with applications in mining and agriculture, the space industry is delivering and will continue to deliver for Australians. That's why our government is backing the industry in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund will provide future funding opportunities for the space industry. Space sector projects are explicitly included in the enabling capabilities priority area. I welcome this private motion, but the fact that the opposition is today raising the National Reconstruction Fund and what it should do is quite frankly astounding. I simply remind those opposite that they voted against the National Reconstruction Fund. I'm happy to be bipartisan on these issues, as these private members' bills often are, but the fact is that they did vote against. I think it's worth noting. They're saying one thing and voting the other way. But this $392 million industry growth program that our government has announced in the budget will also provide opportunities for space companies. Across government, there is $10 billion available to support the space sector over the forward estimates and beyond, so, for those opposite to suggest that there's an underinvestment in the Australian space industry, those opposite must seriously be on another planet. Maybe that's what they're trying to do—get back home, hoping they'll get picked up!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working closely with our international partners to develop our space industry. It's incredibly exciting, as the previous speaker said, that Katherine Bennell-Pegg, an employee of the Australian Space Agency, became the first Australian to train as an astronaut with the European Space Agency. Additionally, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Deputy Administrator Pamela Melroy visited Australia in March, which was the first such visit since 2014. I had a good yarn with them up at the US ambassador's house. During the visit, Administrator Nelson called for an Australian astronaut to fly with NASA. Australia has a long history of collaboration in space with the US, dating back to the 1950s, including by helping to broadcast the Apollo 11 moon landing to the world and tracking the most recent Artemis mission. It makes me very proud that Australia joined the United States Moon to Mars exploration program. Just last month, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Joe Biden announced the technology safeguards agreement, or TSA, on the sidelines of the G7 in Japan. The TSA will allow for the transfer of US space technology, including rockets and satellites, to be launched from Australia. Honourable members will probably know and understand that there have been NASA rockets fired from the Northern Territory. Out near the Garma site in Arnhem Land, not far from Nhulunbuy, we saw those rockets launch into space. The territory's geographic location provides a host of benefits for launch facilities and for ground stations because we're close to the equator, we have a low population in the Southern Hemisphere and we have clear skies with low-light pollution. For all your rocket launching needs, just come up to the Northern Territory. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time </span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I am very pleased to support this private member's motion by the member for McPherson, and I want to acknowledge her longstanding commitment to both STEM and to the space industry, particularly through her role as an engineer in the passion she brings to this particular area of manufacturing. As the Australian Space Agency marks its fifth year on 1 July, since its inception it's been providing a centralised pathway that promotes the collaboration that we've heard the member for McPherson speaking about and is bringing together the public and private sectors to achieve world-class research projects and outcomes. It's achieving very high-quality outcomes in what is a short period of time. It's a testament to the vision of the previous coalition government and its investment in the sector. It's no wonder that Australia's share of the global space economy grew by 30 per cent during 2019-20 as the agency worked to develop, assess and target the areas of importance, to close market gaps in the sector and to enable and facilitate commercial investments where Australia holds that competitive advantage.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first optical communications ground station is based at the University of WA. This project is changing the way we communicate between ground and space based assets and has the potential to enable the high-speed transfer of large volumes of data very quickly and securely. We've also got ground stations to be based in South Australia, the ACT and New Zealand, and the growth of the project is a great outcome for the Australian Space Agency and collaborators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fantastic project has been enabled through collaboration with the European Space Agency with construction underway of a 35-metre deep-space tracking satellite dish in New Norcia, 140-odd kilometres north of Perth. The antenna will feature the latest in the cryogenically cooled technologies to boost signal reception and will be locally operated by some of Australia's best scientists from CSIRO. The site was chosen in 2019, with construction expected to be completed in 2024.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is creating some uncertainty for the space industry throughout Australia. The former coalition government, through the establishment of the Australian Space Agency and its commitment to projects worth $2.5 billion, actually supported 10,000 Australian workers. I note that Labor didn't even invite a representative from the space sector to their jobs forum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We actually included space as one of six National Manufacturing Priorities. It's very important we understand the importance of this industry to Australia and to our future. As a government, we wanted to ensure that we had the best framework in place for the sector to succeed, and that is what we're seeing now. Certainly we must, as a nation, provide a clear commitment to the space sector. Not doing so will actually halt the momentum that's been gained. We also looked at what's ahead in the national defence sector, and we looked at the over-the-horizon issues and the potential weaponisation of satellites. There are very good reasons for Australia to be in this field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We work with others around the world like NASA and the European Space Agency. Anne Bettens and Tarkin Eckersley are both from my electorate and are great examples of the pathway we're providing for young and mature Australians alike. Anne grew up in Harvey and went on to study a PhD at the University of Sydney's school of aerospace and engineering. She specialises in autonomous navigation of satellites for space exploration. She was selected as one of just two Australians to attend a 10-week internship program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Tarkin Eckersley grew up in the small town of Dunsborough. He has a significant and extremely important role with NASA, where he works in the hazardous gas leak detection team to ensure the safe launch of rockets for NASA's Artemis missions. His team sits in the launch control centre.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For anyone who is wondering what space means for them, have a think about the things that have come out of space technology and exploration: scratch-resistant lenses, cordless tools for our tradespeople at work, ear thermometers now used in hospitals, sat navs in cars for satellite navigation, the memory foam now used in mattresses, smoke detectors, safety grooving for runways and roads, LED lights, portable computers—the list goes on.</span>

I represent the seat of Adelaide, and a lot of the space industry is based in my electorate. My state of South Australia has a vibrant space ecosystem, with over 90 space organisations, including a significant number of defence prime operating space businesses, high growth SMEs and the headquarters of the SmartSat CRC, as well as the Australian Space Agency headquarters. I'm very proud to represent these groups in my electorate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is making sure that the Australian Space Agency maintains its presence in Adelaide. I'm very pleased about that because we know how important the space sector is not just to the Australian economy but also to the South Australian economy. With offices around the country and with a clear purpose, the agency will continue to deliver nationally. South Australian companies and projects have received over $550 million in public and private investments since 2018 out of a total pipeline of $3 billion. Over $340 million of total investment in my home state in the space sector—most of it in my electorate—has come from industry or private equity investment. That is a big vote of confidence for the market in South Australian know-how. I'm very proud of that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The space sector can be an essential ingredient for our nation to achieve greater economic success, as well as greater economic complexity, supporting adjacent high-tech industries from agriculture to resources and advanced manufacturing. Space can also play a leading role in developing Australia's emerging critical technologies such as quantum, AI—artificial intelligence—robotics and other priority areas for this government and its focus. Space both leverages and creates markets for these technologies, feeding into the development for the benefit of all industries and for the wellbeing of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it might be the glamour stories—such as stories about rocket launches—that grab the headlines, on this side of the House we know that businesses powering the Australian space industry are getting on with the job of developing the skills and technologies that we require now, and will require into the future, that help Australians every day. Whether it be deploying technology to track bushfires from orbit or developing autonomous space systems with applications in mining and agriculture, this space industry is delivering for Australians, and the government wants to back the practical work in it. That includes the work of companies like Fleet Space Technologies, whose network of minisatellites and ground sensors—which are manufactured in Adelaide—is helping the mining sector to conduct mineral exploration activities more quickly, safely, affordably and with minimal environmental impact. Fleet also run in-house programs to train up the next generation of STEM talent from a range of backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the kinds of practical applications of space technologies that we on this side of the chamber are interested in. One of our first actions as a government was to announce approval for NASA to launch a series of rockets from Arnhem Space Centre in the Northern Territory—a historic moment for the space industry in Australia. It was the first commercial space launch in Australia and the first time NASA has launched from a commercial spaceport outside the US. That's a vote of confidence in Australian know-how and capability that we should all be proud of. The nature of space is that it attracts the best of Australian science and technology talent, and for that reason it pushes us to new horizons—literally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government wants Australians from all corners of the community to have access to interesting, rewarding, well-paid and secure jobs, including in the space industry. We know that for many young Australians space is a very inspiring gateway to study and work in the broader world of science and technology. That's why it was incredibly exciting that Katherine Bennell-Pegg, an employee of the Australian Space Agency, became the first Australian-born woman to represent our nation in astronaut training within the European Space Agency. Through role models like Katherine we can encourage more of our young people to pursue STEM-related careers— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'd like to acknowledge the member's tenure as the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology under the coalition government and, in particular, her interest and passion for the Australian space sector. I would like to wish the Australian Space Agency a very happy birthday, noting that on 1 July it will be five years since its official establishment. I know that Enrico Palermo, head of the agency, will have something very special planned.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I too have had the great honour of being a minister responsible for space, when I was the minister for both the defence industry and the science and technology portfolios. During this time I had the great honour of meeting many Australian companies working hard to fill our nation's space needs. While I was minister I was pleased to address the Australian Space Forum and outline our ambitious vision for the sector. Our mission was to triple Australia's space sector size to $12 billion and create an extra 20,000 highly skilled jobs by 2030. Whilst this goal was ambitious, it was achievable with our strong commitment to the space sector. Competition in the global space sector is fierce, but with our focused efforts to leverage Australia's competitive advantage we were making very good progress. With the coalition's establishment of the Australian Space Agency in 2018, we built a very strong foundation for leading the charge. Since the agency was established, over $2.5 billion in investment has flowed into the sector from government, the private sector and international space agencies. We maintained our focus on supporting the sector to grow, by investing in building capability, strengthening those partnerships and inspiring the next generation of Aussie space workers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the Labor Party's decision to defund crucial programs such as the Australia spaceports program, the Australian technology into orbit program and a subprogram of the Moon to Mars program sends a message of complacency and missed opportunity and undermines this vision. These programs were aimed at helping space organisations be part of the supply chain for NASA's ambitious plans to return to the moon and, eventually, journey to Mars. By defunding these initiatives, the Labor government undermines our potential contributions to global space exploration and deprives our industries of the opportunities for growth and innovation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was obvious to the space industry in Australia that the coalition government understood very clearly the importance of developing a sovereign space industry for civil and defence purposes and had the vision and the policies to support this. Sadly, what is now obvious is that the Albanese government has no vision and clearly does not understand that the Australian space industry is important for business and national security. You have to ask yourself: why did the Albanese Labor government cut around $70 million from growing Australia's space industry program in the last budget, and why isn't space a standalone priority under the Labor government's National Reconstruction Fund?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Australia's first national space mission—the National Space Mission for Earth Observation—is now under threat, due to these irresponsible cuts by the Labor government. This mission, which was intended to build satellites to detect and respond to bushfires and floods, as well as to undertake maritime surveillance, put Australia at the forefront of a progressively promising industry. The coalition announced $1.2 billion for this project in March 2022. At the time, James Brown, the Chief Executive Officer of the Space Industry Association of Australia, described it as 'the most strategic and significant space public policy in 40 years'. I agree with you, James.</span>

                  </span>I would like to finish on a positive note and send my best wishes to all Aussie students who are participating in the Spacesport America Cup this week in New Mexico in the United States. Many Australian universities are well represented, including the University of Western Australia, from my home state. Last year's overall winner of the Spaceport America Cup was the University of Sydney's USYD rocketry team, which is further proof that Australia has got talent. We can only hope that Australia can take advantage of all this talent, but it requires space vision and funding of the vision, which unfortunately, the current government is failing on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for McPherson has moved a motion that suggests that Australia's space industry has been de-prioritised by this government, but nothing could be further from the truth. We are proud of the work we are doing in this area. Across the government there is $10 billion available to support the space sector over the forward estimates and beyond, so the coalition must be on another planet if it suggests that there is underinvestment in the Australian space industry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a species, we have been fascinated by the sky for the entirety of our existence, and we often look to the stars for guidance and meaning. Dr Gemma Anderson, a Swan local, an astrophysicist and a mother from my mothers group, has talked to me about the moment she fell in love with the sky. Her dad showed her the stars through a telescope, and from that moment Gemma knew that she would dedicate her career to our galaxy, as many Australians have done. Gemma's research as an astrophysicist with the International Centre of Radio Astronomy Research uses radio telescope arrays on earth to observe explosions in space. This is a further amazing space of research and development being done in my electorate of Swan through the wonderful Curtin University. Also, the Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy is part of the team that built the square kilometre array. This telescope will allow researchers to explore our galaxy at a greater resolution. The exciting Binar space program is led by Curtin Uni's Space Science and Technology Centre. The Binar space satellite is a tiny satellite that you can hold in your hand. I was so proud to witness this amazing technology with the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, last year. This is the first spacecraft to be designed and built in Australia. Curtin is also a founding partner of AROSE, or Australian Remote Operations for Space and Earth. AROSE was a successful applicant to the Australian Space Agency's Moon to Mars trailblazer program. AROSE will receive $4 million to design, build, test and operate prototypes of a semiautonomous rover which will support NASA's Artemis program.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for McPherson has also noted that 1 July marks the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the Australian Space Agency. Sadly, we are also approaching another significant anniversary for the Australian space industry—that is, the axing of the National Space Program on 30 June 1996 by the Howard government. The Australian Space Office comprised only 20 people and had a budget of $6 million. With the closure of this office, in 1996, Australia's Near-Earth Object Surveyor effort was also shut down. On an episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span>, this program was wrongly described as a 'fruitless, unnecessary, self-indulgent exercise'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the then minister for science, Peter McGauran, received a letter signed by 91 asteroid scientists and related scientists about the benefits of keeping the existing program and how a more-rigorous research program would add to Australia's capabilities at a very meagre cost, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm not going to be spooked, or panicked, into spending scarce research dollars on a fruitless attempt to predict the next asteroid.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Does this remind us of anything? You can't trust those opposite with science. They don't consistently accept the science, whether that be space science, conservation science or climate science. Let's face it, this defines the LNP approach to science: always putting politics before the science and Australia's best interests. There are many parallels between the decision to axe the National Space Program and the decisions on research and science funding during the lost decade under the coalition government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government hasn't wasted a day in seeking to better support Australia's higher education sector, an essential pillar of our nation's workforce, prosperity and future. Our commitment to ensuring that all Australians can pursue their educational aspirations and make meaningful contributions to society is demonstrated by our government's commitment to expanding university places in skill-deficient areas, facilitating the return of international students and introducing start-up legislation to support people to innovate within the higher education sector. This commitment is also demonstrated in our government's commitment to delivering a higher education system that is fit for purpose, meeting the current and future needs of the nation through our historic Universities Accord process. Higher education is a sector that is very important to me, personally—as someone who started their career in higher education—and also to my community, given that we have two universities and that a lot of my constituents are in study or work in the higher education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By providing an additional 20,000 university places to areas where skills are needed, particularly for individuals who've historically been under-represented in our universities, our government has made significant progress towards fostering inclusivity and addressing the skills gap. Our proactive approach to identifying areas where specific skills are in demand exemplifies our unwavering commitment to expanding access to higher education. Our government is providing up to $485.5 million over the period 2022-23 to 2025-26 to deliver a one-off boost to additional commencing Commonwealth supported places. That's a really big deal. That's 20,000 people who will be able to pursue their ambitions of getting a degree through one of our wonderful universities in Australia. We've demonstrated a strong understanding of the significance of aligning educational pathways with the changing demands of the workforce by strategically directing the locations towards areas where skills are needed for these places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important to note that we have a deep and real commitment to inclusivity in the higher education sector, taking steps to increase inclusivity and provide equal educational opportunities for all Australians by allocating a significant portion of the additional university places to students from under-represented backgrounds. We know from data that access to higher education has historically been difficult for certain groups, including Indigenous Australians, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and those living in regional and remote areas. We are committed to fixing this. We are committed to helping those who aspire to attend university to get to university. Our government is committed to inclusivity when it comes to higher education. A tertiary sector that cultivates and celebrates diverse perspectives, encourages innovation and enriches the academic discourse by providing pathways for individuals who have historically been under-represented in our universities will be a better tertiary sector. Dedicating ourselves to ensuring that all Australians can pursue their educational aspirations and make meaningful contributions to society is foundational to Labor's commitment to the future of the higher education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To promote long-lasting and fundamental change in our higher education system, our government, with oversight from the Minister for Education, has initiated a once-in-a-generation higher education review via the Australian Universities Accord. This accord is the first broad review of the higher education system since the Bradley review, and it is an opportunity to look at everything from funding and access to affordability, transparency, regulation, employment conditions and how higher education and vocational education and training can and should work together. Led by the Minister for Education, and with advice from a panel of eminent Australians, this panel and this process will engage all sectors and groups affected by higher education policy, including and not limited to universities, higher education and VET providers, educators and researchers, students, parents, unions, business, state and territory governments, and groups who've been under-represented in higher education. Importantly, this panel will make recommendations to government. We've received over 300 discussion papers already through that engagement program, and there have been over 80 stakeholder meetings already. I'm really looking forward to continuing to support higher education in Australia— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I thank the member for Chisholm for moving this important motion before the House, and I associate myself with many of her comments, apart from that bit about the 10 years of neglect. What a shock that we don't agree on that particular point! I'm speaking as someone who has been a consumer of education with my family for the best part of 20 years. We've had a bit of a one-family road test of the Australian education system as my four children have gone through primary school, secondary school and now university. Two of my children have graduated from university and two are still studying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I want to acknowledge the impact of COVID on our education sector and, in particular, the impact that it had on our teachers, parents and students as they dealt with a large number of challenges in a compressed period of time, which made it very difficult for many students, particularly those attending the later years of secondary college, to fulfil their obligations at that time. I want to thank the teaching community and their support networks for the work they did, particularly in looking after the welfare of students as they dealt with those rather challenging times. Remote learning wasn't easy for a lot of our young Australians, and I think they've come out the other side more resilient and stronger but still requiring some additional support as they move on to university and attempt to fulfil their tertiary studies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many members in this place, I have a great passion for helping young people in my community to achieve their full potential, whether that be through the trades or through tertiary education. I think it's important that we instil in our young people what a great nation this is that we all get to enjoy, and also that we help them to recognise the opportunities that are there for them if they work hard and commit themselves to their studies and aspire to achieve everything they can possibly achieve with the skills that they have. I've been a proud supporter of the public education system. It was a choice that my family made. While I do respect choice and recognise that others choose the independent sector, my family and I chose the public sector because we wanted our children to have the opportunity to study close to home in their local primary school and secondary college. We actively supported our local public schools. My wife was a school council president for many years for the very reason that we wanted to be involved in our kids' education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one of our great challenges in our regional and rural areas—the member for Chisholm spoke of it when she mentioned the new government's commitment to inclusivity—is helping to overcome the aspirational and cost barriers for rural and regional students seeking to fulfil their full potential and go on to tertiary study. There are a lot of parts of rural and regional Australia where university access is very difficult. The previous government made some inroads in that regard through improvements to the tertiary access allowance and payments to assist students from rural and regional areas when they're relocating to a metropolitan environment. I fully acknowledge that all of the easy stuff has been done in terms of government in this country, and most of the reform now is very difficult. It's a challenge to build support outside of government, and also inside government, when it comes to the Expenditure Review Committee process and getting money out of Treasury and Finance, for further reforms. But I would encourage the minister in this regard, as he seeks to improve the inclusivity for rural and regional students, to note that we still lag behind in our rural, regional and remote areas in terms of participation at the highest level of education. A challenge remains, and I offer my bipartisan support to the new minister in seeing how we can overcome any of those barriers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aspirational barrier is something we need to deal with as leaders in our own communities. It's up to us as leaders in those communities to encourage our young people to achieve their best, but the cost barriers and economic barriers are things that the government can continue to work on. We're going to see now, I fear—with the increased cost of living, HECS indexation bills, rental shortages and price rises—that the costs of living away from home for rural and regional students will be a bigger barrier in the next five to 10 years than perhaps it has been in the last five or 10 years. So we have a real challenge in terms of helping those rural and regional students who have to relocate to a metropolitan environment to make sure that they're well supported as they do that and that we take every measure we can as a government to allow rural and regional students to achieve their full potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other challenges we have for regional university campuses is ensuring that our regional students see them as a worthwhile and viable choice. I think in my electorate of Gippsland, the Federation University at Churchill is increasing its range of courses, particularly around allied health, to encourage more young people to study in their own local area, because we know that those local young people who train and learn locally are more likely to work locally and help overcome some of those health and allied health workforce shortages that we face. So I encourage those opposite to recognise the important role of regional universities as they do their work and recognise the economic barriers that still face rural and regional students who are forced to move away from home. I'd also encourage them to continue to support our regional university campuses for the great work they do right throughout regional Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  Before I make a few provocative remarks about what needs to change in our great international education sector, let me be a hundred per cent clear: I love it. International students make an incredible contribution to Australia. They add vibrancy and diversity. They add over $40 billion economically and do jobs that help our country. They fund research in universities and new facilities. They build soft power for decades through human connections. As a country, we should be so grateful that young people choose to study here, and we should welcome them back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But—and, yes, there are now some big buts. The vast majority of the sector do wonderful things, but a minority of students, mainly in the bottom end of private VET, are only here to work, not study. Our student visa must not be used as a low-rent work visa. Australia's future success rests on two things: a quality education and a great student experience. After a decade of drift and neglect, Australia needs to lift our game and ruthlessly champion quality education to restore the sector's social licence and protect the good providers and students. So I want to float four possible reform ideas for debate. In private conversations, some have termed them 'nuclear options', but, hey, it's the Federation Chamber!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First: what if we revamp the entire accreditation framework for private VET providers to separate training from assessment? In year 12, assessment is fully outsourced from the school that taught the student, yet, in VET and higher ed, every provider does both the training and the assessment. What if that changed? Most providers do good things, but there are a significant minority that are selling dodgy work visas, and I'm struggling to see any other way to really regulate and ensure quality. When a car rolls off a factory production line, we determine quality by inspecting and testing it, yet in education ASQA inspect the paperwork and classroom and use that as a proxy for quality. It's like deciding that a car is quality by inspecting the factory, the tea room, the time sheets for the workers and the list of parts that made the car but never being allowed to check the car itself. Good quality providers are despairing. They report that dodgy providers just let the students in and pop the exam answers up on the board, and then the students write them down and go back to work. Can we ever really weed out the dodgy providers if we don't test the students?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second: what if most private VET providers enrolling international students then had to reapply for their training licence? There are 904 private providers in this country that teach VET to international students. Most are great, but some are not. If we raise the bar to become an assessment provider and force the higher risk private VET providers to have their students externally assessed, then it would shock the whole system. ASQA could rapidly put those colleges selling dodgy qualifications out of business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third: what if we suspended enrolments in low-value courses? If Australia is worried about rapidly growing student numbers, particularly in private VET, then why not just pause new recruitment to courses with non-vocational outcomes in which vast numbers of VET students are enrolled? Really—let's be honest. What benefit is Australia getting from tens of thousands of international students enrolled in certificates and diplomas in marketing, leadership or business? There are few, if any, migration pathways, the courses are cheap and many of the students are not studying—they're working. It's a low-rent work-visa scam. Suspending recruitment to such courses would be a quick way to moderate or reduce student numbers. It's controversial but food for thought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, what about education agents? Calls are growing right across the sector and the community to regulate the behaviour of onshore education agents. Agents play an important role in advising and recruiting new students from overseas. But rapacious onshore agents are destroying the integrity of the sector. They're demanding outrageous commissions of 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent. They're bribing and stealing students from universities to low-cost VET providers with kickbacks, discounts and incentives. They're not acting in the best interests of the student, as they're supposed to do. They're effectively selling students to increasingly desperate providers. Especially in light of the shocking revelations about human trafficking and criminal activity, regulating agents has really now become a question of how and when, not if. The reason it hasn't happened before is frankly because it's complex and expensive, and the sector is going to pay through cost recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what if this parliament simply banned the payment of commissions or kickbacks for onshore students entirely? Instead of trying to manage their behaviour with complex regulatory schemes, what if we simply wiped the intermediaries out? Is it time to prune the tree to save the tree? We should be supporting international education and chasing the highest-quality standards, and that may mean tough decisions.</span>

Those are some good things that we should debate and discuss. I particularly like his first point on reform potentially separating assessment from providers. I don't know if I misheard him, but I hope he means that for all providers, not just private providers. I think that assessment absolutely must be for the public system as well.</span>

                  </a>  I'd like to see the union that represents teachers in VET coming out and supporting the public system and the private system having a little bit of independent evaluation. That would be absolutely excellent. It would be dramatic, and there would be significant, significant consequences that the member for Bruce may or may not like to see. But we in the Liberal Party love merit-based assessment, reward for effort and breaking apart the protection racket of poor performance anywhere, particularly when it comes to educating the next generation of our nation. I welcome the suggestion by the member for Bruce, of all people, that some independent merit-based assessment of the entire VET system be put in place. I commit to working with him on that and supporting genuine reform that see the sunlight shine in upon the way in which the entire VET system operates. Certainly in my home state of South Australia it's almost entirely the government's system. But I'm sure they do not fear any form of independent oversight or assessment of the training that they provide or some kinds of published results of the quality of the education and training, as are being put in place. I think that's exciting, I warmly welcome it and I thank the member for Bruce for bringing that to our chamber. I look forward to seeing him get the education minister in the Labor government that he's a part of to bring forward reforms of that nature. I would look forward to speaking up in my party room were there any dissent to the concept of a robust, independent process for assessing the quality of the education that's provided across all registered training organisations in this country. I welcome the opportunity to unexpectedly agree with the member for Bruce on that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's talked about some other things. He's obviously very concerned about the amount of migration in this country. He's part of a government that's bringing in 1½ million people through things like, as he's just described, these dodgy renting-worker schemes. He's in the government, so I wish him all strength to his arm in convincing this government that the 1½ million people coming into the country across the forward estimates of the budget—without any planning for the infrastructure and services required to support that spectacular and dramatic increase in our population. I wish him well, within the government he's a member of, in succeeding in the debates, however the Labor Party have these debates, if they have them at all. I wish him well in what he's just expressed to the Federation Chamber in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having used most of my time talking about the member for Bruce, I will quickly put on the record in brief what I was going to say in my full five minutes, and that is that we certainly welcome the opportunity in this debate to talk about higher education and its important place within the tertiary system. The member for Bruce has made a good point by introducing VET into this debate, because for too long we've treated higher education as purely being about university-level degree qualifications, and it is wrong to have the sort of elitism in our society where we suggest that the optimal pathway is going to university. Welcome and good luck to all those like myself that go to university, but there are also a number of other very rewarding career pathways that don't require a need to go to university.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion talks about government funding to the sector. The most significant thing I'm being contacted about as a local member right now in this sector is the dramatic increase in HECS debts, which of course is occurring because inflation is so high. Of course, when you've got a government running inflation so high, everything that's index linked, including HECS debts, dramatically increases. It is surprising people with HECS debts, because I suppose they never thought that inflation could run this hot, but that's what happens under Labor governments. We're seeing it now, and we've seen it in the past. I merely say to all the students and others in my electorate who contact me that hopefully a change of government will see this high inflation reduced and those debts not increase so dramatically. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I thank Dr Garland, the member for Chisholm, for this higher education motion because education policies foster great transformational opportunities in life. That's why it's always at the core of labour policies and Labor policies—from setting up mechanics institutes and arts centres for workers to improve themselves at night back in the 1800s, right through to universal education and the Gonski reforms of this century. Education permits individuals and societies to thrive. Obviously, early childhood is crucial, primary and high school consolidate and allow some catch-up, and vocational education can then be an important pathway to prosperity and dignity. However, in this speech, I'd like to focus particularly on university education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways, university provides the pinnacle for many educational journeys—that transformative experience that opens doors, expands horizons and shapes the future not only of the individual but also of the country that they then shape with their knowledge. Therefore, ensuring access to university education is not just a matter of personal opportunity but a matter of societal progress. Having strong universities is in our national interest. That's why, just over a year after the Albanese Labor government was elected, we're delivering an additional 20,000 university places to tackle skills shortages and give more students from under-represented backgrounds the chance to go to university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country needs our best and brightest people at university. A university education plays a pivotal role in promoting social mobility and reducing inequality. It serves as a powerful equaliser, breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for individuals from all backgrounds, mixing the bush with the city, the poor with the wealthy, new Australians with old Australians and the rest of the world, all in that atmosphere of learning. Importantly, these extra 20,000 university places have been allocated to support students who are currently under-represented in our universities. These are students from poorer families, students from regional Australia—which would've been me 40 years ago—First Nations students, Australians with a disability, and students who are the first in their family to set foot in a university. These extra places have the potential to change people's lives, and I'm proud to be a part of a government that's helping to train the next generation of Australian workers to step up and take charge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also very proud to report that international students are on the way back. They're critical Australian assets; the biggest export that we don't dig out of the ground. It took a huge hit from COVID-19 for many years; this $40 billion export industry was cut in half. But international students have long played a significant role in our universities, and during the pandemic we really saw how the significant withdrawal of overseas students had such a negative impact on our university campuses—not just on their accounts but in so many other ways. Sadly, it wasn't helped by the fact that the international students who were living in Australia were told to 'go home' by the Morrison government. Remember those words? 'Go home.' Those words from the member for Cook did far more damage than his disastrous 'Where the bloody hell are you?' ad campaign from before he came into parliament. With those brutal words, the member for Cook turned our soft-power ambassadors into disgruntled agents and knockers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is rebuilding our international education sector. We've broken the back of the visa backlog and announced an extension of work rights for students who get degrees in areas where we have a skills shortage, and thankfully the students are coming back. Data from the ABS shows that more than 59,000 came to Australia in January—more than double the number in the same period last year—and almost 143,000 returned in February for the start of the university semester. We introduced our start-up legislation that will help young Australian entrepreneurs to get help to bring their ideas to life by creating a 2,000 HELP-style loans each year. The new loans will enable eligible students to participate in that higher education based accelerator program—loans that will give eligible students critical support and access to the mentors and facilities that they need to start their new businesses in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year the education minister announced the once-in-a-generation Universities Accord, which will build a long-term plan for Australia's higher education system and will be the first broad review of higher education since the Bradley review back in 2008. The Universities Accord is an opportunity to look at everything, from funding and access to affordability to transparency, regulation, employment conditions, and how higher and vocational education and training can and should work together.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  It is wonderful to talk on this motion. Higher education is so important to the future of our country as well as to the individual. I, like many in this House, am fortunate to have a degree. I can say that without the HECS system I wouldn't have had that opportunity. When I was growing up we did not have the financial means to pay for university. So, to be able to delay that payment was so important to me and to my siblings in being able to get an education at university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Sturt talked about, when talking about HECS, the biggest issue facing higher education that I hear about all the time is the inflation rate, now at 7.1 per cent, which means that HECS debts are being indexed at that rate, so many students are incurring an increase in their debt that is greater than their repayments, which is causing significant anguish and concern for them. It's not something we hear the government talking about. The obvious and first solution is to bring inflation down and focus on that, through their fiscal means, which they need to continue to do to drive inflation down to our two to three per cent band.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they also need to be creative and look at other ways to support students. I think we should have a conversation about mechanisms that we have—potentially pausing, much like the former government did with the fuel excise, cutting that rebate in half for six months because of the war in Ukraine. It was immediate action to give people relief at that time. We need to have a conversation about what we can do to help students who are incurring these HECS debts as we speak. So, I'd support any conversation that we can have in a bipartisan way to address this challenge for all students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But moving to the motion, I must say, it was a little bit light, after what this government says about 12 months of achievements, and in many ways it sums up some of the challenges here. There's not a lot happening in this space. But let's go through it in a little bit more detail. If we look at the 20,000 places that they've announced, it sounds great, although I always get concerned when there's a big announcement from this government about big numbers and what they've achieved, because generally when you look a little bit deeper it's actually not there in the detail. So, I trusted my instinct; I did a little bit research on the minister's own website about the 20,000 places. Interestingly, he lists only 13,389 that have been placed so far. So I thought, well, there's still 2023-24; we're running out of time, but potentially there are more to come. But applications closed on 19 September 2022. So, they closed last year, and almost 12 months later there's an almost 7,000-place shortfall in that 20,000. So this is question for the minister: is the announcement of 20,000 so we can get it out into the media with our press releases and move motions like this? Is it actually 20,000 places or are we going to end up at about 13,000? That would be a long way short of the 20,000 figure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in that detail—which the minister didn't talk about at the time—is the fact that this program is temporary. By 2028, the funding will be gone. It's not even going to exist. They didn't mention, at any stage, that it was temporary. Again, if you look below the media release and the headline with this government, the detail's not there to actually be supporting students. Obviously, facilitating the return of international students is fantastic and amazing. We've opened our borders and students across the globe are coming back. Well done! It would've happened anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the introduction of the start-up legislation: when Labor talk about supporting start-ups and entrepreneurships, what they don't talk about is the budget. They shut down the Accelerating Commercialisation program. They don't talk about how they closed the entrepreneurs' program, and they definitely don't talk about how they've frozen, and are potentially stopping, the Boosting Female Founders Initiative that supports female entrepreneurs to grow their businesses with seed money of $250,000 to $500,000. Again, we hear a lot about what they're doing; they don't talk about the cuts. We hear a lot about female participation in the workforce. It's vital. I can't think of anything more than important than supporting female entrepreneurs, particularly post COVID, as the digital economy has continued to climb and there are so many opportunities for all Australians. I know there are many women, mums in particular, that started their own business through COVID, and now they've had this program paused. It's taken away from them the certainty that they can create a great future for themselves and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is light on action. Even the measures they've included don't stack up, and it is not delivering for higher education. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  The benefits of higher education are clear. University graduates are more likely to be employed compared to their non-graduate counterparts, with 72 per cent of bachelor degree graduates in full-time employment within four months of completing their studies, compared to 58 per cent of people with only a high school qualification. Australian workers with a university degree earned 55 per cent more than those who only completed year 10. In summary, those with a university degree are more likely to be in full-time employment and are more likely to be earning more than those who don't have a degree. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is lost in these numbers, though, is the transformative power that higher education can have on an individual, and the impact that they can go on to have on our society. Consider someone like Professor Rae Cooper from the University of Sydney. She was the first in her family to go to university. It was a big adventure for a country kid from Merriwa in the Upper Hunter to move to Sydney to study. The adjustment for a country kid studying at one of Australia's leading universities can be overwhelming. It was something Professor Cooper experienced, and she dropped out in her first semester. She returned the next year, and not only did she survive university but she thrived. Majoring in industrial relations at the University of New South Wales, Professor Cooper was awarded the University Medal, and so began a lifelong love of researching work, employment and women. From there, she went on to complete her PhD at the University of Sydney, and she has been there ever since. We are all the beneficiaries of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Cooper has gone on to become one of the most influential researchers and thinkers on women in the workplace. She's the co-director of the Women, Work and Leadership Research Group at the University of Sydney Business School, an initiative studying gender and work, women's careers and flexible employment. Such has been the invaluable contribution of her research that she was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2019. Her contribution, however, extends beyond research and its application. Professor Cooper has also been a mentor for so many students who needed extra support at university. In her own words, she spent:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… 20 years identifying and seeking out students who looked lost in my classes. Down to the last one, they are first in family students, usually from the country or outer suburbs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Cooper was also my PhD supervisor, so I experienced firsthand how invaluable her mentorship can be. Sadly, that PhD is on hiatus now that I'm in this role, but I'm thankful to Professor Cooper for her support of me and so many other students. She changed lives in more ways than one. Professor Cooper's story is just one example of the transformative power of education.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that recognises this and values our universities. Where the previous coalition government actively undermined the sector, they oversaw the most amount of job losses the sector has ever seen, with estimates of around 12,000 jobs lost during the pandemic. In contrast, we've committed $485 million to fund an additional 20,000 university places in areas of skills shortages. These places have been specifically set aside to increase participation for underrepresented groups, those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds, regional students, students living with a disability, First Nations people and those who are the first in a family to study at university.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's more for us to do, and that work is currently underway with the Australian Universities Accord, a 12-month review of Australia's higher education system. Led by an expert independent panel, the accord will drive lasting and transformational reform in the higher education sector, because, on this side of the House, we want to make sure the doors of higher education and the doors of opportunity are open to all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, in this parliament, all know that energy bills continue to rise. Many Australians believe that the soaring prices they see in their energy bill tells the whole story when it comes to problems with Australia's energy system under the Albanese Labor government. I stand today to put forward this motion to put to the House that in fact the soaring prices don't tell the entire story when it comes to Australia's energy system. Indeed, there's another problem, a problem that is looming and that, until it hits, many Australians won't even know about it. That is the problem of reliability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prices—yes, we know. The government had promised that $275 reduction in household power bills, and we know very well that promise has been broken. No-one seriously believes that Labor can deliver on that promise. We know, through the news only a few weeks ago, that the default market offer is only going to increase even further. Already Australians have been paying hundreds of dollars more than what Labor had promised since they came to office, and, come 1 July, they will pay hundreds more. This is hurting families. We absolutely know that. That is why we will continue to hold the government to account. But, that bill, which says how much your prices have gone up, doesn't tell the full story, because the full story is told by the likes of the market operator, the ACCC and key industry leaders that have expressed a concern about us having a shortfall of energy into the future. In other words, a lot of us have heard of the discussions that, especially in the last winter, we had senior citizens having to make a choice between heating and eating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If, indeed, there is a full breakdown in reliability—not just price—senior citizens won't even have that choice. If, indeed, a shortfall comes to fruition and there are blackouts in our system, senior citizens, who maybe weigh up the choice of heating and eating, will not be able to turn on the stove to eat, to heat their spag bol or their soup, and they certainly won't be able to turn on their heater at home. Absolute blackouts are a genuine, present risk to our system at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Underlying this is Labor's suite of policies that will see an accelerated, premature closure of base-load power stations. Right now here in Canberra, part of the New South Wales NEM, you're probably looking at over 60 per cent of your electricity being supplied by coal-fired power stations. These are part of the base-load power system that we have in Australia at the moment. Eighty per cent—that's eight, zero; 80 per cent—of our base-load power will leave the grid by 2035—gone. Again, Australia is an island. We do not have cords connected elsewhere to import such electricity. If those base-load power stations are gone—entirely demolished and in many cases blown up—without a replacement there in time, we will have blackouts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those typically coal-fired base-load power stations are one thing. We already know, too, that this government is trying to kill off gas. The more you suffocate the supply of gas, the harder it gets. Then it comes to renewables. On the back of the coalition government, which delivered record investments in renewables, the first quarter of this year has seen no investment closures. No deals have been closed in the first quarter for any renewable generation project across the country. Renewable investment has nosedived under this government, regardless of their rhetoric. We are looking at a real problem if we have our base-load power stations, our gas and our renewables nosediving in this country, which is why they need to reinstate the capacity mechanism. They need to work with Origin on keeping Eraring up and running. And they need to make sure that they go to full gas— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I rise to speak against this private members' motion by the member for Fairfax. I do so as someone who actually lives in a coal region—who lives, works and has generations of family who have worked in coal and coal-fired power stations. The member for Fairfax would do well to get his facts right. It was the former Liberal government that spent 10 years putting their heads in the sand, attacking and blocking renewable energy and, indeed, every energy policy possible. They denied climate change even existed and refused to act on the urgent need for decarbonisation and diversification of our economy. After 22 attempts to land an energy policy in government, and failing every single time, going nuclear is now the only idea we get from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April, following the scheduled closure of the Liddell Power Station—and let's not forget: those opposite knew the closing dates of every single one of these coal-fired power stations while they were in government for 10 years and did nothing—the coalition rushed to the scene to announce their vision for the Hunter, with a proposal to go nuclear. That was their response. Indeed, they are proposing 80 small nuclear reactors around Australia, blind to the research that shows nuclear is too expensive, too inflexible and way too slow. The member for Fairfax is happy to spruik nuclear, but I am yet to meet anyone who wants a nuclear reactor next to their local school. Nuclear energy is not the future, so let's get real. Our community wants policy certainty and an investment in renewables, the cheapest and most reliable form of energy. Make no mistake: the former Liberal government abandoned the people of Newcastle and the Hunter, the regions that have powered Australia for generations, and all they had to say was, 'Nothing to see here.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, those days are over. The Albanese Labor government has a considered, coordinated plan to transform our energy system and broaden our industrial base. The 2023-23 budget provides an additional $4 billion to position Australia as a renewable energy superpower, taking our total investment in this ambition to more than $40 billion. We know Australia's biggest opportunity for growth and prosperity is the global shift to clean energy. It's good for the environment, good for power bills and good for jobs. We want to ensure that no-one is left behind; that that carbon-intensive regions—like Newcastle and the Hunter, which have powered Australia for generations—will continue to power us for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of inaction, we are getting on with the job. The Albanese Labor government are fixing the mess left behind by those opposite. We're establishing the Hydrogen Headstart initiative, a $2 billion budget measure to scale up large-scale green hydrogen in Australia. We're investing $1.9 billion in the Powering the Regions Fund to make sure traditional and new industries in regional Australia harness the economic opportunities of decarbonisation. We're putting $14.8 million into establishing the Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre to support local manufacturing of renewable energy technology. We're investing in offshore wind, including a proposed offshore wind zone for the Hunter region, an exciting opportunity for Newcastle to ensure large-scale, reliable and clean electricity for decades to come. We're investing a hundred million dollars to ensure hydrogen readiness at the port of Newcastle, supporting regions like ours to become a renewable energy superpower and meet our emissions reduction targets. We're investing $16 million to establish a new energy skills hub at the University of Newcastle. Our Powering Australia plan will deliver 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030, while our $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program will unlock investment in Australia's electricity grid and deliver more priority transition projects. This will grow and modernise our electricity grid and boost energy performance. We're legislating a national Net Zero Authority, we've got our energy price relief plan underway, we've made reforms to the safeguard mechanism to support industry and increase emissions efficiency while maintaining competitiveness in the global economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Newcastle, I know full well how important it is to be prepared as we move towards a decarbonised economy. The Albanese government have a considered, coordinated plan that will ensure Newcastle and the Hunter are poised to take full advantage of the new energy industries. We are going to do the job that was left to us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  This motion, moved by the member for Fairfax, is reality mugging people back into common sense. People have been notified their bill, if they're a householder, will rise by 30 per cent. That's for most of my region. For some of my small businesses, industrial users, it's absolutely business destroying. That's particularly because a lot of their energy systems are gas based. Their electricity and their gas prices, in some cases, have gone up 300 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is the plan. No-one using any rational engineering or economic analysis can, in truth, support it, but AEMO do. They are the architect of it. It is beyond belief that the regulator is encouraging the nation to commit economic harikari—no joke intended, because Kurri Kurri power plant is part of it—by, for instance, trying to build a power plant that runs on hydrogen when it was designed to run on gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of this plan is scary. Eighty per cent of our base-load power system is to be closed down—blown up—by 2035 without any equivalent replacement. We are going to have five times more rooftop solar. We're going to have nine times more wind farms. Part of the plan is that the number of batteries will increase 30 times, and that includes the virtual power plant. For listeners out there in Australia, the virtual power plant means your power plant—your Tesla or other electric car that's plugged into the grid. That's the power plant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of this plan is to build 28,000 kilometres of new transmission and distribution. But this doesn't just include things like VNI West, which is 820 kilometres through hundreds of thousands of hectares of remnant native forestry or pristine agricultural land that won't be able to be utilised fully, or the HumeLink, which is another 45,000 hectares. These new grids are going to isolated assets that can't connect to the grid, but they are insisting on being paid a regulated asset based return—a fixed return—as though they were being utilised all the time. But because they are renewable producers, they're only going to be carrying current between 20 per cent, if they're solar farms, or 35 per cent, on average, of a year. For a lot of the time, they will not carry any electrons anywhere. But, already, half your bill is accounted for by transmission costs. Your transmission costs on your bill won't be going up by these latest numbers of 30 per cent, which is outrageous; they'll be going up multiples of times. With the transmission costs and the costs of all these grids, which in all estimates have gone up 425 per cent in cost, building all this stuff is going to bankrupt us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of Melbourne, Princeton University and the University of Queensland have analysed this plan. They've copied what they did in America. In America, it was only going to take two states out of 50. But, for us to deploy all these solar farms and wind farms, it's going to use land equivalent to Victoria. The thing about this plan that's renewables dependant is that all the renewables that have been installed in Australia for the last 23 years—guess what—are just about at the end of their lives. Not only have we got to do all this extra stuff out to 2030 or 2050; you're also going to have to reinstall everything that's already been installed. It is never-ending building and consuming land. All these renewables are great when you can get them, but you can't build a grid and an industrial system on them. Once you get to about the level that we are, we are going exponentially to a very brittle grid because of poor frequency and voltage control. Without any physical inertia, because of the development of harmonic circuits, which is malignant to big machines working, we will have blackouts, even though there's electricity in the wires. It's an engineering disaster, an economic disaster, an environmental disaster and an agricultural disaster. The last thing in this plan is that all we need to do is reforest six million hectares of agricultural pasture land. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak to the member for Fairfax's motion. There isn't a great deal of the member's motion that's grounded in the reality of energy policy as it has played out in this country over the last ten years. Allow me to run through a brief history lesson as to how we got to this current situation. First, I want to acknowledge that this government understands and is aware of the immense pressure that rising energy prices have on Australians—on families, on households and on businesses. In fact, thanks to the member for Fairfax, we've had plenty of opportunities to outline what the government is doing on energy prices. Just last week, on Thursday, in the House of Representatives, I spoke to a matter of public importance moved by the member for Fairfax on this very topic. I'll take the opportunity to once again outline the facts when it comes to energy policy in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are currently dealing with the most significant shock to energy markets in 50 years due to Russia's prolonged attack on Ukraine. Those opposite know full well that the major cause of energy price increases is the illegal war in Ukraine. Why would events on the other side of the world impact us here in Australia? That's because our energy market is exposed to international prices. Arguably, as an energy-producing country, we should not be exposed to international prices. After 22 failed energy plans under those opposite, you would think that we would have an energy market that works for Australians. But they didn't address this issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people also remember that the former energy minister, the member for Hume, deliberately hid rising energy costs so that they were not released until after last year's election. We now know that the member for Hume actually amended the industry code for electricity retailers on 7 April last year. Is that a really big coincidence? That was three days before the election was called, and he deliberately hid energy price rises from Australian voters until after the election. It's really hard to contemplate how anyone thought this was a justifiable or ethical course of action. But those opposite and the truth are strangers when it comes to energy prices. In May 2019, they promised to deliver an average energy wholesale price of $70 per megawatt hour by the end of 2021. Instead, by the time of the election in May 2022, the price was $286.18. They promised a 25 per cent discount, but they delivered a 240 per cent increase over three years. And yet they propose motions like these.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might find it easier to accept the concern of those opposite regarding higher energy prices if, when given the opportunity to support something that would ease the pressure of those higher prices on Australians, they had done something about them. They didn't do anything to establish a reliable and strategic energy policy and framework in their decade in government. Now they propose nuclear energy as the answer—the most expensive form of energy, which would take a decade and more to establish—but they did nothing about it either, when they were in government. Late last year, when this government recalled parliament to legislate to deliver urgent energy price relief, how did those opposite respond? They voted against energy price relief for Australians. Remarkable!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can now see that the final default market offer, the DMO, confirms that the Albanese government has limited the worst of the energy price spikes while investing in a long-term plan to get cheaper, cleaner energy for all Australians. Set by the Australian Energy Regulator, the DMO is the price that electricity retailers can charge customers, including in my home state of South Australia, on standard offers from 1 July 2023. It also serves as a benchmark for all electricity offers. Due to the government's electricity price intervention in December last year, the DMO increase is up to 27 percentage points lower in South Australia than it would otherwise have been, according to the Australian Energy Regulator. The increases in DMO prices are up to $492 lower than they would have been without the government's intervention for residential customers and up to $1,310 lower than they would have been for small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know people are doing it tough, but this government is doing everything it possibly can to help. Unlike those opposite, who, when given the opportunity, voted against energy price relief, the people of Boothby and the people of Australia aren't stupid. They won't forget that. We won't forget a wasted decade, and we don't have time to waste now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I stand today to speak in support of this motion brought by the member for Fairfax. I thank him for bringing this motion that brings to this House's attention the failure of the Albanese Labor government, and especially Minister Bowen, to ensure that a plan is in place as we transition Australia through new technologies to a net zero emission economy and world. On this side, we are committed to net zero but to achieving it through principles of liberalism—using the market economy and encouraging and incentivising entrepreneurial innovations to enable us to successfully transition to new energy sources. This means, however, that we must put consumers at the centre. We must put Australian families, Australian individuals and Australian small businesses at the centre as we transition. Pragmatism must replace ideology. Policy should be informed by economics and engineering. Renewables and nuclear can play complementary roles in a hybrid system. These are the two main options for low-carbon energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was formally an environmental lawyer. I have always been committed to Australia moving towards net zero. To that end, I have manufacturers within my electorate that manufacture solar panels, and I recently went out to the Western Sydney Green Hydrogen Hub at Horsley Park to see what they're doing out there in the way of new hydrogen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have two options for low-carbon energy. At the moment, the government has not put forward any plan to address and look at something—nuclear energy—that could potentially help us to address the current and future energy crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both nuclear and renewables generate energy that produce no green house gas emissions, reduce air pollution, diversify the energy supply and reduce dependence on imported and fossil fuels. Due to Australia's natural abundance of sunshine and wind, there's widespread political, institutional and corporate support to underwrite technologies, projects and investments in the renewable sector. This is appropriate, and it is something that I've always supported—that we transition and use renewables but in a far greater capacity than we have done in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear technologies could potentially help us to address this energy crisis as well. However, due to the intractability of Labor and others in this place to even consider the potential that nuclear technologies could deliver to address our current and future energy needs, we are seeing a situation where the government has us trying to get off the boat before we are at the wharf.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there is still concern throughout some parts of Australia about nuclear, particularly when there have been some disasters in other parts of the world. However, as I said in my first speech in this place, my 15-year-old self, who wore 'No nuclear' T-shirts and had photos and posters of Peter Garrett and Midnight Oil throughout my bedroom, would acknowledge now that the nuclear of the 21st century is very different to the nuclear of the past.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We owe it to the Australians that elected us into this place to address some of the biggest challenges that arise for us today, and that has to be to ensure that Australians—Australian families, Australian businesses—have access to affordable and reliable electricity. To do anything less than that is a travesty.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring our energy supply is also a very important part of our national defence and the entire security of our citizens. Therefore, I support this motion brought by the member for Fairfax. I thank him for his advocacy on various other ways and other technologies where we can look at addressing how we retain affordable and reliable energy for Australians as we transition to a net zero world using new technologies.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  It's a real pleasure to once again be speaking on a debate brought to us by the member for Fairfax—we obviously had the MPI last Thursday. It's good to be here again talking about these issues. I am grateful to the member for Fairfax for providing yet another opportunity to talk about how our government is taking responsible action when it comes to the energy future of this country, while those opposite spend their time living in some kind of fantasy land, because it seems that rather than using their time in opposition to reflect—to think about what they didn't do over the last decade, what should the future of this country be, how do they deal with the very real challenges our country is facing, to get up to speed with where the Australian people are, and where the experts are when it comes to energy, climate, renewables in this place—instead, what we have is the person, who the Liberals and The Nationals would have serve as their Minister for Energy and Climate Change, is often away talking about how great nuclear power is and is joined by many of his colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does seem that for many of those opposite they do see nuclear power as their ticket back to government, but, I have to say, it doesn't seem like there are many other people out there who are with them on that ticket. In fact, I think it was the former Liberal minister for energy in New South Wales who said about nuclear power:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">people talking about nuclear as an asset to our energy challenges right now are literally chasing unicorns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that that is what we are actually debating at the moment—starting down the path of wanting to introduce the most expensive and probably, for our country, the slowest form of energy to roll out in this country. That's what all the experts tell us. They tell us that this is not the option for our country. The option, as we move and as we transform, is a renewable one. That is certainly what our government is doing. Again, I note that one of the reasons that nuclear is not the option—and certainly the experts tell us this—is that we don't have an existing industry in this country. It's certainly not something that those opposite did anything about in their decade of denial and drift. I've lost count of how many energy policies they did actually bring forward in that decade. I don't think that they landed any of them, though, and that is why our country is in the position we are in, where we are behind on the transformation we should be making to a cleaner, greener renewable-powered future. But we are now in the situation where we have a government in office who 'get' it, who understand that that is our future and who are working as hard as we can, as fast as we can, to make that happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite know that they were wrong to vote against our government's Energy Price Relief Plan, which we put in place late last year. We do know that energy prices are a real concern. We do know that cost-of-living pressures are a very real thing for many people in our communities. As a government, we want to do all we can to support those people while also making sure that we don't do anything to add to the very real inflationary pressures Australia is facing—that we know countries around the world are facing at the moment—and while we face the issue of energy prices being affected by the war in Ukraine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the experts, again, have said that the work our government did last year, through our energy relief plan, has helped to keep prices lower than they otherwise would've been. The facts are these. The increases in default market offer prices are now up to $492 less for residential customers than they would have been without our government's intervention and up to $1,310 less for small businesses than they would've been otherwise. It seems that if those opposite had their way they would rip up this intervention that our government introduced. It seems like they would rather see unconstrained increases happen than step in to take the pressure off Australian households. They'd rather hitch their wagon to some kind of unicorn future with nuclear power than do the work here and now to get Australians' cheaper electricity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, our government is not operating in a fantasy land. We are and we always will be upfront with the Australian people about the challenges and the opportunities we have. We know that Australian people get that. They don't want to be left in the dark. They don't want to live in a fantasy land. They want a government that understands that there is a genuine future for us, that there is a future where we are a renewable energy superpower. They want a government that is doing everything we can to harness the jobs, the opportunity and the future from that, and that is certainly what they are getting with the Albanese Labor government. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  The Albanese Labor government is making a complete and utter mess of the energy transition that this nation is undertaking, and it is the Australian people who are going to pay as a consequence. There is no plan to their transition, and I support the shadow minister for climate change and energy, who's here with us today, in calling that out in this motion. They have no plan for energy. It's not only no plan for energy but also it's no plan with a broken promise, a clear and utter broken promise. Your power bill was meant to go down by $275. Now the Australian people will be lucky if their power bill doesn't go up by more than $1,000 under this government. It is a clear and utter breach of an election commitment, and they have no plan—no plan whatsoever—to fix it. We see what is happening with base-load power in this country. It is shutting down, and there is nothing to replace it with. That is what a transition is all about. There is nothing to replace it with, and worse, it is ideologically driven. It is not technology agnostic; it is ideologically driven. Do you know the worst thing about it? </span>

                  </a>  And I get interjections from the other side. The worst thing about it is they want others to pay the cost for their ideologically driven approach. And people are paying the cost. As I've mentioned, they're paying the cost through their energy bills. But they're also paying the cost because industry are facing higher electricity costs and higher gas costs, and that means that their financial pressures are getting harder and harder. So we're seeing that it's not only households but businesses that are paying the costs. Not only that, it is also rural and regional Australia. I point you to my electorate, where now we are seeing wind companies coming in without even bothering to consult local communities and planning wind farms.</span>

Could you imagine having someone come in to your community and say to you, 'We are going to do this, and we don't care whether you like it or not'—trying to do it without a social licence? I get people shaking their heads, but could you imagine a city electorate where someone came in and said, 'Oh, we want to put a 30-storey building in your suburb.' How do you think that would go down? People would riot. We now have people coming in trying to do this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only the fact that there is no consultation with local communities; it's worse than that. There is no benefit that accrues to local communities. Moyne shire, in my electorate, probably hosts more wind farms than any other shire in the country. Do you know that not one household has benefited as a result of cheaper electricity, even though they probably host more wind farms than anywhere in the country? How is that fair? We have a wind farm at the moment where the consultation of the proposal has been so poor that we have local Indigenous leaders saying: 'Where is the consultation?' Why isn't the company coming to us and saying: 'Where is the social licence for what you're doing? How can we do it?' None of this is occurring. Not only that—not only are we seeing the wind projects going in and industrialising the landscape—there are transmission lines going in as well, which is making a bad situation worse. People in the cities can shake their heads, but just imagine if high-rise developments were going into your suburbs— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  What we're experiencing today is yet another episode in what I would only describe as a cynical sloganeering effort. There are really two different types of slogans that we've experienced today. The first one we heard for quite a bit in the previous speech. We used to hear three-word slogans a decade ago from the opposition, and now it has been reduced to two words: 'no plan'. But the irony of this, and the immediate rebuttal of it, is in their own speech, whereby they say that there's no plan and then spend their entire speech trying to critique all the various things that we're doing in our plan. So I just want to get that one out of the way from the outset. Those opposite rail on with great outrage at all of the different things we're doing and say how terrible they are. You can't say that and at the same time say that there's no action and there's no plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the second element—in fact, the more disturbing one, because it reflects where they're really coming from intellectually—comes from a quote from the Leader of the Opposition where he said, 'Just like Reagan, we will wind back government intervention.' That's what reflects where they're really coming from, because they oppose every step of the way all of the things that we're doing. They come into this parliament and say: 'Of course we support action on climate change. Of course we support everything we can do to support the transition and investment.' They say that time and time again, when they did nothing for a decade, and yet they vote against or carp about every single measure we put in place. If given the reins of power again, they really will wind back all of the things that we have done over the last year—things that were so overdue and things that are already making a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the earlier speakers said no-one with an engineering background or who claims to be economically rational could support the things that the government is doing, things like setting long-term targets for investors, things like strengthening the safeguard mechanism or things like putting in place a capacity mechanism. I could line up almost every Nobel Prize winner in economics over the last 50 years talking about exactly these kinds of sensible, rational market interventions. I could talk about just about all the regulators of utilities, both in Australia and around the world, who, time and time again, stand up and support the kinds of policies that we are putting out.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, it's the very opposite. When things like the safeguard mechanism come into the public for debate, it's the regulators, the economists, the public policy think tanks and, in fact, the business community that all line up and support those measures. When the safeguard mechanism was brought for debate in this place, each of us had any number of stakeholders from all of those realms. I could line up the economists. I could line up the regulators. One of my earliest jobs was working in an economic regulator of utility networks. I could line up all the people who could talk about externalities and the need for regulation and about the fact that you need to put in place the right regulatory mechanisms to encourage long-term investment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could talk about the fact that the Business Council of Australia, Australian Industry Group—all these groups' members, leaders, CEOs and directors are having to make long-term decisions based upon a world in which climate risk is rising. All of these people came out. They support setting long-term targets. They support strengthening the safeguard mechanism. They support the capacity mechanism. Those opposite claim, 'Nobody supports what they're doing, and we're going to want it back,' as if that's a panacea. Then, in an intellectually dishonest way, they conflate price rises that are clearly coming from the illegal and immoral war in Ukraine with things that this government is doing, which are in fact starting to solve a problem which had laid untested and unsolved for a long decade. Those opposite have in fact laid bare their true position. They will wind back all of those things that the government has done which are having such a positive impact. That's why what they're suggesting is so dangerous. Then, as earlier speakers have said, we did face a short-term spike as a result of the war in Ukraine, and this government put in place short-term price caps and compensation for households.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Secretary to the Treasury said that the most significant element of the package is the Energy Price Relief Plan, which is projected to reduce headline inflation by three-quarters of a percentage point. Clare Savage, on multiple occasions, has said that it put a significant downward pressure on prices. Those opposite clearly give some kind of dishonest support to some of the elements of our package, but it's very clear they will unwind things which are working, which are necessary and which are long overdue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  One of the most important gifts we can give our children is a good education, and I'm so proud of the wonderful work done by schools across Wentworth. Over the past few weeks I've had the pleasure of speaking with around 50 students from Wentworth as part of my primary and secondary school forums. We discussed what it's like to be a politician, the characteristics of good leadership, and what matters most to young people in Wentworth. The biggest issue the senior school students raised was mental health. They talked about the long-term impacts of COVID, the cultural stigma associated with being vulnerable, the damaging yet sometimes supportive spaces created by social media, struggles with eating disorders, as well as the costs and difficulty in getting treatment. And we discussed how the solutions to our mental health challenges are federal but also very personal, that sometimes the biggest difference you can make is just to remind someone, 'I'm your friend; I'm here for you; let's go out to the movies,' as one young man suggested. We also discussed how important it is to focus on the causes of mental health issues as well as how to support each other through this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would really like to thank all the schools who took part—a wide range of schools, including Reddam House, Cranbrook, Scots, Ascham, St Clare's, WAYS, Kambala, Waverley College, Sydney Girls High School, Rose Bay Public, Moriah, Double Bay Public, McAuley Catholic, Bronte Public, Paddington Catholic, Vaucluse Public, St Catherine's, St Francis of Assisi, and Galilee. Thank you so much.</span>

And as the vote in the Senate today shows, with the Greens, the Liberals and the Nationals combining to block the passage of our $10 billion housing fund, we just can't wait for them to act in the best interests of the country. So, we're delivering. We're not waiting for them. We're delivering more than $610 million to New South Wales to immediately begin boosting social housing stock. This is part of the $2 billion social housing fund accelerator payment, with the funds coming to New South Wales and all the other states within the next two weeks. We're able to do it because we brought down a responsible budget, and we're not prepared to stop working on tackling this very important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New South Wales will have flexibility in how they permanently boost social housing stock, including through new builds, expansion of existing programs, and renovation or refurbishment of existing but currently uninhabitable housing stock. It means that people who are on social housing waiting lists will have a shorter wait as we increase that housing supply sooner, and all the funds will need to be expended within two years. We know Australians want practical solutions. To date in this financial year we've invested $9.5 billion to provide practical solutions to increase housing supply.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  For months now the Labor government has told us that there was no money for direct spending on housing. Well, over the weekend it was revealed that that was a lie. They announced $2 billion in new housing spending. This has come about only because of the sustained pressure from the Greens and the enormous on-the-ground effort of more than 500 volunteers. To each and every person who gave up a weekend afternoon to go and knock on a stranger's door, you did this. This is your victory. It would not have happened without the mammoth effort and the confidence it has given us that everyday people are on our side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fight isn't over. This backflip from the government shows that the government can in fact fund things when it wants to, it can directly invest billions in housing whenever it wants, and it can coordinate a national freeze on rents. We still have a shortage of 640,000 social and affordable homes. A $2 billion one-off spend will not begin to tackle this waiting list. We need a real commitment for direct spending every year. Millions of renters in this country are one rent increase away from eviction. This is a crisis, and we need a crisis-level response. If we can do it during the pandemic, we can do it now.</span>

I want to congratulate the creatives group on their first place at the local Ipswich Show for their impressive pulled thread work, and also the gardening enthusiasts for the work they do, particularly in the flourishing community garden where residents can pick up fresh produce produced by their neighbours and friends. It's an important organisation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  My electorate of Mackellar is home to Australia's only Baha'i house of worship, one of just 13 Baha'i temples around the world. It is a majestic symbol of unity and an icon of our electorate that we are incredibly proud of. Yesterday, 18 June 2023, I was honoured to take part in a commemoration to mark 40 years since the Islamic Republic of Iran executed 10 Baha'i women in a single night in a square in the city of Shiraz. Their crime was refusing to renounce their belief in the Baha'i faith—a faith that promotes the principles of gender equality, unity, justice and truth. The women were hanged one by one, each forced to watch the next woman's death, in a harrowing attempt to coerce them into recanting their faith. Most were in their 20s, and one was only 17. Human rights groups and ordinary citizens around the world were horrified and outraged at this barbaric act.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the execution of the 10 women and over the ensuing four decades, hundreds more Baha'i women have been severely persecuted, facing discrimination both as women and as Baha'is. The persecution continues to this day under the current Iranian regime. Today, I rise to honour and recognise not only the courage of the 10 Baha'i women of Shiraz but also women across Iran. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

All three students demonstrated great awareness of our national flags and understanding of Australian civics. Following on from an email to my office from Avoca Public, I was made aware that its Australian flag had fallen into disrepair and needed replacing. The school had also requested new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags, and, of course, I was more than happy to make a visit and provide the new flags. When I arrived, I was greeted by Zaiden, Felix and Sienna as well as Assistant Principal Roxanne Davies. We then toured the school and discussed what the colours and symbols on each of the flags represented.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was so good to hear the students discuss their knowledge of our three flags and talk about all the civics education they are undertaking at Avoca Beach Public School. It was also quite the honour to help hoist the new Australian flag onto the school's flagpole. To Zaiden, Felix and Sienna: I wish you success as you transition to high school at the end of this year. Know that education is key to unlocking life's opportunities, so make sure that you study hard. To Assistant Principal Roxanne: thank you for inviting me to your beautiful Avoca Beach Public School and for your work in education on the Central Coast.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Congratulations to a young man from Wide Bay, Jake Henry-May, who won a coveted place in the Australian Federal Police Forensics Work Experience Program. More than a thousand students applied to get into the week-long intensive course, and Jake was one of only 30, nationwide, to earn a spot. Jake attended a crime scene scenario, investigating and solving a mock crime, and gave evidence in a mock court. He got opportunities that a 16-year-old could only dream of: working in ballistics, including handling an AK-47, and fingerprinting suspects, while learning from the AFP forensic specialists in a laboratory and in the field. The experience, which gave Jake access to all of the AFP's forensic capabilities, cemented his plan to study science and specialise in forensics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Offering this unique opportunity to all students across Australia—not just those lucky enough to be geographically close to the AFP—means kids win this experience based on merit, not on their address. I thank the AFP for recognising our smart regional kids, no matter where they live, and inspiring the next generation of forensic investigators. And I say to Jake: whether it's serving the community in policing or whatever you choose to do, go for it, mate!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Last week, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that 76,000 jobs were added to the economy last month. That same report showed unemployment dropping to just 3.6 per cent, which is only slightly higher than the 48-year low of 3.4 per cent set by the Albanese government in October 2022. This comes alongside data from Treasury showing that 465,000 new jobs were created between May 2022 and May 2023. To put that in perspective, that's the strongest jobs growth of any first-year government on record. That comes on top of the first budget surplus in 15 years, from our May 2023 budget. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first year of this government, we've reminded Australians why Labor are the superior economic managers. Those opposite will wheel out the same talking points about 'jobs, jobs, jobs' and 'jobs and growth' without actually ever having delivered a surplus or without having delivered strong jobs growth, like we've seen in the first year of the Albanese government. Australians deserve better. Australians deserve a future with more jobs for more Australians, and these latest stats show just that. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Little Grubbs Orchard in Southport do fantastic work to support children and families impacted by neurodevelopmental conditions, disabilities, special needs or behavioural issues. When the son of director, Lily Grubb, was diagnosed with autism at age three, her family found there weren't many support services available. Fortunately, for Moncrieff residents, Lily started Little Grubbs Orchard to ensure that other families in similar circumstances had access to support services and weren't left behind. One of the special things about Little Grubbs Orchard is that there's no age limit. Children can continue to attend and receive support into their schooling years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I revisited Little Grubbs Orchard a few weeks ago for afternoon tea and to see their newly expanded premises—which is a much-needed expansion, might I add. During the visit, the team surprised me with a saxophone. For any in the Chamber that are unaware, I was a professional saxophonist for 35 years. So it was a bit of a surprise when they opened up the case. I really enjoyed playing the 'Pink Panther' theme and 'Mary had a Little Lamb' to the children, and they had a go on the sax themselves. It was great fun to give them a lesson. I'm always impressed by the work of Miss Lily and her team of behavioural therapists. They provide much love, care and support for the children and their families. Their passion and love for the job is on display. Little Grubbs Orchard is truly life changing for children with neurodevelopmental conditions, disability, special needs or behavioural issues. Thank you for all you do, Lily Grubb.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  After 190 days, 120,000 innocent civilians remain under siege without access to food, supplies, humanitarian relief, gas and internet. This is the day-to-day reality for the people of Artsakh. It is the grim reality for 9,000 people living a disability, 20,000 elderly civilians and 30,000 children who call this democratic state their home. This is a humanitarian crisis that the International Association of Genocide Scholars is now calling a risk of genocide, as a result of Azerbaijan's blockade on this entire region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the International Court of Justice has ordered provisional measures demanding Azerbaijan open the corridor. Specifically, I acknowledge Australian judge Hilary Charlesworth, a member of the ICJ, who took a principled stance and voted in favour of this measure, with the hope of ending the humanitarian crisis. It is a position I know many in my electorate of Bennelong have welcomed and one they hope that the Azerbaijan government will also echo. It's time for that regime to listen to calls from across the world and end this blockade. Should countries fail to abide by such well-respected institutions, they threaten the democratic values and internationally accepted human rights we as a nation have fought so hard to defend. So today I stand with my community of Australian Armenians in Bennelong praying for an immediate end to this blockade and pledge to continue to raise awareness on this issue within government.</span>

Across Barker, 11 outstanding citizens were acknowledged last week as part of the King's Birthday honours, the first under our new monarch. I speak in this place often about the amazing people that make the communities of Barker some of the best places to live, work and raise a family anywhere in the country. Eleven of the almost 1,200 King's Birthday honours nationwide came out of the electorate, so we're certainly punching above our weight.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were awarded to people such as Marilyn Pattison of Tanunda, for distinguished service to occupational therapy; Dawn Borchardt, for significant service to youth through Girl Guiding; John Camillo, for significant service in industrial relations in the manufacturing industry; Michael Bakker, for services to secondary education; William Barrows, for services to motorsport; Sid Hosking, for services to baseball; Brenton Lewis, for services to the community of Murray Bridge; Ken McInerney, for services to local government and the community in Bordertown; Barry Sharrad, for services to the community of Pinnaroo; Ken Wells, for services to the community of Murray Bridge; and Maureen Christie, for significant services in and around wildlife conservation. Congratulations to all who have been acknowledged for their significant contribution to the local community and our nation, much of which was via volunteer work. Barker and indeed our nation are richer and stronger for your contributions.</span>

This devotion to our national pastime has been reflected in this years King's Birthday honours. Devonport's Roger Blake has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his unwavering dedication to the Devonport Warriors Basketball Club and the North West Basketball Union. Latrobe's Noel Pearce has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his six decades of service to cycling and community sport. Phil Thomas has been awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his 60 years of service to basketball, through playing, coaching and administration. In the area of the performing arts, Burnie is home to Australia's queen of country music, Jean Stafford, who has received the Medal of the Order of Australia for her 58 years of service to the country music industry. Joan Kelly was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her services to the visual arts. For services to local government and the community, former West Coast mayor Phil Vickers has received the Medal of the Order of Australia. To each and every one of you, for your selfless dedication and service to our region, I say thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These humble Canberrans were largely caught off guard by this recognition. They have made, and continue to make, substantial contributions to our community. Some are volunteers; others have had a remarkable impact in professional roles; many have done both. All of them have something in common—people recognise the difference they have made to their community and country. I urge those in the community to take the time and nominate someone whom they believe has made a significant contribution. These extraordinary recipients would not have been recognised last week, and today, if it were not for the gesture of a friend, colleague or collaborator in submitting a nomination.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  Calvary hospital here in Canberra is a long way from my electorate in South-East Queensland but the future of that hospital and the outrageous decision of the ACT government to compulsorily acquire it have triggered an avalanche of correspondence from locals in my electorate who are extremely worried about what this means for the future of private institutions across the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACT government has announced its intention to compulsorily acquire the Catholic-run Calvary hospital and take over its operations as early as July this year. Calvary has been operating the hospital since 1979 and had 76 years left on its contract before the ACT government's sudden announcement. If a territory government can effectively nationalise a successful private institution, what is to stop them doing it to any Christian school, aged-care facility or welfare agency? If the Labor government can do this in the ACT, with the support of the Prime Minister, what's to stop them doing it in my home state of Queensland?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter from Thornlands described the move as an 'authoritarian land grab'. Stephen from Ormiston wrote, 'What amazes me is that a government thinks it can shove anyone aside that stands in its way.' A resident of Russell Island emailed me to say, 'This is a clear act of religious discrimination.' Christine from Thornlands outlined in an email to me that it sets 'a dangerous and unsettling precedent for every faith based school, aged-care provider or social welfare service'. I couldn't agree more with these comments of my constituents.</span>

It's Queensland versus New South Wales on Wednesday night. But it's not the biggest game in town. The big game is at 6.50 pm tonight at the Brothers Social Touch Football Club, where we'll see the McHugh Steel team—my team—take on Livingstone Low Electrical in the over-35s grand final. I want to wish the team all the best. They are absolutely seeing the benefit of me not being there! As you all know, in this part of the season it's very difficult to make any Monday night game. In fact, I only made two for whole team, which I know is a poor excuse. But I want to shout out my best wishes to the side, and I want to thank Rob McHugh, who is the team sponsor through McHugh Steel, and the captain Mick Castelli, who I've had the great fortune of competing with and, on very rare occasions, against since the 1980s at local, state and national levels. I'm sure that they will absolutely do them proud.</span>

It was a knockout, as you could expect, and I hope that they put on a very good turnout tonight. Tomorrow morning, for all those who might be watching in the House, it is State of Origin with the NRL, at 7.00 am. Members and senators, it's Queensland versus New South Wales. Come on, the Queenslanders!</span>

Hunter Valley Flooring Xtra, who are based in Cessnock, took out the trades and industry category; McCaffrey's Estate in Pokolbin won the hospitality and tourism category; Bryan Hampton from Vintage Connections won the customer service award in the individual category for the wonderful work he does showing visitors the beautiful vineyards and wineries in the Hunter; Scott Player from Hunter Health Insurance in Cessnock also won business leader of the year. I also want to give a special mention to LJ Hooker Cessnock, who were highly commended in the financial and real estate service category. Vines Restaurant at Hollydene Estate and Hollydene Estate Wines from Jerrys Plains were highly commended in the hospitality and tourism sector. Saddler's Creek Wines in Pokolbin were highly commended in the business customer service category.</span>

I want to put on the record that I am so incredibly proud of all the headspace centres around Durack. Since 2006 headspace has been providing early-intervention mental health services to our young 12-to-25-year-old Australians. We're all very proud of the work they do. Just recently I was particularly proud, as I've just had two new centres open. The first one is in Hedland, and unfortunately I couldn't attend the opening, but I did have the chance to visit them two days before their official opening. On that day, I met Arshani, Jess, Phyliss, Jess and Marissa. It is a beautiful, welcoming space, and I just want to give a shout-out to the youth advisory group who helped them with the design of the new headspace. It is really wonderful, and they made me feel so welcome. On 8 June, I had the opportunity to attend the Karratha headspace opening. I want to give a shout-out to Charlene, her team and her fabulous youth advisory group, who put together this most wonderful, entertaining and inclusive official opening. It was incredibly grand, and I want to thank them very much. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to do with headspace in the Pilbara. Six years ago, I made a very big point of saying that we cannot just build a bricks-and-mortar space; we need more of an outreach program. That's what we committed to do. It took six years, we did the outreach and, from that outreach, we were able to determine the type of service that we needed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  It's often said that how a society treats its most vulnerable is a true measure of its humanity. This Refugee Week, these words have never been more true as we celebrate the contributions of the nearly one million Australians who have settled here since World War II as refugees. These are people who fled unimaginable lives of war and persecution to become part of our Australian community and contribute and give back to our diverse social fabric. One of the things that drives me most nuts is that stereotype that people come here just to get on Centrelink. In the year 2000, six of our country's eight billionaires at the time had arrived as refugees. The fact is that refugees are far more likely than other Australians to start a business; they're incredibly entrepreneurial.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 2,000 people seeking asylum and refugees live in my community—well over 2,000; I've lost count. We're the most multicultural part of Australia in Greater Dandenong, with people from 157 countries, two thirds of our population born overseas and most people not speaking English at home. It's a microcosm of modern multicultural Australia—harmonious, inclusive, welcoming and generous. The people with the least are always the people who give the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to creating a new national conversation, one with generosity and inclusivity about refugees and asylum seekers, not stoking division; one anchored in compassion rather than fear. The stories of refugees must be heard, and I'm incredibly pleased that, for the first time in years, the government will meet and fill the annual refugee quota this year.</span>

Like all good companies, Nyrstar recognises that the strength of their success is in the quality of their workers, and there's nothing like longevity to give a good understanding of the place. The people that have achieved 10 years, 25 years, 40 and 45 years of service were all recognised on the night. Because the list of those with 10 years of service is a bit long, I will stick to the 40s and 45s. Craig Roberts, Michael Swaerse, David Court, David Young and Dennis Buchanan were marked with 40 years of service. Wayne Harding, Paul Nieass and Jeff Rawlins had 45 years of service. Some of them talked about the changes that have come into the smelting industry over that time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth pointing out that the smelters in Port Pirie have been there 130 years, and the Broken Hill associated smelters were the beginning of BHP, so in a way it's the birthplace of BHP. They currently employ 1,350 people. They contributed $1.76 billion to the Australian economy last year, and spent $839 million back in the economy. So they are exemplary employers, and I thank those people who give that long-term service to their community and to the company.</span>

It was beautiful to see people from all walks of life and all over the Territory come together to celebrate Aboriginal sports, culture and heritage. White fellas, black fellas, the multicultural community, old people, young people—everybody came together to pay their respects and have a good time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barunga is a place of deep history in the Territory and indeed for the nation. Thirty-five years ago the Northern Land Council and Central Land Council presented the Barunga Statement to then Prime Minister Bob Hawke. I was humbled to sit in the community with the Minister for Indigenous Australians and Assistant Minister Senator McCarthy to listen to over 200 elected representatives of Aboriginal communities that came together to endorse the Voice.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of our land council representatives for their vote of confidence in the Voice and for their tireless advocacy for our grassroots communities. It was one of those moments that send shivers down your spine—the opportunity to be part of history in the making. This year, all Australians have the opportunity to make history. We have the chance to vote yes for the recognition and respect of First Nations people. Let's not miss this opportunity, Australia.</span>

A report from Energy Consumers Australia says that businesses in the state of South Australia, on average, have the highest electricity costs in the nation; the average bill is $8½ thousand. So of all the jurisdictions, we're the best when it comes to expensive electricity for businesses. What an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that same report covered gas costs. Who had the highest increase? Well, my home state of South Australia topped the list once again, with a more than 22 per cent increase on the average gas bill for the average business in South Australia. It's an interesting figure, 22 per cent, because in Labor's budget last October they predicted gas prices would go up by 20 per cent over the next 12 months. Then they undertook that—apparently—emergency legislation to intervene in the gas market because they didn't want to see gas prices go up by 20 per cent. They were successful in that, because they went up by 22 per cent in the state of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses in my home state are paying the highest electricity prices and the highest gas prices under this government. What is their response? It's absolute crickets. All we're seeing is them saying that we should be grateful that prices aren't going up even further. Good luck selling that message to the average business in my home state of South Australia!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Last month I had the privilege of visiting Ngala, which is a great not-for-profit in my electorate. They provide support for families and parents to become the best versions of themselves. Ngala delivers a number of services including a parenting hotline from 8 am to 8 pm to help parents talk about issues that they're facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mum, I know that parenting is a tough job. In some ways, it's much tougher than the work we do in this place. Children, particularly newborns, are demanding at all hours of the day. It's not a nine-to-five job. There's little training, and often you can be running on little to no sleep. So Ngala also has a residential service program which gives support to parents in a nurturing environment through either a day stay or a stay of a few days. This can make a transformational difference to both the confidence of parents and the wellbeing of these children and babies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, the name 'Ngala' was chosen from the Noongar language of WA and refers to the symbiosis between parents and children and the duality of the way that they survive together. The thing that's also interesting about Ngala is that, for my first child, I had the opportunity to have my mothers group in their premises in Kensington. They also have childcare services, and they continue to do wonderful work not only in the communities of Swan but also across all of Western Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  You might call me a frustrated speaker or a frustrated teacher, but I love and relish every opportunity to get out into my electorate and talk to schools about civics. We are an incredible country. We are so lucky to live in Australia. I love talking to school students about our system of government, our system of politics and law. In the last month alone, I have faced my own question time and presented flags to students at Caloundra Christian College, Talara Primary College, Siena Catholic Primary School and Glenview State School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that our teachers work really hard and have a crammed syllabus, so this is no criticism of them, but our kids get such a small window of opportunity to learn about civics in this country. Is it any wonder that, as they become adults, they really don't understand our system of government? So, to teachers in schools in my electorate and across the country, I say: call upon your federal MPs, ask them to come in and talk to your students, and help them to help teach you and the kids about the civics that we have in this country. You won't regret it. It will be great for the kids.</span>

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Fairfield Liverpool Cricket Association. The association has published an informative book, recognising all executive positions, longest-serving members and player statistics. The FLCA has had four cricketers represent Australia—Steve Smith, Michael Clarke, Jason Krejza and Ben Rohrer—along with others who have represented at state levels.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The book was launched at the senior presentation with Kerry O'Keeffe, the former Australian cricketer and spinner, as speaker. For me as a cricket tragic, it was a wonderful night to listen to Mr O'Keeffe's insights for the upcoming games in England. I thank the President and Secretary, Peter Moore, Sharjeel Siddiqui, Anthony Ferraro and the board of the FLCA for the invitation.</span>

This year's junior cricketers have broken successive club records. Prestons Hornets Cricket Club has been in existence for over 50 years, and is currently ably led by David Millot and Shane McNamara. I'm pleased to say that my family has had a long association with the Prestons Hornets Cricket Club, and their volunteers are second to none for what they do for the children, boys and girls, in our community who want to play cricket.</span>

I'm blessed to represent such an amazing area. A few weeks ago, I got to visit the Yarra Valley Annual Tourism Summit. It was a great summit and a great day, run by Simon, Leigh and the team there. It was wonderful to see so many different hospitality and tourism businesses there talking about the opportunities in the industry. I recently had the shadow minister for trade and tourism, Kevin Hogan, also in the area. We got to meet with great organisations like CherryHill Orchards, the Eastern Golf Club, Gardiners Run Golf Course and the RACV, looking at ways that we can bring those golf clubs together to drive tourism in the Yarra Valley.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that it's a beautiful place to visit in summer, but winter also has amazing opportunities. The minister at the time, the member for Wannon, came out and saw the amazing Yarra Valley. Hopefully he'll be back out in winter. He can visit the YAVA Gallery &amp; Arts Hub and look at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Now and Then</span> exhibition. Healesville Sanctuary has got its wine and wildlife event in July, so I'm sure we'll see the former minister there. TarraWarra Museum of Art is currently hosting the TarraWarra Biennial, featuring commissioned works from 15 artists. There are the regular high teas at Coombe Yarra Valley, the home of Dame Nellie Melba. There's a lot to see; there's a lot to do. Come out and visit the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges for a great day in Victoria.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  On Saturday I had the privilege of attending the annual Symphony by the Sea at the Brighton Concert Hall along with a sold-out crowd. This concert by students from Brighton Secondary College has been running for five years and is now in partnership with the Rotary Club of Somerton Park. It raises money for the Rotary Oceania Medical Aid for Children, which brings children and families to Australia for life-changing operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were entertained by a range of Boothby's finest musical maestros: Brighton Sinfonia, Stimson Wind Quintet, Brighton Chamber Orchestra, Combine String Orchestra and the Brighton Secondary School Orchestra. We also heard from the Rotary Club of Somerton Park solo competition winners: Amy Tretheway, who sang 'Breathe' by Miranda; Elinor Hughes, who played 'Concert Etude Op 49' by Goedicke on trumpet; Ethan Hall, who sang 'Feeling Good', which was popularised by Michael Buble; and Teya Capilitan, who gave a stunning version of 'Nightclub 1960' by Piazzolla on violin. They were all presented with their awards afterwards. It was a cool, wintry day in Boothby, and this was a fantastic way to spend the afternoon. Many congratulations to all the performers, particularly the competitors, and also to the rotary club and the school for their fundraising efforts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I speak today to lay down a petition from the residents of Apollo Bay. They want the powerlines to Apollo Bay undergrounded. What has happened when there are weather events, whether they're natural disasters or bushfires, is that they tend to have the power go out. They would like, for the safety of the town and also for the safety of the power supply, the powerlines to be undergrounded to Apollo Bay. I'd like to thank Sally Cannon. She has been the organiser of this petition. She has also called for powerlines in regional and rural Victoria, especially in bushfire-prone areas where there are going to be changes or upgrades, to also be put underground. It means then that you don't run the risk, when there are high-wind days and high-temperature days, that you're going to get bushfires. It's also environmentally a lot friendlier. More and more in regional and rural Victoria in particular are we seeing requests to see powerlines undergrounded come in. There are 420 paper signatures. There are 172 electronic signatures. I seek leave to table this petition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  Just yesterday, I was standing in a pharmacy waiting for a script to be filled, and I was struck by a sign announcing a $5 fee for blood pressure checks, a service that has previously been free. I can imagine that this was not an easy decision for the owners of the pharmacy to make, but I understand that these are the choices many pharmacies are facing in light of the government's announcement to implement 60-day dispensing for community pharmacies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No part of our health ecosystem is more important than the other. It takes a community of dedicated health professionals to diagnose, treat and manage an individual's health, or sometimes many health conditions, and our community pharmacists, particularly in regions like northern Tasmania, play a key role in health management. From Elyse in Scottsdale, Jason in Youngtown, Rhys in Summerhill, Dianne in Ravenswood, Borys in Bridport to lvo and Helen in Riverside, northern Tasmanians are fortunate to have caring pharmacists who are dedicated to the health and wellbeing of their patients. But we can't expect pharmacists to do their job, to keep their doors open to the community and to continue to employ locals in their businesses on goodwill and dedication to the job alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the hurt and frustration felt by our community pharmacists, who felt demonised by some of the comments made when the dispensing changes were first announced. Playing our healthcare sectors off against each other is a no-win situation, as is attacking pharmacy owners for their genuine concerns about how the proposed changes would impact them financially. Everybody loses if a community pharmacist can no longer afford to be in business. In order for pharmacists to do their job to the best of their ability, any government should seek to find ways to better equip pharmacists to do their job while also delivering better outcomes for patients. From what I have seen of the government's announcement so far, the 60-day dispensing change doesn't achieve either of these goals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear that I strongly support affordable access to medicines, particularly as an elected representative from Tasmania, a state that is, unfortunately, overrepresented in chronic disease. Additionally, living in an electorate with significant issues of accessibility to health care in some areas and challenges in affording necessary health care, I do understand the need to provide cheaper medicines and have advocated for such, particularly as the cost of living continues to impact many in my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do have some concerns about whether Labor's proposed changes will actually deliver cheaper medicines in the long term, and there are serious questions over what impact the changes will have on pharmacists and patients in both the short and long terms, particularly at a time when we are facing a national medicine shortage and as it has become very clear that there was very little meaningful consultation undertaken with community pharmacists about the proposed change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know that a letter from the Office of Impact Analysis has revealed that the impact of the Government's change to 60-day dispensing was not properly assessed to the standard of 'good practice'. Furthermore, the government failed to meet the criteria for good practice due to a lack of public consultation, particularly on the potential impacts for small businesses and pharmacies in rural and remote areas. It was also found to be lacking a detailed evaluation plan outlining how Labor is going to monitor the impact of the policy on community pharmacies once it is implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I'm dumbfounded by the lack of consultation, the findings are of no surprise to me after engaging with numerous community pharmacists in my community who don't feel as though their concerns have been listened to. I'd like to read an email extract from one passionate local pharmacist in my electorate about the value of community pharmacists and the damage this proposed change would bring: 'Pharmacists didn't close during COVID. We triage patients for free. We bandage up people for free. We deliver medications for free. We hug the bereaved. We give social advice to the marginalised. We pack medication packs for under cost. We deliver subsidised diabetes products for $1. The list goes on. This will all change under this announcement. People will hoard medication. Drugs will run out of stock, worse than the present out of stock. At the end of the day there'll be young pharmacists going broke, and the profession will struggle to attract new talent, who will be too scared to take on the risk of ownership if government makes changes contrary to the agreements in place. I love my job. I love my profession. I love the customers in the community I serve,' he said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want to see cheaper medicines, but the government must clearly demonstrate that our community pharmacists will not be adversely impacted by the proposal. Otherwise, we will all lose.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  Community pharmacies are a very important part of our towns and villages in Gilmore. They are there when you need them, and we have seen that first-hand through many natural disasters: the Black Summer bushfires, multiple floods and storms, and of course COVID-19. Community pharmacies, pharmacists and pharmacy workers really play—and, importantly, will continue to play—an extremely important role in our communities. They are where people go to get their medication and some advice, where people pop in to buy some essentials, to have their vaccination and more. There is great opportunity for an increase in scope for pharmacists so that pharmacists can utilise their skills even more. In a changing world, just like many businesses in my local area, this is what many businesses have had to do to survive—and that was without a government subsidy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018 the clinical experts at the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommended moving to 60-day dispensing. Instead, it was not implemented, costing Australians billions in lost savings and resulting in people paying much more for their medicines than they should have. But multiple-month dispensing is nothing new. It happens in many countries around the world, like New Zealand, the UK, France and Canada, and has worked for years. This will halve the cost of medicines for millions of Australians, and in Gilmore around 50,000 people will benefit from cheaper medicines. If this system was introduced in 2018 it would have saved patients billions of dollars. Think about that. That is taxpayers' money—taxpayers' money that has gone to keeping medicine prices higher unnecessarily.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Gilmore, incomes are not high. People are facing tough times, and people need sensible cost-of-living relief. This government is making the decision to make medicines cheaper for six million Australians. In my electorate, where there has long been a GP crisis due to the previous government's cuts to Medicare, our cheaper medicines policy will, importantly, help free up GP appointments for those who need them most and help ease pressure on our local hospitals' emergency departments as well as free up time for more GP support for nursing home residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have looked at this policy from every angle. I've listened to local views of pharmacists, GPs and patients. And I'm completely satisfied that there is no logical reason that we should not move to 60-day dispensing. But don't take my word for it. I recently received a letter signed by peak medical and consumer health organisations supporting our cheaper medicines policy, including the Consumers Health Forum, the Rural Doctors Association, the AMA, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Breast Cancer Network Australia, the Heart Foundation, Asthma Australia, Diabetes Australia, and the Lung Foundation, as well as groups like the Council of the Ageing and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, and many others. These represent patients in Gilmore with chronic conditions that will benefit from cheaper medicines. This is what Dr Dominic Frawley, a Nowra GP, had to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Patients will be able to get the same quality of care while reducing unnecessary visits to the doctor and pharmacist. This will take some pressure off appointments in general practice—making it easier for my patients to see me when the need arises. The new government is offering some genuine support to GPs and their patients, after many years of cost-cutting. That's better for me and my patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Isn't better health care for people what it's about?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been deeply disappointed that some local pharmacists, and pharmacists around Australia, have been deliberately misleading and harassing consumers with a vicious scare campaign. I have never, ever seen such atrocious, despicable behaviour—in particular, scaring and lying to vulnerable patients. Medicine shortages will not be worsened due to this initiative, nor will it directly lead to medicines going into chronic shortage. The PBAC has said the 325 medicines for chronic conditions are safe for 60-day dispensing. I understand that local pharmacist owners are concerned about their profits, but this is good health policy, and the fact that the government is putting every dollar of the $1.2 billion saved back into community pharmacy is a good thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to local pharmacists today is, in the best interests of local pharmacies and pharmacy workers, encourage the Pharmacy Guild to return to the negotiating table so that the pharmacy sector is involved in constructive discussions about the reinvestment of funding back into community pharmacy. That would be in everyone's best interests. I look forward to cheaper medicines starting on 1 September and providing much-needed cost-of-living relief for people in Gilmore.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I think the previous speaker, the member for Gilmore, laid out much of why this has become such a contentious issue. We hear the concerns raised by local pharmacists described as a 'vicious scare campaign'. There are two sides of that: dismissing these concerns out of hand as a vicious scare campaign, and hectoring the guild to come back into the consultation process. You can't do both of those two things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear: I have no doubt that the government has the intention of reducing costs of living by taking these steps. I'm not going to pretend they're out there trying to cause harm to family businesses. I think their intentions are to do good. The issue is that, with politicians, intentions aren't really what matter; it's consequences. One of the ways we tried to assuage the issues that came through was through that consultation process. What came up time and time again when I spoke to my local pharmacies, trying to understand what their issues were with this policy, was that there had been no consultation getting all the way through.</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  I hear, 'That's rubbish.' Once again we're getting dismissal from a government that, on one hand, wants to dismiss these concerns but, on the other hand, says, 'Come back to the table with us.' We had no consultation, and what that produced was a very poor policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think it's right to catastrophise these things. I have raised consistently that one of the issues I hear from my small regional and rural pharmacies—these are people who are the only medical professionals after hours. If you are hurt or need attention, people have been going to the pharmacies for exactly that in places like Goombungee, Oakey and Pittsworth for years. They are established parts of the community. That's the role they play within our health service. I'm not saying it's the right role—I think there's a lot of work to be done there—but that is the role that they play. They have raised genuine concerns around what a change to their cash flow would look like and how it would impact their business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this issue has bubbled into life and we've had all the conversations we've had—some quite angry—the consultation process has been for the government to talk to Chemist Warehouse. Now, I have nothing against Chemist Warehouse—good on them; they're a big player—but they're a big fish in this pool. They represent between eight and 10 per cent of the pharmacies in Australia. There is no way the impact on one of their businesses will be in any way similar to that on the Oakey Pharmacy. When I speak to Nathan Jervis, an example of many small pharmacies, a family-owned company, the impact is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is a pharmacy that operates in that hub-and-spoke model. They are a small town. They play a significant role, but they are already having to look at what the consequences of this will be. It looks like questions on staffing. It looks like questions on opening hours. And we look at the services that they may have to cut back on. At the moment they provide free delivery throughout their community. At the moment they provide cheap Webster-paks. They've got a great relationship with the aged-care facility out at Oakey. They also provide free delivery, particularly to the Indigenous community in our area. They support sports clubs and community events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not talking about a business. I'm not concerned about a particular business. This isn't about someone who has a financial or economic issue only. I'm talking about a family-run business that is a crucial part of the community. If you take away that business, it's not the business that fails; it's the family that fails and it's that little bit of community that falls down further. And these small regional towns have witnessed this constant drain over generations, away and out of these towns, and they have seen how hard it can be to get projects off the, generate employment and keep these places going ground in these towns. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of reducing those services in that town will be felt. It's not going to be a landslide or calamitous. It's going to be town by town getting a little bit worse and a little bit worse. I think that's the issue at play here. Whatever their intentions are—I say again that I don't think the government is trying to hurt these small businesses—they've not listened. They've not gone out and spoken to them. The impacts on these small businesses will be considerably different to the impacts on giant national companies like Chemist Warehouse. To pretend otherwise is absolutely ridiculous. To demonise the guild—if you don't want to talk to the guild, talk to the Pharmaceutical Society. If there's an opportunity to talk, these people will absolutely do it. I think you'll get a very different answer from what we've been getting.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  I wish to thank the local pharmacies in my electorate and in urban Ipswich as well as the country towns for the work they do, the employment they provide and the contribution they make with local organisations, including sport organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to speak on this motion because it gives me an opportunity to call out some of the exaggerated claims and scaremongering around the Albanese Labor government's plan to allow Australians to buy two month's worth of medicine for the price of a single prescription. This policy is supported by so many health organisations: Consumers Health Forum, the Heart Foundation, the Lung Foundation, the Breast Cancer Network, the Rural Doctors Association, the AMA and so many others. The reality is our cheaper medicines policy will help around six million people: patients with chronic health conditions who require regular drug treatment for the rest of their lives, halving their medicine costs and saving $1.6 billion over four years, with fewer visits to the GP and the pharmacist. It builds on the changes that we've made in terms of the costs of prescription medicines from the beginning of this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately the Pharmacy Guild, which represents the interests of too many pharmacies and now the opposition, are trying to mislead Australians with a dishonest scare campaign. The suggestion in the motion that the government has not consulted with, or listened to, the concerns of community pharmacists is simply not true. The Pharmacy Guild were briefed early, and in detail, by the government on the increased dispensing policy which is the basis of a recommendation of the independent expert Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the PBAC. That body is made up of clinical experts, including from the pharmacies sector. Moreover, the changes were first recommended back in 2018. So for the Pharmacy Guild to now claim that the prospects of the proposal being implemented were not known to them is simply disingenuous. They weren't letting on to their members about this prospect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBAC has now reconsidered the issue and recommended hundreds more—in fact up to 300 more of the most common medicines used by Australians. The majority of these are currently in good supply or have a readily available alternative. It's disappointing that the Pharmacy Guild has chosen to break their non-disclosure agreement with the government prior to the announcement of their reasons and deal themselves out of the policy implementation discussions. The invitation remains for them to be engaged in a constructive process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met with many local pharmacists in my electorate. I had a Zoom meeting with up to 31 people. I had meetings in my electorate office in Ipswich and also down here in Canberra. I'll continue to engage with them, as will the Minister for Health and Aged Care and other government members because we know how important local community pharmacies and the role they play in our local communities are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the motion calls for the government to guarantee this change will not harm the viability of community pharmacies. Don't get me wrong. We acknowledge there will be some impact on individual pharmacies, including in regional and rural areas. But that's why the government is reinvesting money back into the community pharmacy sector. The government recognises that rural and regional pharmacies face particular challenges; that's why we've doubled the rural pharmacy maintenance allowance ahead of the introduction of the policy. This provides a significant boost to small and regional pharmacies, with some pharmacies set to receive more than $90,000 under the subsidy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting the Australian pharmacy sector receives a lot of government support already. On the whole it is highly profitable, well regulated and highly protected. For example, the total industry revenue was estimated to be nearly $26 billion this year, with an industrywide profit margin of well over eight per cent. The benchmark the Pharmacy Guild has been using is a highly selective use by the Pharmacy Guild. It's an inaccurate description of the profitability of the sector, relying on that figure that I refer to based on the turnover of pharmacies earning more than $3.5 million a year. That's not the preferred benchmark of the ATO, by the way, which is the cost of sales, not the expenses divided by annual turnover, which the Pharmacy Guild tends to use. If you look at that, it goes from the actual eight per cent to nearly 38 per cent profitability, which is commensurate with what a legal practice, an accounting practice or some other professional practice might earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument also that somehow this will result in drugs not being available or not being dispensed is simply nonsense, quite frankly. The PBAC considered this whole issue on 5 May, and the chair of the PBAC, Andrew Wilson, confirmed that 60-day dispensing will not cause medicine shortages, and it's simply rubbish to say otherwise. RMIT has said that, Macquarie University has said, and a whole range of other people have said that as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I have actually seen figures—private figures given to me—from a pharmacist who runs three or four pharmacies in my area and others. I have seen what these changes will do to their bottom line. I have seen that he is arguing to me that it will cost jobs in his businesses. I have seen what others have argued to me, from Phillip Island to San Remo and down to Grantville—all the way through my regional areas. They are saying to me that these changes will force them to close the very small pharmacies that they've got in local communities, especially in country and regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really important to me, because sometimes the only health care provided in districts and electorates like mine is through the local pharmacist. That's the only way people are able to get some medical information, benefit or whatever their need may be before they have to go on quite a trip to get to a hospital or a GP. Because of that interaction every month, the pharmacist gets to see the person involved. It's very similar to aged care. If gastroenteritis goes through an aged-care community and the doctor only comes once a week, if Mrs Jones isn't diagnosed as having gastro, she can be so dehydrated by the time the doctor does come that it may be too late for her in that situation. You can't expect the tea lady taking the morning tea around to particular clients in the aged-care setting to diagnose why somebody may not be eating or taking their cup of tea. It's not up to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When pharmacists are seeing clients once a month rather than every two months, they actually get a chance to assess how the medicines are going, whether they need to attend a doctor for more attention or whether they have deteriorated in the last month. If we leave that for two months, that's six times a year. This system has worked so very well, especially for country communities, that we encourage pharmacists to go out and create these smaller unit pharmacies in more remote locations so that we can have our small communities getting the same sort of service you'd get in a larger community with one, two or three pharmacies. These changes have been put to me by genuine pharmacists coming to me with their issues. I've spoken to them, and they have said to me, 'This will be the result of these government changes.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not a protector of minority groups of doctors or pharmacists or any group. I'm not. But I like to listen to their genuine concerns, and I like to know that information I'm being given is factual. So when someone gives me the actual books of their chemist shop, and says: 'Here they are. You're a former retailer; you work it out. Here are all the lines, and this is what's going to happen to those lines, and, therefore, some of the things we're doing for free and some of the things we're doing on the cheap, we won't be able to do anymore because we have to keep viability within the business somehow.' And they say: 'I know that I am going to lose a number of valued staff members that I've had for a long time. They're going to lose their jobs because there won't be the work for them to do within the pharmacy.' Even the Prime Minister's own pharmacist said, 'These changes will break me.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pharmacies that I deal with are family businesses. They're small businesses in country towns. They are the pharmacists and they are highly regarded within their community. They're highly regarded by me. I'd like to see the government really go and consult with the pharmacists and the pharmacies guild, and see if they can come up with some reasonable changes to this legislation they're putting forward. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  Firstly, I'd like to recognise Dan Lalor, Canberra Hospital's chief pharmacist, for his recognition in the King's Birthday Honours last week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a previous life, I represented both hospital and community pharmacists, and it was a real privilege. Across the country our community pharmacists do an enormous amount of work in our local communities. They were at the frontline during the COVID pandemic, during the Canberra bushfires, and every day they work with their patients to ensure they're getting their medicines and that they're being cared for. People rightly perceive pharmacists as highly reliable advisers on many personal health matters; trustworthy, independent sources of healthcare products; and steadfast partners of the medical profession and other allied health professions. This has been clearly shown in national and international literature on consumers' views and experiences of consumer pharmacy practice. It accords with my own experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My local pharmacists are critical for health care delivery in Bean, and I want to thank them, on the record, for all they do. I want to thank them for supporting my constituents with their vaccinations, their blister packs and their basic medical needs, right through to their outreach in our aged and disability care communities. I also want to thank my local pharmacists for spending their valuable time meeting and briefing me on our government's changes on dispensing and the government's reinvestment into community pharmacy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy intent of 60-day dispensing is sound. We all want people visiting the doctor less often, saving time and money on dispensing and having more funds reinvested into our community pharmacy network. As many people would know, the government is driving this policy intent by delivering cheaper medicines through 60-day dispensing for more than six million Australians. This will halve the cost of medicines for millions of Australians, including pensioners, many of whom who have been living with chronic conditions for years. It's worth noting that in January of this year, Labor cut the price of more than 2,000 brands of medicine, delivering $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. Introducing 60-day prescribing for stable, ongoing conditions isn't a new idea. It was a recommendation of the clinical experts at the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee back in 2018. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to supporting better access to health care for all Australians, including through critical services provided by pharmacists. Every single dollar that will be saved by the government from lower dispensing fees paid to pharmacies will be reinvested back into community pharmacy practice, funding the services that will directly benefit patients. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 January, Australians eligible for the National Immunisation Program will be able to get their vaccine from their pharmacy for free. The government will pay the pharmacy per vaccine administered. NIP is an uncapped program, and, in fact, demand is likely to increase over time as more vaccines are added to the NIP and the Australian population grows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBS Opioid Dependence Treatment Program will broaden access to treatments in community pharmacies from 1 July 2023. These programs alone will mean nearly $500 million will be invested by the Albanese government into community pharmacies over five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also investing $350 million to community pharmacy outreach into aged-care facilities to ensure older Australians are managing their medications. In addition to this, more than $650 million in funding for community pharmacy programs will ensure patients can access critical medication management and Dose Administration Aids programs through community pharmacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, I've been made aware, through my meetings and correspondence with my community pharmacies, of some of the many implementation challenges and the cost impacts of the changes to 60-day dispensing. I'm concerned that it's critical that our local pharmacists who want to keep doing their valuable work need that support in terms of doing that service as these changes transition through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the government continues to work with all parts of the pharmacy sector on the implementation of this policy. This includes an invitation to the Pharmacy Guild to engage in constructive discussions with the government on the implementation policy and the significant reinvestment of funding in the pharmacy sector. These ongoing discussions are important. I'd urge all parties to continue to work together. I'll continue to engage with my local pharmacy community, but I support these proposed changes to 60-day dispensing.</span>

This issue has led to a huge uplift of correspondence into my electorate office and communication with pharmacies right across my electorate. There are a few issues with the way this was done. There was a lack of consultation included in the first place, and that has led to the situation we are now in. Even the Office of Impact Analysis has stressed that the report was lacking a reasonable level of consultation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard during question time in the House that this particular policy was formulated some years ago and it's just been sitting there. There's a reason it's just been sitting there, and that is because it's just not good for regional pharmacies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been contacted by some of my larger pharmacists—for instance, out at Broken Hill—and some of my smaller ones. I'll give you a good example: the pharmacy at Walgett. Walgett has a 45 per cent Indigenous population, and that's part of the irony of this debate we're having in this House at the moment. On one hand, we're hearing wonderful speeches about the government and other people's great care for our Indigenous brothers and sisters, but, on the other hand, they're implementing policies that are impacting on those very communities and the people that provide those services. Walgett is a long way from the next town. A lot of the Indigenous population of Walgett do rely on the Walgett Pharmacy for the services they provide—blister packs to aged care, to people who are having services delivered at home—and the potential closure of a business such as that would be devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other pharmacy I've spoken about is Gilgandra Pharmacy. Emma Robinson, the pharmacist there, has done an incredible job in building that business so that they are providing a broad range of services. Indeed, I had my flu shot there last year—my flu shot or one of the COVID ones, I can't quite remember—but they are doing great work in that section. Emma is supporting some trainees so that we've got new pharmacists coming through. Emma employs several other pharmacists. She was telling me that it's going to be really difficult for her to maintain that level of service in the town of Gilgandra. We heard from the other side that the AMA are supportive of these changes. It's fine for the AMA. The taxpayers are paying for the changes to bulk-billing and other things like that, and fair enough. With these changes, it's expected the pharmacists will pay. There's been some detail in here about the work that the pharmacists are doing with addiction programs and some of the services they provide to community around methadone and other things. I'm being told by my local pharmacist that that is going to really impact on what they do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard from members on the other side how profitable pharmacy is. But in some of my communities they're the primary provider of medical services. Even if they're not the only one, quite often they're the most constant provider, because in an era where we have fly-in fly-out locum doctors, and where every time a patient might go to a doctor at the clinic down the road there's a different face, the pharmacist generally is the constant. I've had pharmacists say to me that patients will come in with a script, and, while they might not have confidence in or a complete understanding of what the GP has told them, they go to the local pharmacist to get advice about their medication and the things they take.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program is ill-conceived in its time, and I will agree with the member for Bean that there is still time for consultation to actually salvage something from this rushed announcement and make sure that those pharmacies can continue to provide the services right across Australia and particularly in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so important that MPs engage and debate this. ChatGPT has fuelled public awareness of artificial intelligence, but large language models are just the canary in the coalmine. AI technologies are set to transform human society, how we experience our lives and how we understand reality. Like a new pair of glasses or hearing aids that are difficult to remove, AI will shape our perception of life as it influences what we see, hear, think and experience online and offline. Our everyday life will be augmented by having a superbright intern always by our side. Service delivery by governments and businesses will be transformed, unleashing creative destruction in some sectors of the economy but hopefully driving Australia's next big productivity boost.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our understanding of the universe and the world has been developed for millennia through reason, the scientific method and faith. Yet over the next generation, living with non-human pseudo-intelligence will challenge established notions of what it is to be human. Advanced AI systems trained on massive datasets are already spotting new links and patterns. Many appear true but are beyond human comprehension. Others are downright wrong, as a result of faulty data or algorithms. AI is maths. It's not magic. It's not a modern-day Delphic oracle to be worshipped or blindly obeyed. Citizens and policymakers must urgently get a grip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While AI has the potential to generate enormous wealth, exponentially more powerful AI technologies unaligned with human ethics and goals bring unacceptable risks. Put simply, superpowerful AI is a sociopath, a shoggoth disguised with a smiley mask by engineers trying to align it to prevent misuse. But how might authoritarian governments, bad actors or rogue citizens misuse AI to trash human rights, attack democratic societies, scale up scams and organised crime, and harness dangerous knowledge and capabilities otherwise unavailable? It's more serious than the opposition's big fear, of course—that ChatGPT may support the Voice to Parliament! But, just as humanity was right to worry about the risky gain-of-function virology research, we're right to worry about uncontrolled generative AI. Imagine unleashing this pseudo-intelligence with self-executing power connected to the internet without intermediating human judgement. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Safer AI technologies, well aligned to human values and needs, are only possible with public intervention. Decisions that shape the future of our society cannot be left to the private interests of technologists and multinationals alone. Governments must act in the public and the national interest to establish guard rails and determine how and where to apply both the accelerator and the brake, harnessing the benefits of AI while mitigating and managing the risks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AI use must support our Australian, established values of social justice, equality, democratic participation and nation-building. Our new government is now acting to address Australia's AI capability and governance gap. Australia has the chance now to cherry-pick from world-leading and diverse approaches globally and to craft our own world-leading AI regulatory response, one which unashamedly voices, champions and embeds our values and the famed Australian commitment to a fair go. None of this is easy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying this next bit, I point out that it's not government policy. I propose the establishment of a time-limited AI commission, just for five or six years, located right at the centre of government and bringing together industry, public servants, academia and civil society. Its functions could include fostering public awareness and education; rapidly building capability across the public sector; formulating options to guide policy responses, including sovereign capability; reviewing proposals; and engaging with the leading international thinking and debate around AI. What you might call, in a non-catchy phrase, a light-touch, cross-disciplinary institutionalisation would see ethicists, lawyers, philosophers, psychologists, economists, doctors, sociologists, educators and public administrators as equal partners with the scientists and the technologists. We can't support pushback from scientists and the multinationals saying this is too complex. Parliamentarians have to be engaged with this debate. None of it's easy. A parallel could be drawn with the Climate Change Authority, the Australian Cybersecurity Centre or the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe we also need to regulate access to the most powerful tech. We don't allow people to pick their kids up in battle tanks or businesses to run around with rocket launchers, and I'm pleased the government is acting now.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion brought by the honourable member for Bruce, and I thank him for bringing this important motion about artificial intelligence. I agree with most of the comments made by the honourable member in his speech, particularly that parliamentarians must do more around artificial intelligence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Artificial intelligence is one of the most transformational technologies of the 21st century. It is, in my view, equivalent with the Industrial Revolution. It is the most significant technology development since the creation of the internet itself. While most of the public commentary on artificial intelligence focuses on its potential risk, I prefer that we also recognise the enormous opportunities and benefits that will flow from this technology. We should not be afraid of this technology. We need to embrace it and we need to work out how we can make it work in our world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're at an exciting tipping point in the way the world operates, and the technology advancement we are seeing around AI will be a major and exciting change in the world's economic development. It is very important, therefore, that Australia is on the front foot with this. I note that the honourable member for Bruce said that it's important that governments get on the front foot with AI. I support that view, and that's why I think it's a shame that it hasn't been proposed by the Albanese Labor government that there be a minister for the digital economy, for example, because that would really assist in driving the nation forward on the very important front of AI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a shame, for example, that this government in its last budget did not prioritise investment in AI. There was no new funding in the budget for AI. It said there was roughly $20 million per year for five years, paid for by redirecting funding from within the Industry portfolio. I note that some parts of industry weren't particularly impressed with the budget. For example, the CEO of Sapia.ai, Barb Hyman, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is a massive missed opportunity from the Federal Government to surge ahead in what is fast becoming the race to not only pioneer but leverage new AI technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… this innovation is time-sensitive. By the time it's a focus globally, it will be too late.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant economic opportunities for Australia. These include the emergence of new businesses and more jobs, whether they are pure digital economy businesses or businesses looking to be supported by AI. The changing nature of jobs will expand education offerings from universities to VET and into the school education system. It's the much-needed improvement to productivity that our country needs, enabling businesses to achieve more and also retaining and enhancing our international competitiveness as other high-tech countries accelerate their uptake of AI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are challenges that can be addressed, and it is important that these challenges are managed by government rather than used by government to stifle opportunity. For example, regulation will be required for the use of data in terms of attribution, transparency and misinformation. National security matters will need to be addressed, as the power of AI will have profound reach into our security. Legal frameworks will need to be established. These are vitally important to maintaining Australia's high global standing of having stable governance structures while protecting the use by citizens and operations of businesses for all that AI provides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be ethical considerations that will need navigation. Business models will need regulation. Data security and individual privacy will need to be addressed, and that's one of the issues that must remain paramount. Job displacement will need supporting education and training policies. Finally, the way artificial intelligence engages with and collaborates with humans, or the human interaction requirements, will need to be carefully managed. Other countries are developing their approach to AI whilst our current government appears to have missed another opportunity, with a lack of investment in the budget. Let's hope that the next budget does fix that mistake from the last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, to conclude, the Australian government now needs to move quickly, otherwise we are at risk of missing out on business investment, economic growth, new jobs, wealth generation and an improvement in lifestyle, with a government that so far appears to be lacking in focus and investment in this area. I do commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I rise before the House to support the motion put forward by my colleague the member for Bruce and to speak on a matter that promises to redefine our future, artificial intelligence. AI, as we call it, is a force of change. It's a technology that is sweeping across the globe, and Australia is not isolated from this. In the face of AI, there is of course some uncertainty. AI includes a range of technologies and applications, each with their own possibilities and challenges. But one thing is crystal clear: AI is transforming our society, our experience of life and how we perceive reality. I also know that there's a bit of apprehension out there about what it could mean for jobs, our society and our way of life. But let me tell you: just as we've embraced the wealth of our land through mining, it's time for us to embrace the wealth of our minds through AI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Harnessing the benefits of AI could unlock huge potential for our nation. Imagine a productivity surge across industries and a transformation of our economy with new job opportunities created through AI, and picture enhanced health, wealth and equality outcomes for all Australians through improved government services delivery. Think about the possibilities of better environmental sustainability decisions driven by AI and the acceleration of scientific discoveries. Australia is not just a country rich in minerals; we're also a country rich in technical talent, innovation and technological capabilities. We're the country that invented wi-fi. I want to see us enhance our technology potential in much the same way that we've harnessed the power of our resources sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: AI doesn't have to be about replacing jobs. It could be about enhancing them. It could be about freeing up our dedicated Australian workers so that they can focus on what really matters to them. It's about equipping our workforce with the tools they need to perform their jobs more effectively and efficiently. It's about creating new opportunities, new industries and new jobs that we can't even imagine just yet. That's why we as a government need to step up. We need to invest in our people, invest in our businesses—invest in our future. We need to ensure our education system is equipping our young people with the skills they need to thrive in this new area. We need to support our businesses, large and small, in adopting and integrating AI technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, with every revolution comes a set of risks. We must acknowledge and mitigate these as we embrace the AI wave. From job security risks to risks of amplified biases and discrimination, from disinformation and misinformation threats and potential social and democratic harm to the threat of social disruption and risks to national security, we have our work cut out for us. As the motion says, the transformational power of AI is on par with the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. To manage the potential risks, urgent policy development and a steadfast regulatory approach are called for. The responsibility of AI governance and regulation cannot be left to industry or technical experts alone. We, as members of this parliament, bear the responsibility to act thoughtfully and swiftly in response to these changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments around the world are taking diverse approaches to AI regulation. The European Union, the United States, China and the United Kingdom are all stepping up to the challenge, and we must do the same. We must foster a national debate about AI, seize the colossal opportunities that it will continue to generate, and mitigate the risks posed by unchecked AI. We must carve out an Australian approach to AI governance and regulation—an approach that champions democratic participation, nation-building, social justice, equality, consumer protection and international cooperation. Let's lead Australia into this brave new world with foresight, responsibility and coverage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, we're a country of innovators and builders. We have always been at the forefront of change. There's no reason for us to stop now. So let's embrace AI, let's harness its potential and let's make sure Australia continues to lead. AI isn't some distant, abstract concept. It's here and it's now. It's helping doctors diagnose faster and more accurately, it's assisting farmers to manage their crops more efficiently, and, Madam Deputy Speaker, it's even helping to write speeches for parliamentarians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I thank the member for Bruce for moving this important motion. I've just asked ChatGPT to give me a five-minute speech, and it looks like it's covered most of what I've got to say today, but I'm still going to work off what I put together originally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to technological capability we have become aware of in the last year are nothing short of miraculous. The technological promise of AI is so great that we will doubtless see huge, unexpected changes from its adoption in the years to come. I genuinely believe that AI could be as transformative in this century as the transistor was in the last. The opportunities will be enormous and dispersed across every part of our economy. AI will help farmers maximise crop yields and minimise pesticide use. It will help businesses find their customers and ensure their products are the right fit. Just last week, I met with a radiologist who had started adopting AI tools to help improve the accuracy of their diagnoses. Lives will be saved because of these tools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are incredible opportunities for AI to help Australians start their own businesses, supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. That's not least because Australia has very strong data, which is an incredibly important underpinning of AI. It will enable, I think, further growth in the tech sector here in Australia, which already does incredible work and could do so much more to help Australians reach their potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course this comes with risk. The first that comes to mind is the increasing use of deepfakes, which are getting to the point where they're indistinguishable from genuine content. Seeing is no longer worth believing. I worry about the effect it will have on our society, particularly as malicious actors use deepfakes as a tool of disinformation. We know misinformation and disinformation already pose serious risks to our democracy. AI may supercharge those risks.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A second risk, and one about which many are concerned, is job displacement. AI has mainly been experimental for many people in their jobs rather than the replacement of people by the technology, and there's suddenly the opportunity for AI to really augment individual productivity. But there will be changes to the job market because of AI, and that will affect people in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other risks. If you ask one of the commonly available AI systems, such as ChatGPT, about the risks, they flow quickly across your screen: bias and discrimination from systems trained on datasets that contain inbuilt discriminations will amplify and perpetuate those biases, and we've already seen those in how they affect not only women but also minority communities such as LGBTIQ; security and privacy risks, as AI enables surveillance and data collection to increase exponentially; ethical and moral concerns as life-and-death decisions are delegated to AI were lack of transparency and even explainability leaves AI making life-changing decisions that very few of us can comprehend and for which no-one is clearly accountable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These risks are real, and our understanding of these risks is inadequate. So there is a strong argument for regulatory intervention with AI, and I support the principle of ensuring that Australians are protected from the downsides as much as reasonable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a danger if we overregulate, if we try and protect ourselves from every possible negative effect of change and end up missing out on the real benefits of reform. This is what we've seen in so many areas of government action. It's why the burden of regulation falls so heavily on business and why we've experienced lacklustre economic productivity and wage growth for the last 15 years. Let's not make the same mistake with AI. Let's get on the front foot and ensure we have a regulatory framework that is fit for purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I very much agree with the member for Bruce on the recommendation that our first responsibility is to get educated, get educated across the parliament and get educated across this country. Let's work with AI users, let's work with businesses, workers, researchers and experts. Let's develop our understanding and develop the regulatory framework at the same time to make sure that it is fit for purpose. By embracing AI with a balanced and proactive approach, we can ensure that businesses realise their potential, drive economic growth and become more competitive in the global market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government must foster an environment that encourages innovation, prioritises ethical considerations and invests in essential skills and infrastructure. We need to do everything possible to ensure Australians fully benefit from this incredible technology and what it has to offer but also protect our country, our values and the most vulnerable.</span>

I did not use AI to write this speech, but I did use AI to turn each section of this speech into the style of a different Labor prime minister, so, for those playing at home, let's see if you can identify which PM inspired which section.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're starting with the first section: We must stand firmly committed to the safe and inclusive adoption of transformative technologies such as AI. We need to embrace the immense potential that AI holds while ensuring that its development and deployment align with the interests and value of our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AI encompasses a wide spectrum of technologies that permeate every sector of our economy. Studies may well say that AI could contribute a staggering $1 trillion to $4 trillion to our economy over the next 15 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already witnessed awe-inspiring applications of AI in tackling real-world challenges. From combating the impacts of climate change to revolutionising the development of life-saving vaccines, AI has consistently demonstrated its value in resolving everyday problems. A prime example lies within my own electorate of Bennelong, where Medtronic has crafted an intelligent endoscopy module. This groundbreaking technology, empowered by AI, has been granted approval by the TGA in Australia and amplifies the prospects of early detection for colorectal cancer, an ailment that is highly treatable if treated in its nascent stages.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the next section: Nonetheless, it is essential to confront the legitimate concerns and risks that accompany the rapid development of AI. The accelerated progress of AI models has understandably raised apprehensions that these technologies may be deployed prematurely without a comprehensive understanding of their implications. Any unchecked specificity of rollout of AI jeopardises jobs, industrial relations and exacerbates biases, deepening social divisions. Disinformation and misinformation amplified by AI can erode our democracy and social fabric. We must be wary of social disruption and national security threats stemming from AI's malicious misuse in cyberattacks and the spread of deceptive information. It is incumbent on us to confront these challenges head on. We must address issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, security, potential misuse of AI and the dissemination of misinformation. By doing so, we can foster an environment that harnesses AI's immense potential while safeguarding our society's wellbeing and interest.</span>

Furthermore, we have started to take proactive measures to establish regulatory frameworks for AI in Australia as trailblazers in the field. We were among the first nations to develop national AI ethics principles, underscoring our commitment to responsible AI development. Through proactive steps, this government demonstrates our unwavering dedication to ensuring that AI development and deployment in Australia align with our values, priorities and the best interests of our citizens.

Furthermore, we have allocated a significant sum of $132 million to the eSafety Commissioner.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  I also want to start by honouring the member for Bruce. He could not have picked a more significant topic, and he has been talking about it for a number of months. The reality is that AI will dwarf in significance the vast majority of issues that we discuss in this building. This is really quite a remarkable point in history, as this technology really starts to come to practical fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, the first time I used ChatGPT—which obviously is the one getting the headlines—it reminded me of much of the first time I used Netscape, when I was at university in the mid-nineties—the first commercial web browser. That moment, for me, was like, 'Wow, the world is about to change dramatically.' And it did. I think we are at a similar inflection point with AI. I'm not generally a hype merchant. There's been a lot of technologies that have come and gone over the years that I've had little to say about or have been quite sceptical of, like cryptocurrency. But this is very different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of things we need to do as a society to respond to this. The first is the basic principle of 'first do no harm'. As others have pointed out, there is the risk of jumping too aggressively into the regulatory sphere here, and that could be very problematic, because the last thing we want to do is suppress that innovation and investment into AI technology in Australia. In Australia we've always been good at consuming technology. We've always been very early adopters of technology. Where our record is less clear is in the development of IP related to technology. We've done a lot of good things, and people often use the examples of wi-fi, ResMed, cochlear and a range of other examples. But in some aspects of technology we've been a stronger consumer than we have been a creator. It's really important that we be at the forefront of the creation of intellectual property.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important that we take a leading role in the assessment of risk, which is very real, and that we lead in that regulatory role. Everyone says that there are huge opportunities here but that they come with huge risks. That insight is in no way unique, but the question is: what are you going to do about it? It is important for the government to take action soon. We welcomed the release of those government reports a couple of weeks ago in relation to the consultation process. That was good, but we do need to see the government take action. We are a little perplexed as to why the Minister for Industry and Science seems to be leading this process on his own. Clearly there's a regulatory question concerning the internet which one would think would be in the domain of the Minister for Communications, and we would like to see a broader response to these issues from the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want to see the government take action right now on the particular issue of the use of intellectual property within generative AI models. Basically what's happening now is that a lot of IP of Australian companies is being taken for use in generative AI models, but there is no compensation being provided, as it would be in the normal course of events under intellectual property law. The government needs to act on that. That issue has been known for a while now, and they need to take action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of mitigating risks, it's a question of sovereignty. Just as every other technology has, ultimately, been controlled within the realms of our sovereignty and democracy, so too must AI. That is the framework through which you need to think about this. There's complexity in AI products that are created by open source. There are a whole range of issues about how one regulates products where the creators themselves are not entirely clear on how their products work or how they manifest themselves in the market. There's huge complexity. It's very likely that international cooperation will be required, and OpenAI has had some interesting things to say about that which the government should look at very closely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local news media and local newspapers play a vital and important role in our regional communities. Much-loved local newspapers in Mayo include the <span style="font-style:italic;">Victor </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Harbor Times</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fleurieu</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Sun</span>, which is quite a new paper. They're both on the south coast. I also have the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mount Barker </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Courier</span>, which is a very long-established paper in Mayo, the Kangaroo Island <span style="font-style:italic;">Islander</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Southern Argus</span>, which covers the eastern side of the Hills, through Strathalbyn and right down to Goolwa. I have a regional electorate, and it has really well-loved regional newspapers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These publications make a key contribution to the fourth pillar of the democratic state, helping to hold those in government to account—independent media that help deliver diversity, both geographically and in a market which is dominated by two large players. As well as covering national issues, these newspapers advocate for, and cover, stories of significant local importance which might otherwise not receive attention from mainstream media. In regional communities, they have a further positive role, contributing to community wellbeing. I see them as the social glue that holds our towns and our regions together. They respond to local victories, but also they cover local tragedies with great sensitivity. They help to preserve the local histories we so highly value. They are often family run businesses. From the beginning of the COVID pandemic to now, we saw over 200 regional newspapers close across Australia. With changes to the federal government's communications policy at the last election, papers are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain consistent revenue streams. They now rely on revenue from digital platforms, cover price and government support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But federal government inquiries into regional media in recent years have recommended that the federal government commit funding to regional media advertising. That's why I'm calling on the government to review its communications policy and regional print media funding. For example, I believe that Australians should be able to read about changes to Centrelink or indeed the referendum in their local newspaper. I've been contacted by Country Press Australia. They tell me that the independent regional newspapers have not been included in the government advertising plans for the referendum. They tell me that, if this stands, it will reinforce the interpretation that the referendum is focused on power centres in Canberra and our capital cities. Regional and remote Australia rely heavily on our local newspapers. For many of us, it's considered the Bible, and you pick it up every Monday or Thursday or whenever it's out. Deakin University confirmed recently that securing the future of quality and reliable news and information platforms in non-metropolitan areas is in the national interest and that local news matters to our democracy. But it has struggled and is requiring support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that regional print media is included when government are organising their advertising and information-sharing, particularly with respect to the Voice referendum process. Retaining regional print media is one way to engage and communicate better with regional Australians. It maximises our social harmony. It provides ongoing opportunities for country people who want to work in journalism. I urge the government to provide support for the media and news diversity in regional Australia. When you support our regional media, you're supporting regional Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  I want to thank the member for Mayo for this motion and for giving me the opportunity to acknowledge the work that our local newspapers do to keep our communities informed about matters that are local and most important to them. I am a proud supporter of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cessnock Advertiser</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Maitland Mercury</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Port Stephens Examiner</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> of the Area</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Port Stephens</span>. I am particularly grateful to be able to contribute to these newspapers' bottom lines by updating my community on federal issues and matters that affect them by advertising in the newspapers. It is very important. I also take this opportunity to note that the <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ews of the Area</span>, an independent paper in my electorate, has been playing a really important role in reporting on local issues and delivering opportunities to good local journalists. My government recognises the critical role that these local publishers play in Australian communities, particularly in regional communities like my own. Social media, let's be frank, has had an immense impact on their viability, and some may say that social media is the future. But, like me, many in my community still relish reading a good paper over a cup of tea in the morning, or sitting in the sun in the afternoon and checking in with the local paper, looking at what's being advertised by local businesses and what services are on offer, catching up potentially on some local history, doing the crossword and occasionally reading our stars. For me, it is an institution. Locally, when there was talk of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Port Stephens Examiner</span> closing, my constituency were straight on the phones to me to save the paper, as they could not imagine missing their local newspaper. I got on the blower straight away to the editor and received an update on what was going on with the paper. Then I spoke to my friend and colleague the Minister for Communications, Michelle Rowland, and she was already right across her brief. The government has recognised the rising costs for publishers and is providing $15 million through the Regional and Local Newspaper Publishers program as part of a local news and community broadcasting package; 206 regional independent First Nations and multicultural print publishers were recipients of this grant. My government is currently developing the new media assistance program. You'll hear it called News MAP, for short, around the corridors here. This will establish a principles based policy framework for longer term policy and future funding interventions for news media and new media. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a former journalist and radio talk show host, a role that I did love. In fact, among the reasons I decided to run for parliament was not only the importance of local news and platforms in letting people be heard but also the absolutely intrinsic need for communities to feel connected, updated and as though they know what's going on in their local area. That is something that print journalism does so well. Let's face it, truth-telling can be somewhat of a mystery in this modern world we face, and vocalising and posting unfounded nonsense is often a fact of social media. When we have to try to navigate that, really good journalists do a sensational job. They are well trained, they're genuine, they're respected, they do a lot of research and they ask a lot of questions. On the whole, print media journalists in our regional areas do such a good job because they know our communities. They know if the story doesn't add up. They think to ask the appropriate and meaningful questions. They handle local sensitivities very, very well and at times they're extremely entertaining because they understand the local angles on things so intimately. </span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Sharkie, and I congratulate you, as the member Mayo, for bringing this motion to the Chamber. I acknowledge that it has been more than 35 years since I started out as a cadet journalist with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gippsland Times</span> newspaper in my electorate of Gippsland. While there has been a massive disruption to media in those 35 years, there's no question that the information and the stories provided through newspapers in my electorate, like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Latrobe Valley Express</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gippsland Times</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> in Yarram, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lakes Post</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bairnsdale Advertiser</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Snowy River Mail</span>, are still critically important in this disrupted media market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional newspapers are part of the rich fabric of life outside our capital cities. They tell our stories of births, deaths, marriages, sporting achievements and natural disasters: the human interest stories and the local events. The whole rich diversity of regional and rural communities is reflected in their local newspapers. So it's terribly important that print journalism and print newspapers continue to exist in this country, particularly when they are offering such a diverse regional perspective. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be noted that they also play an incredibly important role in terms of the historic record of our regional communities. Being able to research information of past events is very useful from the print media perspective. Interestingly, when we reflect on this place, while they're a great training ground for metropolitan journalists and photographers, they have also been an incredible training ground for future members of parliament. For better or worse, there have been plenty of members of parliament who had a background in the regional media. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just nostalgia that brings me to speak on the motion before the Chamber today. Local news does matter, and the print media does matter in making sure that our stories are heard in rural and regional communities. I believe the print media deserves our support, and I think the Commonwealth has a role to play in that regard. The previous coalition government certainly offered that support in tough times. We knew that the regional media was facing very tough times, particularly during the COVID lockdown period, and we assisted as they sought to overcome key issues, such as the rising costs of energy and paper, and ensured they were able to maintain a revenue stream during that time. We established the $50 million Public Interest News Gathering program. That allowed many regional newspaper publishers to apply for funding to support their paper's sustainability. We also funded the $60 million Regional and Small Publishers Jobs and Innovation Package, which I think is another good initiative, and it was very important that we did that at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that, while the new government has maintained some level of support, it has dropped that level of support to regional print. It worries me that we've seen a reduction in funding. I'm concerned that not enough of the members opposite actually understand the important role of regional media. There are some members here that do—I don't question that—but overwhelmingly the Labor Party and the government we have today is over-represented by metropolitan members of parliament and only a handful of what I'd call rural and regional members of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically—Deputy Speaker Sharkie, you touched on it in your own comments here today—regional print newspapers need revenue. They need a revenue stream. I'm concerned by reports that federal government advertising has dropped substantially since the new government took office last year, particularly in relation to the issue of the Voice and the referendum. I've been receiving letters from independent regional newspapers across Victoria who are saying to me that they've seen a massive decline in advertising. They are saying to me that if this decline in their revenue stream continues, they won't be able to employ the public interest journalists and photographers who help them publish their newspapers and it will undermine their capacity to produce a product.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What really concerns me, though, is specifically in relation to the Voice referendum. Regional newspapers are saying in their letters to us in rural and regional Victoria that independent regional newspapers have not been included in the most recent government advertising schedule for the referendum. That worries me enormously. This is an issue where making sure the public is informed of both the 'yes' and 'no' perspectives is critically important. The newspaper owners are very concerned that they have been excluded from the advertising schedule of this important referendum. The member publications of the Country Press Australia reach more regional Australians with their trusted independent local news service than any other medium, and it is a valuable way of communicating and for the government to make sure that Australians are well informed on the Voice debate regardless of whether they intend to vote yes or no. Publishers are saying to me that if this is allowed to stand, the strongest criticism of the referendum in rural an regional Australia, which is that it is a flawed mechanism focused on the power centres of Canberra and our capital cities, will be reinforced by this decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Mayo for bringing this motion before the House, and I encourage the government to support our regional print media.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  Can I thank you, Deputy Speaker, for bringing this motion on in your role as the member for Mayo. I am one of those members of parliament who is a former print journalist. I hesitate to say 'former'; I think you're born a journalist and you die a journalist. It worries me greatly, to be utterly frank, to hear the reports from you and the member for Gippsland that advertising is dropping off in regional papers. I will follow that up. I will undertake to do that because that does concern me greatly. But I must say to the member for Gippsland that this issue predates this government, and it certainly predates the government you were part of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was a journalist at an independent local paper in WA, we had the challenge daily with the fact that our paper did not get the level of advertising it should have from government departments and councils, despite having demonstrably higher readership than the corporate owned rival, which was co-owned by Murdoch and the West Australian Group, later bought out by Seven. That's because of the cosy relationships that advertising purchasers have with the big conglomerates. It's easy to make one phone call and one purchase so it goes into a national spread, and then they don't have to make multiple phone calls to independent regional publishers. That's what is needed; we need cultural change from the buyers of advertising. I don't think those decisions are being made at the bureaucratic level, and certainly not at the ministerial level, but it does concern me that the word is not getting out to the buyers of advertising on behalf of the government that they must ensure that there is a good spread of advertising in regional newspapers, whether it's in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania or wherever the case may be. So I will take that up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate in the north-west happens to be very well served by local papers.

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These papers are a mix of commercial and non-profit. Some are traditional newspapers and others are printed on A4 photocopier paper. Some are independent. A handful are owned by bigger companies or councils. What they have in common is being grounded in their communities and being highly valued by those communities. Some have cover prices, others cover their costs by selling advertising space, and some do both. As you would expect, I'm a regular advertiser in all of them. I also contribute stories and story ideas. As a former print journalist, I recognise the incredibly important role these publications play in community life. They inform the community about what's going on, not just in the news but also in community life. There has been so much talk over the years about the destructive role of the internet on newspapers, and rightfully so. Audiences are fractured. Masses of advertising have moved online, especially ads for jobs, real estate, cars and second-hand goods, once referred to as the rivers of gold. Saturday newspapers used to be four times as thick as they are now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's not discussed nearly as much as the role the internet plays is the essential role that government advertising can play in the survival of regional newspapers. I don't think we should be supporting regional newspapers out of some nostalgic hankering to hang on to the past. Newspaper production is slow, laborious, expensive and resource intensive. It makes a lot of sense to replace it with the immediacy of the internet and the lower barriers to entry. The problem is that in regional areas you won't get a regional internet equivalent to a regional newspaper. It just will not happen. So we need to make sure that we protect our regional newspapers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key way we can do that is by government mandating a certain level of advertising spend in regional newspapers and, I would say, independent local papers in the suburbs and the metros, because they all play an important role. The big corporates can look after themselves, but our regional papers are the lifeblood of their local community. They deserve our support, they need our support and we should be supporting them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I'd like to thank my friend the member for Jagajaga for moving this motion. I also thank the Minister for Aged Care, the member for Lilley, for her work in helping lift the standards of our aged-care sector. I think how we look after our aged in our community reflects how we as a society view some of our most vulnerable people. Aged care should not an afterthought of government, nor should key investment and quality standards in aged care be neglected. Sadly, this was the attitude of the previous government, who reluctantly agreed to convene the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, with much prodding, and then chose to delay acting on the commission's findings. This was not only shameful but also a poor reflection of what the Morrison government thought of residents and workers in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, things have changed for the better. I'm proud to be part of a government which cares, commits and carries through for aged-care residents and workers, and is getting on with addressing the recommendations of the royal commission—all of them. So far, we've directly addressed 37 of these recommendations, whereas during their time in government those opposite completed a mere six per cent of the 148 recommendations made by the royal commission, with the then minister for aged care, Senator Colbeck, refusing to accept that aged care was in a state of crisis. 'Shocking' does not adequately capture their lack of action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Combining the measures from the legislation that we've passed and the two budgets that we've delivered, we've addressed in full or in part a total of 69 recommendations, and we've got no plan to stop our work in reforming and transforming the sector, which was really left to rot under the coalition. It is something that all Australians can be proud of. At the heart of this sector is the workforce who, day in and day out, deal with residents who are ill, frail and stressed and who, from time to time, pass away. In aged care these days it's much different than it was 20 or 30 years ago. Patients are sicker, more dependent and older and have more physical and neurological demands. It's a mentally and physically demanding job. That's why our record 15 per cent pay increase for Australia's aged-care workers is so significant. It's significant not only because it's the largest pay rise ever for this workforce but also because it will go a long way in increasing workforce participation and morale and reducing turnover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pay rise is also a reflection of our government's approach towards this sector and our strong belief in improving quality and care for those within it. Whilst I'm again proud to be part of a government that has delivered this important milestone, it's shocking that only now are these experienced, hardworking aged-care workers earning over $30 an hour. This shows the distance that we must still go towards providing adequate support for this workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another aspect of aged care we are working on is our commitment to increasing transparency over public dollars going into aged care as part of our plan to put security, dignity, humanity and accountability back into the sector. From January 2024 our government will provide a full picture of how residential and aged-care providers are spending their money so that residents and taxpayers can see how much is spent on components of residents' care such as diet and nutrition, personal care et cetera. People will be able to vote with their feet and leave a provider whose performance on these critical measures is poor. This greater transparency will help rebuild trust in the sector and provide assurance for those already in care and for taxpayers that providers are spending money as they would expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment also addresses the royal commission's finding that there's a lack of publicly available and high-quality information to help older Australians make effective comparisons between aged-care services. In my electorate of Macarthur we have some wonderful aged-care providers such as Estia Health Kilbride, located in Gilead, which I've visited on a number of occasions, as well as IRT Macarthur and Uniting Home Care in Campbelltown. I had the privilege of visiting Estia Kilbride with the now assistant minister, Ged Kearney, in 2021. Together we met with staff and residents to discuss their concerns and hopes for better policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some of the many steps that we are taking to help residents and staff in the aged-care sector. I'm proud of the way the aged are cared for in my electorate and I'm proud of the way our government is addressing the needs of some of the most vulnerable in our society. There's much more to do, and failings of the past need to be corrected, but I'm optimistic that aged-care people in Australia will get the care they deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  You never know, when members draft these motions, whether or not the passage of time makes them begin to regret them or whether perhaps their minister from the government didn't quite keep the member updated as to whether or not the government were on track to, indeed, keeping promises they made at the election. In this case it's regarding aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice that the first point here commends the government for delivering the 15 per cent pay increase in their budget. The government submitted to the Fair Work Commission to not give a 15 per cent pay rise. Their explanation was that they wanted to spread it over two years. With inflation running at seven per cent, if that maintained itself, an increase of 15 per cent would actually see the aged-care workforce going backwards, which is what the government sought: we don't want to give you 15 per cent straightaway; we want to spread it over the next two years. It's the kind of fine print that never seemed to be used in the election slogans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, this motion talks about increasing average care minutes and doesn't, interestingly, talk about the government's promise to have a 24/7 registered nurse at every aged-care facility in the country by 1 July 2023, which is less than 10 days away. Why? Because that's not happening. The government has now conceded that they won't be achieving the 24/7 nursing standard that they said they would put in place, leading up to the election. Why? It was for the exact reason that we said, honestly, during an election campaign: that the commitment would be misleading the people of this country because the workforce capability didn't exist to put in place 24/7 nursing in every residential aged-care facility. Worse still, if the government forced that commitment, as Labor in their election campaign said they would do, you would see two things happen. Firstly, aged-care facilities would close down, and/or secondly, other vital health services would lose their nursing staff, because aged-care facilities who are forced to employ nurses 24/7 could only poach them from other parts of the health system, where I promise you those nurses are doing vitally important work, particularly in regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a government that went to an election with a whole range of slogan promises in aged care that since the election, miraculously, are not being delivered. We were honest with the people of this country and said there were challenges in implementing some of the recommendations from the royal commission, particularly 24/7 nursing care. The now government very irresponsibly said, 'No, you've just got a government that's not prepared to listen to an outcome of the royal commission and implement those recommendations,' when we were always absolutely committed to doing so at the first opportunity that it could be done. Now, of course, the chickens are coming home to roost, and the people of Australia are seeing those promises that the government made for what they are—hollow promises designed to trick people into supporting them so they could get into government. Now it's all unwinding as we predicted during the election campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no delight in this from our side of politics, because there's nothing more low and disgraceful than misleading people about something as vital as aged care and saying to people during an election campaign, 'We're going to do all these things,' that they absolutely knew could not be done. It was particularly low to try and delay the 15 per cent pay rise. To go to an election and say, 'We're going to give you a 15 per cent pay rise,' and then as a government say to the Fair Work Commission, 'We want that spread out over a couple of years, actually, to get a budget saving,' is particularly low. So this motion surprises me. I take the opportunity to speak on it, because, if I were the government, the last thing I'd want to be doing is talking about my record in aged care and, in particular, highlighting the broken promises—the commitments that were taken to the last election. There were promises made that I'm sure a lot of people believed. They took the now government at their word that they would deliver on those promises. Those people are now experiencing the heartbreak caused by the breaking of callous political promises made by a government that said what they needed to say to win votes. Now that they are in government, they are completely failing to keep their promises, which, I suspect, they always knew they would never be able to keep.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I don't know where the member for Sturt was, but things like workforce supplements and dementia supplements were all cut by the previous government. It was almost the first act of their tenure on the Treasury benches in relation to aged care. They couldn't find a budget or a MYEFO from which they didn't want to cut billions of dollars out of aged care. They shuffled the money around. In one budget they cut $3 billion out of aged care. We put $11.3 billion in the budget for 15 per cent pay rises to aged-care workforce salaries and wages, and they've got the gall to criticise us for that, when after nearly a decade in office they did nothing, except deliberately design to keep wages low in the sector. In fact, they cut the workforce supplements and the dementia supplements and the other kinds of supplements we provided under Living Longer, Living Better. Do you know why they cut them? It's because they were going to provide extra care and extra wages in the sector. That's why they cut them as a result of the Commission of Audit in 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So don't give us lectures when we put the money in the budget. Their budget showed cuts to aged care. Their MYEFO showed cuts to aged care. Our budget showed increasing funding to aged care. There was $36 billion in the last budget and $11.3 billion to provide funding for much-needed wage rises for nurses and personal carers and those people providing care for older Australians, many of them living with dementia in residential aged care. What we're doing is acting on the recommendations of the royal commission. I thank the member for Jagajaga for what she has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're doing here in terms of funding for aged-care pay raises is stage 2 of 3 of the Fair Work Commission journey on its final decision. The government's committed to the final decision on the Fair Work Commission. Those opposite couldn't find a Fair Work Commission hearing that wouldn't not support wage rises. They simply couldn't bring themselves to support wage rises in the childcare sector, the SACS sector or the aged-care sector. Don't give us lectures and be all preachy and sermonising about supporting people in the aged-care sector when you kept on cutting funding in the aged-care sector year after year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise what we're doing: improving standards, strengthening food and nutrition, making sure we've got monthly care statements in the sector, enhancing the star ratings system for better quality of care in the sector and expanding the existing quality indicator program for in-home services. That's what this government is doing in acting on the recommendations of the royal commission: increasing care on the ground and legislating for extra nurses in the sector. Those opposite didn't do that over nine years, not at all. We're providing additional assistance to residential aged care. We have a task force looking at reform in the future. The reform those opposite thought was necessary was cuts in the aged-care sector. That's their idea of reform in the aged-care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission handed down its decision, in terms of recommendations, about two years ago, and those opposite couldn't bring themselves to implement many of the recommendations at all. I want to commend the government for having directly addressed 69, almost half, of the 148 recommendations of the royal commission since coming to office. Those opposite were in power for about two years while the royal commission's recommendations lay dormant, languishing, while they didn't act upon them. The reality is that the aged-care system in this country has been in crisis for years, and they lacked the wisdom and the wit to do anything about it. Lethargy, inertia and idleness were the views of those opposite. A recurring number of ministers saw the aged-care sector as a stepping stone. Poor old Minister Colbeck really struggled all the time, all the way through. Like with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, those opposite, in government, couldn't find a way to fund it, and they couldn't find a way to support it, but they found a way to cut it. That's what happened every single year.</span>

A huge percentage of people were malnourished and starving, with maggots in their wounds.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  The member for Blair, who just spoke, put across the government's arguments. I've been around this aged-care issue since the Hawke government. There have been difficulties, of course, as the aged-care sector evolved and changed, and I've said this many times before. In the last year of the Howard government, I went to see the Prime Minister about something. He said to me, 'Russell, I hope you're not here again on aged care, because we haven't got any more money to give them.' We had increased the money, nearly doubling it, year after year because of our aging population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was always going to be pressure put on a sector whereby, in the fifties, sixties and seventies, people would go into an aged-care home, sometimes as young as 50, as a care facility. It was used as a community care facility. Some people would go in and would have been there for 10, 15 or 20 years, living a great life, many of them very well. In those days, I remember few in high care. High care was when people, strangely, lived longer, but not now. It is because of the care that we give them, the drugs that are available to them and the attention that they get.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neglect cannot be put on any one of the nursing homes and aged-care facilities in my electorate. I've had to write to my aged-care sector, every one as individuals, and say to them, 'It's not you they're talking about.' But they say, We're being tarred with the same brush.' I say, 'No, you're not,' especially my not-for-profits. Have I had complaints over the years? Yes, I have, but not about any centre that I have personally attended or been invited to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care sector has really struggled over the past two years to get staff, especially in regional areas. When you pay them more, you say, 'That's great for the staff. They're being paid more money by this new government.' But then the people in disability are saying, 'Well, if they're getting that much in aged care, I'm going to go and work in aged care.' So you distort the market of where people might go and work. So then NDIS comes in and says: 'We'll pay you more. You come and work in the NDIS. You can work with people with disabilities. We will pay you more.' So then the aged-care sector loses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they said we're going to introduce 24-hour nurses, I thought it was a laudable idea. Fantastic. I love it. That means Mrs Jones down on the corner, who may have gastroenteritis, is checked on that day and she's not waiting for the GP to come a week later, which may be too late. Mrs Jones may be so dehydrated she may pass away. That has happened. There's no doubt about it.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the most expensive nursing homes there have been people who've been treated badly and not cared for properly. There's no doubt about that. So it's not the money you pay to go into a nursing home; it's the actual care you get within the nursing home, so who the people are and how they attend to their responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to admit to all the accusations that were thrown by the member for Blair. I'm not going to, because every government, to my knowledge, has done the best they can in the aged-care sector, having regard to the budget that was available to them. I remember when Kim Beazley was giving his valedictory speech. He said in that valedictory speech what the Hawk government would have given to have a $1 billion surplus or a $100 million surplus, but, for years and years, this nation couldn't ever get itself into surplus until the Howard government came along. So the aged-care sector benefited from one of the wealthiest governments since the gold rush. The Howard government was able to pour an enormous amount of money into aged care that benefited every community—small, large, country, regional—in Australia. Thank you, John Howard.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  I rise in support of this motion acknowledging the significant process that the Albanese Labor government has made in aged care, and I want to thank the member for Jagajaga for bringing this motion forward and providing this opportunity to talk about this incredibly important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of all, I do want to acknowledge the progress in aged care and the priority that our government has placed on aged care. In particular, I acknowledge the incredible work of the Minister for Aged Care, Anika Wells, over the year that we have been in government, not only for the things that have been achieved in that relatively short time but also, importantly, her acknowledgement of the importance of having ambition for aged care. The minister spoke about this at an address to the National Press Club recently, and I was really pleased to be there in person. This shouldn't be a significant thing that we say we have ambition in aged care, but it is because we have not seen that for such a long time. I think it's really significant, when we have been talking about aged care a lot in the political sphere—for as long as I can remember—and at a time when we have had a royal commission, which has exposed some of the most harrowing experiences of Australians in aged care and that showed that over 30 per cent of people had substandard experiences in aged care, that this is the first time we are starting to talk positively about it, because it is something that should be positive. It should not be normal that Australians are actually fearful of themselves or their loved ones going into aged care. When the minister spoke at the Press Club, she was the first Minister for Aged Care to speak at the Press Club. I found that so surprising, given this has been one of the key policy issues of our recent memory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister finished her speech on a personal note. When she was studying, she worked in aged care, and her mother worked for 15 years in aged care. It really resonated with me, because she said that when she was working there the problems that she saw were the same problems that she saw coming in as a new minister a year ago and visiting aged-care facilities all around the country. This resonates with me because, as I have talked about before in this place, both my grandmothers were in aged care here in Canberra. Their experiences were the same things, the same issues we are still dealing with. When the royal commission came out, I honestly felt that, while a lot of the stories and findings that came out were completely unacceptable, they were not surprising to anyone who has had a loved one in aged care, because we had seen many of those things happen. I have spoken before in this place about it. When my grandmother was in aged care here, staff would be very dedicated and would work really hard to do their best, but with the resources and the staffing shortages they just couldn't care for the residents in the way they wanted to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That really did resonate with me, and I'm very proud that our government is putting that ambition into this and wanting to see improvements. In particular, we have recognised the dedication and hard work of aged-care workers by announcing a record 15 per cent pay increase, representing the biggest ever pay rise for aged-care workers—overdue and much deserved. These people are doing some of the hardest and most important work in this country. At the many aged-care facilities I've visited here in Canberra, and going back to when my grandmothers were there, these workers care so much. We need to support them in that and the incredibly important work they are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has also committed to improving the facilities and quality of aged care for aged-care residents and has legislated for 24/7 nurses and increased came minutes, which will allow those workers to actually spend that time with the residents and ensure that they are getting the care they deserve. I have run out of time to talk about all the achievements we have made in just a year, but I think ambition is a really important part of this. We actually want to see this as something we can be proud of, and we want people to be able to look forward to the care that they will receive.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion that has been brought by the member for Jagajaga regarding the aged-care sector. All Australians want and expect our older Australians to be well supported and cared for in our community, including and particularly in residential aged-care homes. The opposition remains committed to supporting the health, safety and wellbeing of older Australians and understands the important role of healthcare providers, care workers and nurses play in ensuring that support is provided in the residential aged-care settings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was listening to the honourable member talking about her experiences with her grandparents. I can even remember being taken to see my great-grandmother many, many years ago. At that stage it was in a facility in Sydney, and she was in one room with seven other women, and they were taken out of bed each morning, put on a chair and left there for the entire day. I was a very little girl at the time, but I still have that visual. I am most relieved that these days we are providing technology and our understanding of aged care has moved on so that we are no longer treating our elderly as if they are patients in a hospital—I think that's probably the best way of putting it. A long time after that, my mother's mum, my nanna, also in an aged-care facility towards the end of her life. She did receive very good care, but I could see firsthand the experiences of the aged-care workers and how under-resourced and overworked they were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Hughes, I have over 15 aged-care facilities that offer just over 1,600 residential places. I take this opportunity to thank everybody within my electorate who works within the aged-care sector, whether they be the doctors, nurses, cleaners, cooks or the helpers. I particularly acknowledge those who are working in some of the higher needs facilities, particularly in dementia and Alzheimer's wards. The work that they are doing in those facilities to provide quality of life to our elderly in their last stage—to provide them with stimulation and activities to keep them engaged—is phenomenal work. I recently visited HammondCare over in Hammondville, St Vincent's Aged Care Heathcote as well as IRT Thomas Holt Kirrawee Aged Care Centre and Catholic Healthcare Percy Miles Villa at Kirrawee. Again, I say thank you to everybody, particularly in my electorate, who is working in those facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has sought to act on some of the recommendations that have come out of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. There were some very shocking findings that came out of that. Unfortunately, while the minister said she would put the care back into aged care, instead, we have had a number of aged-care homes close under the minister's watch. One, in particular, Wesley Vikery Sylvania, was very close to me—just outside my electorate—and is where many from my electorate had moved to live. So I think that there is still far more work that the government needs to do and that the minister needs to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy of having a 24/7 nurse in every facility is a beautiful dream. It is aspirational, but it simply has not worked, and we've seen that with the closure of these facilities, amongst other things. Again, I commend all of those in the aged-care sector. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Moncrieff for introducing this motion and for her continued work to protect the interests of young Australians. This motion allows me the opportunity to focus on super tax's effect on regional Australians. As we have seen time and time again over the past 12 months, under Labor's policies, the regions are set to do the heavy lifting once again—and with no safeguards in place, where we need them the most. We've seen, with regional health, the changes to the Distribution Priority Areas for GPs, which we worked so hard to expand for places like Cowper; a lack of safeguards for regional community pharmacies when changing the dispensing laws, which is an ongoing, serious problem; and the resulting and potential closures of critical healthcare facilities in our towns. I think 23 have closed since Labor's policy was implemented early. We've seen this with the ill-prepared move towards renewables. We're not against renewables, but there's nothing to replace them at the moment, and we've seen electricity prices skyrocketing across this country. Today the Wicked Elf brewery in my electorate—renowned across Australia; it's received awards—announced that it is closing its doors because it cannot pay its electricity bills; they've increased that much. We've seen a complete lack of infrastructure funding, with proposed projects that would have ensured better regional road services and communications cancelled or put on hold in order to funnel large sums of taxpayer money to Labor pet projects in metro areas, and now we're seeing it in superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the stories by the ABC and others, the effects of these changes to superannuation are not confined to people in Double Bay, Toorak or other affluent metropolitan suburbs around the country. In fact, in the vast majority of these cases these super funds won't be used to purchase yachts or luxury cars in retirement—which was so gleefully insinuated. These changes actually affect our businesses, like GPs, pharmacists and especially our farmers—those people who literally keep the economy going, keep food on our tables and keep health care afloat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard the average person ask, 'How on Earth do people have $3 million in their super?' Well, the simple answer is: land value. A considerable number of professionals, small business owners and farmers have placed their business premises or farms in their self-managed super funds because of the prospective capital gains tax advantages. These aren't people with waterfront mansions; these are people on farms and, in the case of pharmacists, for instance, their cash flow is next to nothing. Although they may be asset rich because of the increasing value of their land, they're technically cash poor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The implications of this scenario are more complex than my five-minute speech will allow, but the resulting outcome is that people with a business landholding in any kind of self-managed super fund may face considerable stress through liquidity difficulties in meeting what will be a crippling tax bill for unrealised capital gain. In a significant number of cases, forced land sales will prove to be the only solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will attempt to push this tax through, presenting images of super fund holders akin to Scrooge McDuck swimming in piles of money and laughing at those who are paying their fair share of tax, but the reality is quite different. While those on the other side of the floor claim that this will affect only 80,000 Australians, the Treasurer's own modelling shows that this number will drastically increase year on year, and it is specifically designed to do so in order to exponentially increase tax earned as a result of the policy—yet another tax by stealth, yet more smoke and mirrors, and not fiscally sound.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I rise to respond to this frankly ridiculous and misleading scaremongering motion that the opposition have brought today regarding superannuation tax. Frankly, it demonstrates just how out of touch they are with young people today. Maybe if they were really concerned about the future of our youth they'd have a coherent climate change policy. Maybe they'd have supported the government's bill for more social and affordable housing that they've joined with the Greens to further delay in the Senate today. Maybe they'd have backed our Secure Jobs Better Pay legislation to protect young workers from being ripped off by dodgy employers. Instead, we've got this motion about superannuation which is completely misrepresenting the government's policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has been completely upfront about the challenges that are facing the economy and the budget. We're making a modest adjustment to superannuation tax breaks for earnings on balances above $3 million, a change that will not come into effect until after the next election—99.5 per cent of Australians with super accounts will still receive the same generous tax breaks that they do now, and the 0.5 per cent of people with balances over $3 million, who this change will affect, will still receive tax breaks, just slightly less generous ones. So there are a few facts about our actual policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember what we're talking about here: we're talking about the superannuation system that Labor built, which is seen as a world-leading example. The opposition will always attack the superannuation system, because they don't believe in it. We will always protect it and make it stronger. The simple fact is that young people today can only even conceive of a super balance of more than $3 million because of the success of Labor policy in this area. But, of course, in conflict with what this motion suggests, the majority of young people will not have a super balance of more than $3 million. A young person earning $90,000 today, with an increasing salary throughout their life, will almost never accumulate $3 million in their super accounts. In fact, Treasury projects that in 2052 only the top 10 per cent of earners retiring that year will have more than $3 million in their super account. So it's pretty clear that the coalition are not talking to young people about the issues that are important to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a good opportunity to compare the pair here. Labor is offering changes to make super concessions fairer, and the Liberals are going after the most vulnerable with schemes like robodebt and attacking Medicare. Labor supports Australians with energy bill relief and more affordable housing for children and families fleeing domestic and family violence, but the Liberals want to die on the hill of stopping the 0.5 per cent of highest super balances from a modest tax reform. Labor backs action on climate and environmental law reform, and the Liberals want to put a nuclear reactor in your backyard. Talk about priorities!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's important for me to also note the sheer hypocrisy of this motion put forward today, because the former coalition government made changes to superannuation taxation which impacted eight times as many people as these changes do and lowered the contribution tax threshold without indexation. The coalition also continue to try to change the super system to force young people to raid their super for housing. While they present that as something helping young people, it is not. That's not what the superannuation system is for. That is actually forcing younger people to rob their future selves. We saw this in COVID, where that was the first place they sent young people to access money when they needed it. Perhaps, if they actually wanted to support young people through that crisis, they could have made the JobKeeper scheme eligible to casual employees, for example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is just another example of scaremongering from the opposition and being completely out of touch with the priorities of young people. I know that the young people in my electorate—and my electorate is actually the fourth youngest electorate in the country—want to see a progressive tax system that supports other priorities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  Labor members opposite say that Labor built super and they'll always protect it. They love to talk about Paul Keating as 'the king of super' and that Labor are 'kings of super'. The problem is that that's all, until you've got too much of it—then they want to come after your money! On 2 May 2022, the then Leader of the Opposition Albanese said, 'We've said we have no intention to make any super changes.' This is important, because it goes to character. He also said that life would be cheaper under Labor. He also said that he would lower electricity by $275—not once but 97 times! He also said at the Labor campaign launch in 2022 that they would lower mortgages. We've had only 12 interest rate rises since then! In the same month, he said, 'We have no intention to make any super changes.' He didn't just say 'some changes'. Yet earlier this year, less than 12 months after making that promise, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have announced that they're now making the very changes to super they said they wouldn't make. They're not just increasing taxes a little bit; they're doubling the tax rate if you've got too much money in super.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the reality of it. That is what they're doing. The facts are that a 20-year-old today—my eldest son is 20 right now—earning an average wage throughout their life will have a superannuation balance higher than $3 million when they're in their late 60s, meaning they will be hit hard by the doubling of Labor's superannuation taxes. That's a fact. Today Labor once again is trying to pull a con job on the Australian people. It's simply misleading to imply that this is a tax for the top end of town and that it won't affect young people in their late teens or early 20s today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that a dollar today is not what it'll be worth in 10, 15, 20 or 30 years time. This policy is not indexed, and the previous coalition speaker rightfully said that this tax is a tax on unrealised capital gains. You won't even have to be making money from the asset. They say housing goes up every 10 years. If you've got a house in Sydney or Melbourne and it's worth $1½ million today, it's probably going to be worth $3 million in 10 years time. What's it going to be worth in 20 or 25 years time? You don't even have to sell it. They're going to tax you 30 per cent on the unrealised capital gains. That's the Albanese government. They go on about super. The member opposite has talked about young people. Well, the First Home Super Saver Scheme is one of the best ways for young people to save for a house deposit right now. They can save $10,000—they can salary sacrifice into their super account—and, rather than being taxed at 32½ per cent on every dollar over $45,000, they're taxed at 15 per cent. The First Home Super Saver Scheme that the previous coalition government put in place is a great scheme for young people. All members should be telling young people about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this mob, the Labor Party, voted against it at the time: 'Oh no, the sky is going to fall in and we can't vote for that.' They've left it in place. Go to the front of my website, lukehowarth.com.au, and the first icon there is the First Home Super Saver Scheme. You can do it if you're in a Labor member's seat as well. If you haven't bought a house, get into the First Home Super Saver Scheme, particularly for young people living at home. Salary sacrifice into your super, get your deposit together and then take advantage of the coalition's First Home Guarantee, where you can get into the housing market with a five per cent deposit, and we'll pay the mortgage insurance. Labor don't want to talk about homeownership. They voted against the First Home Super Saver Scheme, and now the Leader of the Opposition is putting forward a policy that we'll take to the 2025 election, allowing super employer contribution to be accessed with a home deposit as well to help more young people—Gen Ys and Gen Zs—get into the housing market. Once again, this mob, the Labor Party, say the sky is going to fall in. The reality is that it's not, because most people will stay in a house for 10 years. They sell their house with a capital gain and they put the deposit back in, and a share of the capital gain. This mob is the Chicken Little mob—not us. The Albanese government need to learn to keep their election promises, because this is nothing short of another broken Labor promise.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  This is a motion for the books. The Liberal Party is tying itself in knots, trying to be on the side of younger Australians. This is the same party that for decades failed to take any action on the issues that matter to young people, and it is now trying to put itself on the side of younger Australians. What is one of the biggest issues young people care about at the moment? It's climate change. They are so concerned about it that thousands went on climate strikes in cities, suburbs and regional towns across Australia, urging their political leaders to do more to address climate change. What was the response from the former Prime Minister the member for Cook to these demands from these young Australians? He said, 'What we want is more learning in schools and less activism in schools.' Well, there probably could be a lot less activism if the political leaders had the courage and will to act on the things that young people care about. They failed to listen and they failed to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue which the member just spoke about is housing affordability. Young people are concerned that they are no longer able to buy a home or rent a place to live. Those opposite presided over a system where housing has become further and further out of reach for younger Australians. They oversaw a decline in social and affordable housing—a decline in the stock of housing supply that was coming on. The one big idea that they had to address housing affordability was to let young people raid their superannuation funds. The experts say that this could actually make the situation worse because young Australians would have less in their superannuation to draw on. Research from the Grattan Institute showed that the poorest 20 per cent of households headed by 35- to 44-year-olds, the group where homeownership is falling fastest, don't have any superannuation. So the coalition's policy of accessing super to pay for housing would primarily help wealthier Australians buy more expensive homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the motion moved by the member for Moncrieff. She doesn't want to help young Australians by acting on climate change. She doesn't really want to help young Australians with housing affordability. Instead, she thinks this is a silver bullet that will benefit young people. She comes in here opposing a superannuation change that affects those with super balances of over $3 million. What is this change that those opposite are so against that they think it will get them back into the good graces of young Australians? It's a modest tweak to the superannuation system. It currently impacts half of one per cent of superannuation balances. It amends the $3 million threshold for superannuation concessions in a way that strikes the right balance between incentives to save for retirement and strengthening the superannuation system by making it more sustainable over time. 'But what about the future impact?' those opposite say. Well, to put it into perspective, a young person earning $90,000 this year won't get anywhere near that $3 million threshold by the time they retire. In fact, Treasury projects that only the top 10 per cent of earners retiring in 2052 will have a superannuation balance of $3 million or over at retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite would actually stop and think about it, these changes are precisely aimed at helping younger Australians. We currently have an ageing population. That means we will need to spend more on health and aged care to help support this ageing population. If we don't make the hard choices now to reform, it means younger Australians will be left to shoulder the extra tax burden. This is a modest adjustment to superannuation tax breaks impacting just 0.5 per cent of people. That those opposite—who saddled future generations of Australians with a trillion dollars of debt, who failed to act on climate change and who are failing to address housing affordability—are now in here purporting to be on the side of young Australians, frankly, is excruciating to watch.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  It's been good hearing Labor members talk about how fantastic this policy change in superannuation tax is, which is why I'm shocked they didn't raise it during the election campaign, because apparently there is so much merit in this, it's such a great idea and it's so obviously logical. But how many times did they mention it before the election, when they were asking the people of this country to put them into government? Never—not one single time. In fact, worse than that, the now Prime Minister game an ironclad guarantee that he would not make any changes to the tax treatment of superannuation. According to those opposite, this policy is so fantastic and so logical and makes so much sense—apparently it's good for old people and young people—that they never mentioned it once during the election campaign. What an oversight of the tactics committee! They could have won even more seats by telling the people of this country that once they got in they were going to start coming after their superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember well the campaign and talking to people about superannuation, and some did say: 'Look, we know Labor have learnt a lesson when it comes to chasing superannuation. Bill Shorten lost the last election because he was going to come after our super, James, and there's no way, no risk whatsoever, that Labor will repeat the mistakes of the 2019 election and come after the hard-earned savings that we rely on for security in our retirement. Anthony Albanese has committed not to do that.' Well, surprise, surprise: a broken promise! Surprise, surprise: it's at the first opportunity after an election, not before the election. Don't go being honest with the people of this country, Madam Deputy Speaker, and actually tell them what you're going to do when you get in. Instead, promise you won't do something, get elected and then break that promise by introducing a raid on the retirement savings of hardworking Australians. It is appalling and it is disgraceful. Now we've got the suggestion that it's a modest change. The 'modest change' is doubling the tax rate from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. That apparently is modest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard speakers say it's going to affect only 10 per cent of young people—only one in 10 people. Apparently, if you're successful and you're in the top 10 per cent of income earners as a young person, the Labor Party think you need to be punished. You've done something wrong. You need to pay a lot more tax because you went out and were successful. You did something with your life. Yes, you made money and, yes, you've paid your fair share of tax through a whole range of other taxes that are dramatically higher on high-income earners, but let's just punish you that little bit more. Let's just add the sting to the tail so that in your retirement you again pay a disproportionately high amount of tax. According to the Labor Party, 10 per cent of people deserve to be taxed that bit extra, because Labor are about the politics of envy. They don't like these people, because they've been successful. And, of course, they love raiding that superannuation nest egg.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The poor old member for Maribyrnong was honest. He told the people of Australia, 'We're coming after your super.' The problem there was that the Labor Party lost an election over it. So the now Prime Minister was much more clever than the member for Maribyrnong. He said: 'I'll show you how it's done. What you do is tell the people of this country you won't tax their super, get elected, and then, after the election, start raiding their retirement savings. That's the trick.' The poor old member for Maribyrnong has learnt a very important lesson from the Prime Minister: don't tell the people of this country the truth.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take the interjection about the trillion-dollar debt. You should have been here for one of your other speakers, who advocated that we should have spent more than we did on JobKeeper. Madam Deputy Speaker, we now have members of the government who are saying we should have spent more on JobKeeper and, in the same argument, complaining about the debt left behind from JobKeeper. Talk about hocus-pocus accounting! Talk about magic pudding economics! Apparently we should have spent more during the pandemic on JobKeeper and not incurred debt in doing so. It says it all about the mathematical capabilities of those in the government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish on this: it is absolutely appalling and outrageous to go to an election saying to the people of this country, 'We will not touch your superannuation or change the provisions that you've made for it,' take their votes, get elected and then break that promise at the first opportunity.</span>

                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  I thank the member for Moncrieff for the opportunity to speak on the subject of superannuation. Universal superannuation is a proud achievement of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments, and it came into being in 1992. The member for Moncrieff's concern for young workers, demonstrated by her motion, is, I hope, a measure of her strong support for universal superannuation and for the rights of young workers, because back in 1992 the former member for Moncrieff, Kathy Sullivan, and the rest of the coalition members voted against universal superannuation. They were wholly opposed, to the point where the then member for Bradfield, Mr Connolly, stood up in this place on 5 May 1992 and spoke on the third reading of the bill, saying, 'This is simply a sordid deal between the government and the ACTU.' Further, he said it was only the Liberal and National parties who would stand and demonstrate that 'compulsory superannuation legislation of this nature is fundamentally flawed'. He referred in his speech to the year 2020 and stated that the legislation would not address the fiscal challenge of a greying society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, here we are in 2023. It is worth considering just how much superannuation an ordinary 20-year-old worker, to refer to the member's motion, would have had in their superannuation account today if the coalition had managed to prevail in 1992 and thereafter. The 20-year-old would be 51 years old today. I'm not 51 myself yet, but it's a pretty familiar age to many people here. How much would that 51-year-old have in their superannuation? Nothing, nil, zip, zero. Fortunately, Paul Keating and Labor did prevail in 1992, and as a result the average 51-year-old worker today has a super account of hundreds of thousands of dollars and growing, because compulsory superannuation isn't fundamentally flawed, as the coalition bleated in 1992; it's excellent. Australians now have a total of over $3.5 trillion invested in superannuation, and our retirement savings system is the envy of most of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the member for Moncrieff brings motions into the House on the subject of superannuation, she might want to consider her party's hopeless record in this area. Obviously, and as the Treasurer has stated on this matter, future governments and parliaments will have something to say about super. If an average 20-year-old today is looking at a super balance of $3 million some 40 years down the track—and that would be a good thing, although I don't think the member's maths will stack up—then future governments will need to consider what to do about that. This motion isn't about deep-seated concern held by the coalition for retirees in the year 2063; it's a furphy. This motion is all about the coalition scrabbling about fiercely to arrest the slide of their vote among young Australians right now, in 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANU found only one in four people under the age of 40 voted for the coalition in 2022, the lowest percentage since their records started in 1987. At the election a year ago, young voters took a good, hard look at the coalition and emphatically said no. They said no for lots of reasons. I'm sure very few of them were thinking about their retirements in the 2060s when they voted. The reasons young voters turned away from the coalition are, according to the surveys, climate change, integrity in politics, cost of living and housing—all areas where the new government has been very active. Just a few days ago the Prime Minister announced a further $2 billion for social and affordable housing, because regardless of the Liberals conveniently ignoring the government's mandate and the Greens simply ignoring reality, we have a mandate to act on housing, and we are acting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To return to super, what young people might like to consider in the area of super is just how much the coalition has, in fact, cost young people through their delays in increases to the superannuation guarantee. The delays occasioned by coalition governments—about seven years worth of delays over the past decade—must have reduced the eventual super balances of young people by tens of thousands of dollars. Further, we have enacted payday super to take effect from July 2026. The coalition were told about the need to take action on unpaid super way back in 2015 by the National Audit Office. They were told that 690,000 Australian workers were being dudded to the tune of $2.6 billion every year, and they squibbed it. It must have cost young workers thousands since then. Labor has acted. We on this side are very happy for the coalition to keep bringing motions on superannuation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thursday 15 June last week marked World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. It's a timely reminder for all of us in this place that we must do everything that we can to end the scourge that is elder abuse. Elder abuse is any act which causes harm to an older person and is carried out by someone they know and trust. The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety was established on 8 October 2018. One of the terms of reference for the royal commission referred to examining mistreatment and all forms of abuse. Many of the commission's findings were shocking, not least when it came to uncovering the prevalence of elder abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The office of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety estimates that around 39.2 per cent of people living in Australian aged-care facilities experience elder abuse. They experience it in any number of ways. They can suffer neglect, emotional abuse and physical abuse. But elder abuse is also more wide ranging than just these three forms. Financial, social and sexual abuse may also be experienced. Internationally, the UN estimates that about one in six people over 60 years of age experienced some form of abuse in community settings in the past year. Worse still, rates of elder abuse increased during COVID-19. No older person should ever be subjected to abuse, never, and it beholds each of us to be on the lookout for elder abuse, to look out for the signs and to see the red flags in whatever settings they may be found. The Elder abuse phone line is an excellent initiative and one I commend. In New South Wales we have our own Ageing and Disability Abuse Helpline, and I'm aware of other services around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is a day that we can highlight the needs of our elderly in general, and I'm proud of the government's record in this area. The most recent budget is a good example because it is a budget that very much addresses the recommendations of the 2018 royal commission. We are helping our elderly by providing them with up to $500 towards their electricity bill. We're helping them reduce the cost of their medicines. But the one I'm particularly delighted with is the Albanese government's $11.3 billion commitment over four years to fund a 15 per cent increase to the wage of many aged-care workers. The wage increase will take effect from 30 June. This initiative will help build a skilled aged-care workforce, one that can better deliver the high-quality aged care older people deserve. This is transformational change. It is a change that will make a real difference, a life-changing difference, to thousands of elderly Australians around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government's record goes further. This year's budget also allocated more funding for an additional 9,500 home-care packages. The initiative will allow more elderly Australians to get the care and help they need to live at home with dignity and respect. This government leaves no one behind. That's why the budget also included funding for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care Program. This additional funding recognises the higher cost of delivering residential care in remote locations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not pretend that the job of improving our aged-care system is completed—far from it—but the royal commission provided us as a parliament and as a nation an opportunity to stop, assess and, more importantly, commit to do better. Our oldest Australians deserve nothing less, and they deserve to age with dignity. The journey to delivering a world-class aged-care system is well underway, and I look forward to future Albanese Labor budgets, which will take us further along that journey. We should all commit to improving the quality of our aged-care system, and by acknowledging that elder abuse still exists we can also ensure that it is not acceptable and, moreover, ensure that there are enough safeguards to stop it happening at all.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I rise to support the motion. I thank the member for bringing this motion to the chamber and giving us the opportunity to talk about this important topic in a spirit of bipartisanship. Indeed, elder abuse is something of great concern to me and, I know, to all of us. As leaders in our community, I think we've got to be looking for every opportunity to identify new and developing elements and examples of elder abuse. Where we need to take action as a parliament, we should absolutely do so. But also, as community leaders we need to make sure we set a standard and at times, where it is warranted, call out the poor behaviour of people who are preying on older Australians. It's a very happy reality that we're living longer—we're all happy about that—but that brings about its own policy challenges for government, particularly around aged care and ensuring that governments are supporting people who are living longer. There's also, regrettably, a role for government and parliament in looking at where we need to tighten legislative frameworks and take action where there are areas of abuse and the taking advantage of older people—hopefully in anticipating them but even when they are developing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure all members have had come to them older people who have been taken advantage of, perhaps by certain scams that older people are more vulnerable to be exploited by. I have to say that at times there has been poor behaviour from corporate Australia. The banks, the telecoms and others, frankly, have not been as reasonable as they should when people have been mistreated or misrepresented into undertaking contractual commitments around phone contracts or into signing up for credit cards or when their data has been stolen and people have acquired their information and exploited them financially. Our consumer laws should err very much on the side of being very reasonable to victims, particularly vulnerable victims. Elderly Australians have been a high proportion of victims of certain criminal activities, particularly around identity theft and online scams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased that the previous government undertook the royal commission into aged care and disability care. There were some awful examples in my home state of South Australia, particularly around government service provision. There was one awful aged-care facility in particular that was run by the state government in South Australia for the most vulnerable aged-care dementia patients. They were treated absolutely atrociously. The silver lining from that awful experience, which was absolutely harrowing to learn about, is the dramatic change we hope, assume and count on being put in place not only in the way the South Australian government operates facilities but in the standards and more-robust frameworks for accreditation and community visitation and the like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID revealed further elements of support that is lacking for older Australians, particularly around some of the loneliness around COVID. Where elderly Australians are left in vulnerability, it tends to be associated with the fact they have not got the companionship and support in place to protect them and look after them. I'm a strong advocate for, and will support the government in, anything they're looking to do to enhance and improve services, particularly community based services for older Australians. We recognise the continuing growth in the need for services and that there are some difficult intergenerational decisions that will have to be made around how we meet the resourcing requirements. One thing we should all be committed to is giving older Australians the absolute highest standards of support and care they deserve. We all have members of our family who are going to avail themselves of a range of those services, as will we ourselves, probably, and we as a government and a parliament should do everything we can to support those services being of the highest standard possible.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="290544" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  Vulnerability is bimodal in Australia for all of us. Peak vulnerability occurs at two points in our lives—at the very start of our life and right at the end of our life. This is pertinent because it's something that I saw and dealt with as a general physician. When I practised, I did encounter, on many an occasion, patients who had suffered elder abuse. They were overwhelmingly women and they presented with all kinds of ailments, but overwhelmingly most of these patients were in fact malnourished. In some cases they were cachectic, which means that they were wasted. And they were universally fearful of discussing their experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in Australia there are around 4.2 million people who are 65 years and over. They comprise around 16 per cent of our population. That number is expected to double, to nine million, over the next 25 years. These older Australians, or seniors, are our parents, our grandparents, our aunts and our uncles. They deserve, as they enter a more vulnerable phase of their lives, to remain protected and to feel safe wherever they are, whether that be in the community or, in the case of some Australians, as they transition to residential aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue is that elder abuse is more prevalent than we think. It affects one in six community-dwelling elderly. This is based on a survey that was done in 2021, the National Elder Abuse Prevalence Study. What is most concerning, however, is that there is a real taboo around disclosing the experience of elder abuse. That is because it tends to be perpetrated by other family members, often children. It is much, much worse in patients or people who come from non-English-speaking backgrounds. They overwhelmingly feel the shame associated with this and often do not even have the language to describe what is actually going on at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it falls to two groups to try and identify, or at least screen for, these problems. One is the aged-care sector and the second is the healthcare sector. I want to thank the member for Werriwa for bringing forward this motion and discussing the problems in aged care, which we are all familiar with, but the healthcare sector is a different beast. There are a lot of people around and multiple opportunities for health encounters both with doctors or allied health professionals or nurses, but you really do need to be clued in and you need to have structures in place. This speaks to the need for having health justice partnerships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was privileged enough in April this year to attend the launch of a successful pilot program by Eastern Health and the Eastern Community Legal Centre. The Attorney-General was present. The launch basically demonstrated that a successful health justice partnership, where a legal centre partnered with a major health network in Victoria, could lead to positive outcomes in the sense that they were able to identify and help at least half of all people who were brought forward as suffering from elder abuse. There were two programs that were highlighted. One was called the Rights of Seniors in the East, ROSE, and the other one was called Engaging and Living Safely and Autonomously, also named ELSA. That was a partnership with the Oonah Health and Community Services Aboriginal Corporation, because this is intersectional. It affects all communities, multicultural as well as mainstream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were thoroughly impressed with this program and, as such, the attorneys-general recently decided that they would invest in a national plan to ensure that we can keep this work going. In that respect, the Australian government—we, the Albanese government—have committed $4 million towards a campaign to educate the community on how to recognise abuse in the elderly. There's a national free call phone line—1800 ELDERHelp—and you can also go to the Compass website find further information, educate yourselves and educate your family members. I would urge you all to do that.</span>
