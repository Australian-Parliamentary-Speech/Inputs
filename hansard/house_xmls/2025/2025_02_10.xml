              <span class="HPS-Small">Thousands of families across Australia are suffering due to excessively long wait times for parental visas. These delays leave families fragmented, preventing them from sharing in important life events and providing essential support during challenging times. The emotional toll of prolonged separation is immense, causing anxiety and distress for both parents and children. This situation is not just an inconvenience; it undermines the fundamental values of family unity and support that are central to Australian culture. Every family deserves the right to be together, and it is unacceptable for loving families to endure such unnecessary hardship due to bureaucratic delays.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to take immediate action to reform the parental visa application process. Specifically, we urge the government to prioritize the processing times for parental visas. By streamlining these processes, families can be reunited more quickly, allowing them to support one another and contribute positively to Australian society. It is crucial to act swiftly to prevent further pain and suffering caused by unnecessary separation due to bureaucratic delays. Together, we can advocate for a more humane and efficient immigration system that prioritizes family reunification, ensuring that every family has the opportunity to thrive together in Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The government should adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging standard as a national priority to enhance digital communication. RCS offers a secure, interoperable platform that modernises traditional SMS by enabling features like end-to-end encryption, high-quality multimedia sharing, group chats, and real-time updates all without the need for third-party apps. Implementing RCS would promote competition for the consumer market, reduce dependency on foreign messaging platforms, and ensure that critical communication infrastructure meets the needs of modern society in a secure and accessible manner. We believe this is a necessary step to foster innovation and strengthen the nation's digital ecosystem.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to to take immediate action to adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging standard across all mobile networks and devices such as iPhone's and Android Phones within the country. This includes mandating its implementation as the default messaging protocol to replace outdated SMS technology, ensuring interoperability among service providers, and providing the necessary regulatory framework to protect consumer privacy and data security. By doing so, the government would foster a more secure, reliable, and feature-rich communication infrastructure that meets the demands of modern digital communication while promoting fair competition and innovation in the telecom sector.</span>

The annual global cost of lead exposure is US$6 trillion (2019)—7% of global GDP. A moratorium on all new 'lead mines' (where lead is the highest tonnage metal) especially 'greenfield' projects like Bowdens, will prevent land and water contamination of agricultural/grazing land/indigenous sites and reduce water, fossil-fuel and infrastructure requirements. 'Mining' existing lead from the built environment; and incentivising householders to replace lead with non-lead flashing, especially on rainwater collection roof areas; and industry to collect, transport and recycle lead radiation shielding, weights, pewter, brass, solder, spent ammunition along with used lead acid batteries; and to manufacture new lead acid batteries from 100% recycled lead; and 'export' lead ingots with the technology/policy to assist other countries to achieve lead circularity, will obviate the need for newly-mined lead, create a smarter world (more capable of solving the climate crisis), and create a lead-safe and climate-safe planet for future generations. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The current Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) law unfairly penalises small businesses that provide essential support to their employees. While FBT was originally designed to prevent the misuse of benefits in lieu of salary, it has inadvertently created a barrier for businesses wanting to provide crucial support, such as food and water, and health-related assistance. This law must be reformed to enable small businesses to support their employees better without facing prohibitive tax consequences. Many employees earning under $90,000 annually struggle with the rising cost of living, particularly for essential items like food and health services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to consider FBT exemption for a maximum cap of $6,000 per annum on food, non-alcoholic beverages, and health support provided to each eligible SBE's employees. This exemption would be limited to employees earning an annual taxable income of $90,000 or less. The rationale behind this proposal is straightforward: small businesses should not be discouraged from offering basic support to workers who need it the most. The proposed exemption would encourage small businesses to invest in their employees' health and well-being, promoting a more productive and engaged workforce. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Families with children who have disabilities face significant financial challenges due to the limitations of the current Childcare Subsidy (CCS). The CCS cap is the same for all families, but for those whose children require specialised care—often involving higher staff-to-child ratios and tailored support—the costs are much higher. This creates a financial burden that many families cannot bear.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Without affordable childcare, parents are forced to reduce work hours, leave their jobs, or use inappropriate care options because they cannot afford the specialised services their children need. For families already managing the daily complexities of raising a child with a disability, this added financial pressure causes significant stress and isolation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Specialised services like Ruby &amp; Ollie's All Abilities Childcare provide the critical support these children need, but due to the CCS cap, families are left with large out-of-pocket expenses, further straining their finances.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While we understand that certain occupations, such as nurses, are receiving expedited visa processing, we feel that this priority system has resulted in unfair treatment of many other applicants.

Many of us have families and personal plans that are being disrupted due to these delays, and it is time for the Department of Home Affairs to address the backlog.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Roughly 740,000 4G phones will be unable to make calls to 000 and emergency services if the 3G network is shut down. In 2023, almost 3 Million devices in Australia were reported to be reliant on 3G Network infrastructure, including many phones, cars, EFTPOS machines, tablets, and security cameras. An estimated 200,000 of these devices are medical alarms. A 3G Shutdown would render these unusable, with the user possibly unaware until the device is needed. Not only does a rushed 3G Network shut-down put lives at possible risk, it can likely cause millions of otherwise functioning devices to be discarded, further impacting environmental conservation efforts. Improper electronics disposal may also cause contamination of air, soil, dust, and water with toxic chemicals</span>

We urge the House of Representatives to ensure marginalised communities or areas are not left behind, and Australia continues to provide equitable access to the vital infrastructure maintaining principals of equitable access and affordability, something carriers pushing for the 3G Shut-down and mandatory device upgrades that are otherwise unnecessary have yet to prove.</span>

The Albanese Government has failed to implement this. This is not just an issue for the states, the federal government has the power to require public hospitals to provide these services. At a time when reproductive healthcare has become a subject of debate in multiple jurisdictions, mimicking the United States, it is more important than ever to increase access. Currently, abortion services are a postcode lottery in Australia. Between high out-of-pocket costs, a scarcity of abortion clinics and the widespread refusal of religious providers to offer this form of healthcare mean that reproductive services are inaccessible and remain stigmatised. Rural and remote Australians feel this burden significantly. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">It's 2024, there should be no need for PAYG individuals to even be concerned with how their income tax works, let alone need to do a return every year. The system for such individuals should be entirely automated and work in the background with no intervention from the tax payer unless issues arise. This has been the case in the UK for many decades now and I do not believe anybody alive today there has ever done their own end of year tax unless they run a business. It's high time Australia caught up in this regard. This would also cut annual costs down to the average resident by eliminating completely all bills paid to tax accountants except for business purposes, so all tax paying residents will benefit from this change. </span>

The current gap in legislation does not allow for wrongfully imprisoned individuals to receive legal compensation for their time served. The financial, physical, social and psychological struggles exonerees face after prison is in every way attributable to errors in judicial processes. International law details the right to compensation as necessary if a person is subject to arbitrary detention. The lack of consistency, transparency and accountability displayed through current compensatory pathways is not reflective of a fair and equitable system. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Light aircraft, tail number VH-MDX a Cessna 210, went missing on the 9th August 1981 over the Barrington Tops NSW with five men on board. Despite the initial &amp; continuing ongoing foot searches over the last 43 years, no trace of the aircraft or occupants have been located. Given the difficult topography of the terrain &amp; dense vegetation, foot searching is difficult, abhorrently slow &amp; also very dangerous. People are putting their lives at risk in trying to locate the aircraft. But above all, its the five family's still waiting for news of their lost ones still 43 years later. Its time these missing men are finally found &amp; returned to their respective family's finally giving them closure.</span>

This could include modern state of the art remote sensing equipment not available in 1981. LIDAR flown at low level by UAV or helicopter could possibly locate the aircraft below the vegetation. The use of SAR (synthetic aperture radar) is another option, possibly available through RAAF, ADF or Army. Lastly, Further on foot search efforts coordinated by the Army.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We ask the House of Representatives to restore the original Reduced Input Tax Credit (RITC) interpretation that has been in place since the introduction of GST legislation in 2000. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RITC is a Goods and Services Tax (GST) rebate on certain fees charged through a platform. Historically, it allowed Funds and IDPS Operators to claim a rebate from the ATO on the GST applied to financial advice fees, effectively providing investors with a 75% discount on the GST charged on these fees. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In July 2024, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) altered its interpretation of the RITC, resulting in super funds and IDPS operators losing the ability to claim this rebate on behalf of their members. This change has effectively increased the GST on clients' advice fees from 2.5% to 10%, representing a 7.3% overall increase in the fees charged to clients. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Previously, a client receiving a $1,100 (including GST) advice fee would have received a $75 credit, resulting in a net payment of $1,025. As of July 1st, 2024, clients are now charged the full $1,100. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It's important to note that no legislative change has prompted this; rather, the ATO has reinterpreted long-standing legislation, despite numerous private rulings supporting the original interpretation. This reinterpretation amounts to a hidden tax increase, further exacerbating the rising cost of financial advice for Australians, especially at a time when accessible financial advice is crucial. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

These assessments are crucial for individuals to access support services, educational accommodations, and workplace adjustments.

Without a diagnosis, they are left without access to essential resources that help them manage daily life and reach their full potential.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The government should adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging standard as a national priority to enhance digital communication. RCS offers a secure, interoperable platform that modernises traditional SMS by enabling features like end-to-end encryption, high-quality multimedia sharing, group chats, and real-time updates all without the need for third-party apps. Implementing RCS would promote competition for the consumer market, reduce dependency on foreign messaging platforms, and ensure that critical communication infrastructure meets the needs of modern society in a secure and accessible manner. We believe this is a necessary step to foster innovation and strengthen the nation's digital ecosystem.</span>

This includes mandating its implementation as the default messaging protocol to promote the technology, staying away from SMS, ensuring interoperability among service providers, and providing the necessary regulatory framework to protect consumer privacy and data security. By doing so, the government would foster a more secure, reliable, and feature-rich communication infrastructure that meets the demands of modern digital communication while promoting fair competition and innovation in the telecom sector.</span>

Numerous instances, both abroad and on Australian soil, have demonstrated how this practice undermines social cohesion and national security.

This is a social, health and financial burden which extends into general health and wellbeing, also putting additional strain and costs on Medicare as patients seek generally ineffective or palliative management through Medicare subsidized GP's for dental diseases. </span>

We find that the common experience of casual workers in Australia is routinely working full-time hours or more, with no leave entitlements, and being vulnerable to workplace abuse. Due to the inherent insecurity of their contracts, casual employees are necessarily reluctant to raise complaints, because doing so puts them at risk of suddenly losing work. For this reason, we ask that all employment contracts, whether casual or permanent, include guaranteed hours and notice of termination, as the absence of these entitlements enables employers to exploit the threat of job insecurity to impose unreasonable conditions. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Over 7 million Australian's live in rural Australia, contributing over $500 billion to our economy. Yet they are disproportionately impacted by limitations in maternity services. Since the early 1990s, the number of babies born before arrival has increased by 50 per cent nationally. Alarmingly, over half of rural maternity services, or more than 140, have closed since then, placing women and their babies at greater risk of adverse outcomes including mortality and roadside births, and placing increased financial and psychological stress on the woman and her family.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A strong private health system is essential for the sustainability of Australia's healthcare system.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Private hospitals not only provide critical services and reduce pressure on the public system, but also offer 'competition' to public health services offering patients choice and access to high levels of specialised care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Without appropriate funding, private hospitals face significant challenges threatening the safety and quality of care they provide. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This situation could also threaten private healthcare generally, risking a collapse in the function and effectiveness of private health insurance. The impact on the public system would be catastrophic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that private hospitals can continue to meet the needs of Australians, it is crucial to address the current and ongoing funding gaps—which has forced over 70 private hospitals to close.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This can be achieved not only through public-private partnerships, government incentives, and policies that support both private health insurance and direct funding for private healthcare providers, but also through the fail-safe of an Independent Private Health Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With a well-supported, stable, and fair private hospital system, Australia's healthcare system can continue to deliver safe, efficient, and high-quality care for all citizens through this unique balance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Ombudsman already has the responsibility to oversight and resolve issues within private health, but it is clear that this process is not working.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While addressing climate change is essential, Net Zero by 2050 is unrealistic given Australia's economic and technological landscape. Key industries, including energy, mining, and manufacturing, will be severely impacted by such a rapid transition. Without adequate technological solutions and time for industries to adjust, the policy will lead to job losses and undermine economic stability.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I propose a more achievable target of 48% emissions reduction by 2050, which allows for gradual progress without compromising economic competitiveness. This approach offers time for innovation, industry adaptation, and sustainable job creation, while maintaining fiscal responsibility.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The new media-ban affecting under 16s is quite disastrous. Many teenagers use social media to connect with friends, entertain themselves, or have a break from reality. Some even use social media as their only source of income, either to support themselves or their family. Some use social media as a cry for help. Connecting with others and having someone who can't judge you for your upsetting thoughts can really support your mental health. By taking away social media from teenagers, you are taking away friendships, support, excitement, happiness, and for a lot of people, the only reason they can still enjoy life.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The planned closure of the Artarmon Post Office will leave the community without accessible postal services, forcing residents and businesses to rely on a facility located 1.79 kilometers away. This poses significant challenges, particularly for elderly residents, people with mobility issues, and local businesses that depend on convenient postal services for their operations. The closure risks disrupting the daily lives of the community and diminishing its overall functionality and convenience. Relocating the post office to a nearby site within Artarmon is essential to ensure that residents and businesses continue to have access to these critical services, preserving the integrity and vibrancy of the community. This is why we are urgently requesting action to address this pressing issue. </span>

The goal is to identify and establish an alternative site before or shortly after the planned closure on 12 March 2025, ensuring uninterrupted access to these vital services.</span>

It will also reduce CO2 emissions by around 321 million tonnes by 2050. Without the Standard, transport is projected to become Australia's largest source of emissions by 2030. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 7 November 2022 regarding a petition requesting homeworkers have the ability to install of data cabling for their own internal computer networks (EN4318 refers). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, I apologise for the delay responding. As you may be aware, this petition was not received by my office until 25 July 2023. I then understand it was assigned to an officer in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts for investigation, but that officer subsequently left their position without finalising the investigation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My department has since sought information from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) as the agency responsible for administering the regulation of telecommunications customer cabling. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACMA has advised that the customer cabling regulatory framework is designed to ensure the safety of end users and cablers, as well as protecting the integrity of telecommunication networks. The installation of data cabling (telecommunications customer cabling) concealed within a building cavity can lead to an electrical safety risk if not installed in accordance with the regulations. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, there are low-risk tasks that can be undertaken by end users (including homeowners) safely without a registered cabler. For example, an end user may install cabling that connects modems, routers and printers to a home computer network—provided that the cabling is not concealed in a building cavity and is connected using customer equipment and cables that comply with applicable technical standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A registered cabler will need to be engaged for the installation of any customer cabling in the home that is concealed within a wall, floor or ceiling cavity. The ACMA offers advice on finding a registered cabler on its website acma.gov.au/find-registered-cabler. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Types of Cabling Work Declaration 2013</span>, which specified what is and what is not considered to be a type of cabling work was due to sunset on 1 April 2024. After public consultation the ACMA made the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications (Types of Cabling Work) Declaration 2024</span>. The new Declaration largely replicates the previous one, with minor changes to enable end users to perform low-risk tasks in certain circumstances, and to improve clarity. Further information on the new Declaration can be found via acma.gov.au/telecommunications-types-cabling-work-declaration-2024. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ACMA staff can assist the principal petitioner and others if they require any additional information about the regulatory arrangements for customer cabling. Enquiries can be directed to trdsenquiries@acma.gov.au. </span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Higher Education Loan Program</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 June 2023 regarding Petition EN5045 on fee changes for higher education psychology courses. I apologise for the delay in responding. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2024-25 Mid-Year Economic Fiscal Outlook, the Albanese Government announced an additional $2.5 billion investment in higher education over the next 10 years. This includes the establishment of the Australian Tertiary Education Commission (ATEC) to lead reform over the longer-term including through implementing Managed Growth and Needs-based Funding to ensure more students can access, participate and succeed in higher education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also recently announced a series of measures that will provide significant relief for students. This includes a commitment to reduce every Australian's Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) debt by 20 per cent. This will benefit 3 million Australians and will wipe $16 billion in HELP and other student debt. An individual with a HELP debt of $27,600 will see $5,520 removed from their outstanding student loan. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Alongside this, the Government will change the repayment system and increase the amount people can earn before they are required to start repaying their student loan. This means people with a HELP debt will only need to start repaying once they earn $67,000 rather than the current $54,435. It will also reduce the size of repayments per year. For someone on an income of $70,000, this will mean they will pay around $1,300 less per year. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These commitments build on the significant reforms the Albanese Government is already implementing. This includes making the indexation of HELP debts fairer, cost of living relief for students, support for people from the outer suburbs and regions to go to university and structural reforms to our tertiary education system. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">University Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024</span> that passed the Parliament on 26 November 2024 delivers the first measures in response to reforms recommended by the Universities Accord. This includes capping the HELP indexation rate to the lower of either the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Wage Price Index (WPI), establishing for the first time a new Commonwealth Prac Payment for those studying teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work, and massively expanding FEE-FREE Uni Ready courses. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The change to HELP indexation applies retrospectively from 1 June 2023 and will benefit all Australians with a student loan. It will fix the issue of last year's spike in the CPI indexation rate of 7.1 per cent and will prevent growth in student debt from outpacing wages growth in the future. These changes apply to all HELP, vocational education and training Student Loan, Australian Apprenticeship Support Loan and other student loan accounts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) started processing indexation credits in December 2024, which will be for the difference between the indexation rates that applied in 2023 and 2024 and the updated indexation rates. This will provide relief for students while continuing to protect the integrity and value of the HELP system, which has massively expanded higher education access for millions of Australians. For an individual with an average HELP debt of $26,500, around $1,200 will be wiped from their outstanding student loan. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on how announced changes may benefit those with a HELP debt is available using the HELP debt reduction and repayment estimators at www.education.gov.au/higher-education-loan-program/20-reduction-student-loan-debt. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new Commonwealth Prac Payment will be available from 1 July 2025 and is expected to support around 68,000 eligible 1teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students in higher education to complete their practical training each year. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">FEE-FREE Uni Ready courses are free courses that effectively provide a bridge between school and university. They give students who need them the foundational skills to succeed at university. Our amendments provide a massive expansion of these important, life changing courses from 1 January 2025. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the issues raised in Petition EN5045 regarding funding for psychology courses. The Government is committed to improving the mental health and wellbeing of all Australians. As announced in the 2023-24 Budget, we have invested $91.3 million to address acute bottlenecks in the psychology training pipeline. This includes incentives for universities to create 500 additional postgraduate psychology places in relevant areas of endorsed practice. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Funding arrangements for psychology courses were set by the previous government through their Job-ready Graduate scheme. Their changes decreased base funding for postgraduate psychology and significantly increased student fees for Commonwealth supported students studying Organisational Psychology and relevant courses leading to general registration. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Universities Accord made several recommendations relating to the previous government's Job-ready Graduates scheme, including that student contributions for Commonwealth supported students studying humanities, communications, other society and culture, and human movement1 units should be reduced, and that student contributions should move toward a system based on projected potential lifetime earnings of graduates. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As I've said in the Parliament, the Accord is a plan not for one budget, but a blueprint for the next decade to help us build a better and fairer education system. Further consideration will be given to other Accord recommendations in future budget processes and based on advice from the ATEC regarding higher education pricing matters, once it is established. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence dated 1 August 2023, to the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon Murray Watt, concerning Petition EN5162—ban on the synthetic meat trade. I apologise for the delay in responding. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The red meat industry remains an integral part of the Australian agriculture sector and a key contributor to our nation's economic prosperity. The Australian Government continues to work closely with the industry towards greater trade, animal welfare and sustainability outcomes and acknowledges its essential role in meeting the Australian agriculture sector's goal of agricultural production being valued at $100 billion by 2030. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government believes there is room for industries producing both traditional and emerging sources of protein to thrive. This will be essential as we look to meet the increasing protein demands of a growing global population. The Australian cell-cultured food industry is emerging and is primarily in the research and development phase. Research by CSIRO has identified a $13 billion market opportunity for Australia to grow and diversify its high-quality protein products from various sources. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Current regulatory arrangements and principles are effective at protecting the environment and the health of Australians. In Australia, the regulatory approval of sale of novel foods, including cell-cultured meat, is managed by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), the independent food standard setting agency for the joint Australia New Zealand food regulation system. Existing regulatory arrangements prevent food being sold in Australia—including imported food—that does not meet the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are currently no cell-cultured meats available for consumption in Australia. The first application for cell-cultured quail is currently under consideration by FSANZ. This application is classified as a 'Major Procedure' requiring two rounds of public consultation. FSANZ completed the first round of public consultation on this work in February 2024. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following consideration of submitter feedback and available evidence FSANZ prepared a draft variation to the Code. The second round of consultation on draft regulatory measures is now underway via FSANZ's Consultation Hub at consultations.foodstandards.qov.au. Consultation closes on 24 December 2024. I encourage the public to engage in this consultation. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5368 on removing the automatic excise tax increases on alcohol. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Biannual indexation in accordance with the Consumer Price Index is a longstanding feature of the alcohol tax system. It ensures that alcohol excise amounts keep pace with inflation and that the tax component of alcoholic beverages remains broadly stable as a proportion of their total price. Without biannual indexation, the real value of alcohol excise would fall over time as alcohol prices rise in line with inflation. </span>

Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Migration Strategy released on 11 December 2023 outlined the Government's vision for recalibrating student and graduate visa settings to support both the education sector and Australia's migration needs, while simplifying Australia's migration system.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Changes from the Migration Strategy will ensure Australia attracts and retains the skilled workers it needs while addressing the number of 'permanently temporary' visa holders under previous arrangements. The Government recognises the valuable contributions which migrants have made, including injecting valuable skills into our labour market and enriching our communities.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Skilled—Recognised Graduate (subclass 476) visa was capped on 22 December 2023 and closed permanently on 1 July 2024. The Migration Strategy confirmed the visa no longer aligned with policy priorities, added to the complexity of the migration system and recognised that internationally trained engineers could apply for other visas that allow them to work or migrate to Australia.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Tertiary Education: Unpaid Clinical Placement</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding Petition EN5988, in relation to expansion of the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) debt reduction program to include all health workers completing unpaid clinical placements. I apologise for the delay in responding. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2024-25 Mid-Year Economic Fiscal Outlook, the Albanese Government announced an additional $2.5 billion investment in higher education over the next 10 years. This includes the establishment of the Australian Tertiary Education Commission (ATEC) to lead reform over the longer-term including through implementing Managed Growth and Needs-based Funding to ensure more students can access, participate and succeed in higher education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also recently announced a series of measures that will provide significant relief for students. This includes a commitment to reduce every Australian's HELP debt by 20 per cent. This will benefit 3 million Australians and will wipe $16 billion in HELP and other student debt. An individual with a HELP debt of $27,600 will see $5,520 removed from their outstanding student loan. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Alongside this, the Government will change the repayment system and increase the amount people can earn before they are required to start repaying their student loan. This means people with a HELP debt will only need to start repaying once they earn $67,000 rather than the current $54,435. It will also reduce the size of repayments per year. For someone on an income of $70,000, this will mean they will pay around $1,300 less per year. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These commitments build on the significant reforms the Albanese Government is already implementing. This includes making the indexation of HELP debts fairer, cost of living relief for students, support for people from the outer suburbs and regions to go to university and structural reforms to our tertiary education system. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The University Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024 that passed the Parliament on 26 November 2024 delivers the first measures in response to reforms recommended by the Universities Accord. This includes capping the HELP indexation rate to the lower of either the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Wage Price Index (WPI), establishing for the first time a new Commonwealth Prac Payment for those studying teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work, and massively expanding FEE-FREE Uni Ready courses. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The change to HELP indexation applies retrospectively from 1 June 2023 and will benefit all Australians with a student loan. It will fix the issue of last year's spike in the CPI indexation rate of 7.1 per cent and will prevent growth in student debt from outpacing wages growth in the future. These changes apply to all HELP, vocational education and training Student Loan, Australian Apprenticeship Support Loan and other student loan accounts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) started processing indexation credits in December 2024, which will be for the difference between the indexation rates that applied in 2023 and 2024 and the updated indexation rates. This will provide relief for students while continuing to protect the integrity and value of the HELP system, which has massively expanded higher education access for millions of Australians. For an individual with an average HELP debt of $26,500, around $1,200 will be wiped from their outstanding student loan. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on how announced changes may benefit those with a HELP debt is available using the HELP debt reduction and repayment estimators at www.education.gov.au/higher-education-loan-program/20-reduction-student-loan-debt. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new Commonwealth Prac Payment will be available from 1 July 2025 and is expected to support around 68,000 eligible teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students in higher education to complete their practical training each year. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Placements are an important part of qualifications for a range of professions that ensure graduates have the skills and experience to enter the workforce and translate learned theory into practice. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government understands that placements can impact a student's financial wellbeing and appreciates the challenges many students experience with meeting the cost of living while studying and completing mandatory placements. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is the first time the Government has provided financial support for mandatory placements. We are starting with students studying nursing, midwifery, teaching, and social work as recommended by the Australian Universities Accord. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As I have said, the Accord is not a plan for one budget, but a blueprint for the next decade and beyond. Consideration is being given to other recommendations in the Accord, including that the Government work with tertiary education providers, state and territory governments, industry, business and unions to consider further support by employers (public and private) to mitigate the risk of financial hardship and placement poverty for students in other fields.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also increased support available to students through Austudy, ABSTUDY, Youth Allowance and provided access to more Government Rent Assistance as part of the 2023-24 Budget. These payments support Australians of all ages to attend university to pursue their career ambitions. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the request to include other health related courses in HELP debt reduction programs. The Government has already implemented measures to reduce outstanding HELP debts of teachers, including early childhood teachers, who have completed four years working in very remote Australia. A similar measure has been implemented for eligible doctors and nurse practitioners who live and work in rural, regional or very remote areas of Australia. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Independent reviews of the doctors and nurses HELP reduction initiative will be undertaken in 2025 and in 2028. These reviews will consider expansion of HELP reduction initiatives to other sectors of high skills experiencing similar workforce challenges. The Government will evaluate the effectiveness of the program and may consider any recommendations to expand these measures to other sectors in future budget processes. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 June 2024 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition EN6091, with 4,543 signatures, concerning the proposed <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Amendment (Removal and Other Measures) Bill 2024</span> (the Bill). Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long history of generous migration and humanitarian resettlement programs. Our migration framework underpins these programs and ensures that those who have a right to enter and remain in Australia are afforded that right and opportunity. This framework also relies on the Australian Government having the ability to remove non-citizens once they no longer have a lawful right to remain in Australia. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia makes every effort to cooperate with countries on the return of their nationals to their home country when they have exhausted all avenues to remain in Australia. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The powers in this Bill to designate a removal concern country recognise that there may be some countries that obstruct or do not facilitate the return of their own citizens from Australia. The Government understands the serious nature of this designation, and the making of such a designation would only be considered following significant Government to Government engagement on the issues and challenges of returns, and where doing so is in Australia's national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the Bill allows for the power to be exercised in a flexible and scalable way, and contains appropriate exemptions, for example, for close relatives of Australian citizens or permanent residents and for offshore humanitarian entrants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN6091 to my attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Tertiary Education: Migration Law</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 July 2024 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP enclosing Petition EN6250, with 99 signatures, concerning the requirement for prospective Registered Migration Agents (RMAs) to complete the Capstone Assessment (the Capstone). Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention and have passed on the feedback in the Petition to the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In order to be eligible for registration as an RMA under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span> (Migration Act), a person must first complete a prescribed qualification (being a Graduate Diploma or Master degree) offered by specified education providers. Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Agents Regulations 1998</span>, the Minister may also prescribe an examination for the purposes of satisfying vocational requirements under the Migration Act. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration (</span><span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">MM</span><span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 18/003: Specified courses and exams for registration as a migration agent) Instrument 2018</span> prescribes the Capstone as this examination, requiring an RMA to pass the examination before being registered. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that the Capstone contributes to the time and effort required to become an RMA, and that the nature of examinations can be stressful. I also recognise that satisfying the qualification and examination requirements require significant financial investment. However, in light of the important service that RMAs provide in supporting potentially vulnerable migrants to navigate the complexities of our migration system, it is essential that new RMAs are well prepared.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Capstone was introduced in July 2018, following a finding by the I (the Kendall Review). The Kendall Review found that existing entry requirements for prospective RMAs were inadequate, and did not properly prepare agents for practice. The Capstone ensures that all prospective RMAs have a deep knowledge of migration law and procedure prior to entering the industry. The examination is standardised, meaning all prospective RMAs are assessed by the same criteria, regardless of when or where they completed their prescribed qualification. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I draw your attention to recent changes in the delivery of the Capstone, which have had a positive impact on the success rate amongst candidates. This includes a consolidation of the written assessments, and an expanded oral test component. The implementation of these changes from October 2023 resulted in a 61 percent pass rate for the October 2023 intake, compared to 44 percent for the July 2023 intake. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The changes also resulted in a reduced fee for the Capstone—from $2,690.00 to $2,156.00. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the Petition expresses concerns about the fee charged for the Capstone. While the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration (Specified courses and exams for registration as a migration agent) (Capstone provider) Amendment Instrument (LIN 21/044) 2021</span> nominates Legal Training Australia (LT A) as the provider of the Capstone, the instrument does not specify the fee to be charged for exam candidates. The fee is determined and charged by the LTA. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, you may be aware that the Department has undertaken to remake a number of legislative instruments in the RMA regulatory framework, prior to their forthcoming sunset in April 2026. This will include the remake of legislation relevant to the prescribed examination. I will ensure the feedback from the petition is considered in this process. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing Petition EN6250 to my attention. </span>

The National Domestic Violence Order Scheme (NDVOS) is a model law statutory scheme under which States and Territories automatically recognise and enforce one another's DVOs. It is currently underpinned by an interim information-sharing solution that leverages the National Police Reference System (managed by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission) to provide police and courts with information on DVOs issued across Australia. The NDVOS and the interim system help improve police situational awareness when responding to domestic violence incidents, improving both victim and police safety, and ensure local courts can recognise, amend and othe1wise effectively deal with DVOs, even if issued interstate. The Attorney-General's Department is also currently progressing a review of family and domestic violence order frameworks. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email to the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, the Prime Minister dated 8 October 2024 regarding petition number EN6428, which requests the House to appoint a Minister for Men and Boys. The Prime Minister has asked me to reply on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the Governor-General appoints Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister, rather than the House, and I am responding on that basis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a decision of the Prime Minister as to what ministerial portfolios he recommends to the Governor-General as part of the Government. Among these is typically a Minister for Women, which has existed in various forms in governments going back to the first Hawke Government in 1983.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that women face significant social and economic challenges, and continue to be disproportionately impacted by family, domestic and sexual violence. Sixty-four women reportedly lost their lives as a result of violence in Australia in 2023 and 66 women have lost their lives since 1 January 2024. Rates of violence are even higher for First Nations women, women with disability, migrant and refugee women, LGBTIQ+ people and other minority and marginalised groups. Women also experience tech-based abuse more frequently than men and the abuse is often more severe in its nature and damaging in its psychological impact, leaving women twice as likely to fear for their safety compared to men.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Insights to economic challenges faced by Australian women are enabled by longitudinal data. The Government has published a snapshot of this data in the 2024 Status of Women Report Card, which can be accessed via the Australian Government's gender equality strategy website (https://genderequality.gov.au/status-women-report-cards/2024-report-card).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The latest remuneration average gender pay gap provided by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) is 21.8 per cent, with women earning 78 cents for every dollar men earn. This equates to women earning, on average, $28,245 less each year. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The most recent data at the time of writing from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), shows that women spend nine hours a week more than their male counterparts on unpaid work and care. This impacts their lifelong economic security by limiting their labour force participation, career progression, and leadership opportunities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additional data from WGEA and the ABS consistently shows that women are overrepresented in lower paid, more casualised sectors, including early childhood care and education, aged and disability care, and underrepresented in higher paid sectors, such as mining and engineering. Women are also underrepresented in leadership and decision-making roles, and are more likely to retire with lower superannuation balances than men. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The challenges that women face in working the hours and jobs they want also impacts the health and wellbeing of men and boys and addressing these challenges benefits men and boys. This work will support men to become more active parents, more highly engaged in home and family life, work flexibly, access paid parental leave and take on greater caring roles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These challenges require concerted and coordinated whole-of-government policy responses to successfully address, led by a dedicated Minister for Women.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges that men and boys face specific issues, particularly in relation to mental health and suicide. The Government considers that these can be better addressed by targeted policies and programs, rather than a dedicated Minister for Men. In particular, the Government's framework for men's health is the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Men</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s Health Strategy 2020-2030</span>.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 8 October 2024, to the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Prime Minister, regarding <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN6454</span>, which requests the House of Representatives to call on the Prime Minister to establish a Minister for Older Australians. The Prime Minister has asked me to reply on his behalf. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the important role older Australians play in our community. In addition to the Hon Mark Butler MP, Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Hon Anika Wells MP, Minister for Aged Care, the Prime Minister recently appointed the Hon Kate Thwaites MP, as the Assistant Minister for Ageing, to ensure there is adequate representation in the Ministry on this matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government acknowledges the importance of the matters raised in this petition, it has not considered that establishing an additional Minister for Older Australians is necessary. The current Ministry appointments for the Health and Aged Care portfolio and Cabinet arrangements ensure that matters concerning older Australians are effectively represented and coordinated. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 8 October 2024 enclosing Petition EN6456, with 298 signatures, concerning the processing of Permanent Residence (Skilled Regional) (subclass 191) visa applications. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Migration is a critical part of Australia's social and financial development as a nation. Immigration provides our businesses with the skills they need, stimulates demand for goods and services, and increases our economic output. I am committed to maintaining strong borders and delivering an orderly and compassionate immigration strategy that is tailored to the needs of the nation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government released the Migration Strategy ("the Strategy") in December last year. A key objective of the Strategy is building stronger Australian communities by better planning the migration intake. This will better connect skilled migrants to Australia's skill needs, helping to reignite productivity growth, which will ensure rising living standards, business growth and better wages. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the number of on-hand visa applications, including in the subclass 191 caseload, has been a priority for the Australian Government. The Department of Home Affairs has been undertaking a range of measures to reduce the processing times for this type of application, and additional resources have been assigned to the caseload. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Skilled visa applications are processed according to government policy priorities, as outlined in Ministerial Direction 105. Under the Ministerial Direction, for applications which are not employer sponsored and in relation to an occupation to be carried out in a designated regional area, the highest priority is being afforded to those visa applications made in relation to healthcare or teaching occupations. Subclass 191 visa applications that are not made in relation to these specific occupations are given lower priority, and these applications are generally processed in the order in which they were received. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each application is unique and is required to meet the eligibility criteria contained in Australia's migration legislation, before a visa can be granted. The time taken to process an application varies depending on a range of circumstances, such as the complexity of the application and whether additional checks and further assessment are required. Some delays in processing are experienced due to character and security checks, along with verification of an applicant's claims. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More detail regarding visa requirements, processing priorities for skilled visa applications and processing timeframes is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website. Currently, 90 per cent of subclass 191 visas are processed within eight months, which is consistent with the processing times for other general skilled migration visa applications. The Department continues to process these applications efficiently, with the intention to further reduce the total number on-hand. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 October 2024 enclosing Petition EN6463, with 531 signatures, concerning immigration health examinations required for the Permanent Residence (Skilled Regional) (subclass 191) visa. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the petitioners' concerns related to costs associated with immigration, health examinations. Before a visa can be granted, each applicant must meet all of the legislative criteria for the visa, including the health requirement. The purpose of the health requirement is to protect the Australian community from threats to public health, contain public expenditure on health and community services, and safeguard the access of Australian residents to health and other community services in short supply. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are special health arrangements in place for those who hold or previously held (within the _last 12 months) a substantive temporary or provisional visa, and then apply for the corresponding permanent visa. Applicants who received a permanent health clearance for their Skilled Work Regional (Provisional) (subclass 491) visa are not ordinarily required to undertake any additional health checks for their subclass 191 visa application. This is in line with a health policy decision to exempt applicants from undertaking additional health screening at the permanent visa stage (the second stage) where they have completed all the required examinations at the provisional visa stage (the first stage), unless in the following situations:</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN6508 on indexation of study fee loans. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has heard a range of public concerns about student debts and current indexation and repayment arrangements. In response, the Government has announced a suite of changes to the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) and student loans system. These changes will make the operation of student loans simpler and fairer and reduce the outstanding debt of the 3 million Australians with a student loan by a total of around $19 billion.  </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2024-25 Budget the Government announced that HELP loans will be indexed at the lower of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Wage Price Index (WPI). The change was backdated to 1 June 2023, lowering the indexation applied to student loans from 7.1 per cent to 3.2 per cent in 2023 and from 4.7 per cent to 4 per cent in 2024. These changes have now been legislated and the Australian Tax Office will automatically apply these changes to people's outstanding debts in the coming weeks.  </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 November 2024, the Government also announced that it would apply a one-off 20 per cent reduction to all student debts. This will apply to individuals' outstanding debts before annual indexation is applied on 1 June 2025. In addition, from 1 July 2025, repayments of student loans will be made simpler and fairer, with the minimum income threshold for compulsory repayment increasing from $54,435 in 2024-25 to $67,000 in 2025-26, and the introduction of a system where repayments are calculated only on the income above the new $67,000 threshold, rather than repayments being based on total annual income. Under this new marginal repayment model no one will have to pay more than the current system, and every person earning under $180,000 will see a reduction in compulsory repayments.  </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 8 October 2024 enclosing Petition EN6518, with 323 signatures, concerning the processing times of Employer Nomination Scheme (subclass 186) visa applications. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Migration is a critical part of Australia's social and financial development as a nation. Immigration provides our businesses with the skills they need, stimulates demand for goods and services, and increases our economic output. I am committed to maintaining strong borders and delivering an orderly and compassionate immigration strategy that is tailored to the needs of the nation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government released the Migration Strategy ("the Strategy") in December last year. A key objective of the Strategy is building stronger Australian communities by better planning the migration intake. This will better connect skilled migrants to Australia's skill needs, helping to reignite productivity growth, which will ensure rising living standards, business growth and better wages. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the number of on-hand visa applications, including in the subclass 186 caseload, has been a priority for the Australian Government. The Department of Home Affairs has been undertaking a range of measures to reduce the processing times for this type of application, and additional resources have been assigned to the caseload. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Skilled visa applications are processed according to government policy priorities, as outlined in Ministerial Direction 105. Under the Ministerial Direction, applications for the subclass 186 visa are prioritised where an occupation is to be carried out in a designated regional area. Priority is also given to applications in relation to healthcare or teaching occupations. Subclass 186 visa applications that are not made in relation to these priorities are given lower priority, and are generally processed in the order in which they were received. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each application is unique, and is required to meet the eligibility criteria contained in Australia's migration legislation, before a visa can be granted. The time taken to process an application varies depending on a range of circumstances, such as the complexity of the application and whether additional checks and further assessment are required. Some delays in processing are experienced due to character and security checks, along with verification of an applicant's claims. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More detail regarding visa requirements, processing priorities for skilled visa applications and processing timeframes is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website. Currently, 90 per cent of subclass 186 applications are being processed within 6-12 months, depending on the chosen stream. The Department continues to process these applications efficiently, with the intention to further reduce the total number on-hand. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The signatories to this petition may be interested to know that the Government has increased the planning level for Employer Sponsored visa category from 36,825 visas in 2023-24 to 44,000 visas for the 2024-25 permanent Migration Program. This planning level builds on the expanded pathway to permanent residence introduced by the Government from November 2023. It will allow a greater proportion of temporary migrants to secure permanent residence in a timely manner through the Temporary Residence Transition Stream. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 October 2024 regarding a petition to allocate funding to veterinary hospitals and practices that treat wildlife patients—Petition Ministerial Referral (EN6532).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Wildlife carers, veterinarians and wildlife hospitals play an important role in caring for native wildlife. Wildlife rescue and care are primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments, though the Australian Government has provided support to the sector during the recent extreme and unprecedented 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires. Through the Saving Koalas Fund, the Australian Government is providing $19.5 million for koala hospital and koala health initiatives. These investments are primarily for the purpose of helping koalas, but also provide infrastructure and support to care for other native animals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, the Australian Government is also supporting actions that will lead to long-term recovery for threatened species listed under <span style="font-style:italic;">the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</span>. The Threatened Species Action Plan 2022-32 is helping to protect, manage and restore Australia's threatened species and important natural places. The Australian Government's $224.5 million Saving Native Species program is helping to implement this plan and look after our unique plants, animals and ecological communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing your concerns to the government's attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 8 October 2024 regarding petition EN6536.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition asks the House of Representatives to create a register of people who make false allegations about domestic violence. I note the petition raises concerns about false allegations of domestic violence resulting in imprisonment, as well as impacting on people's finances and family law proceedings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is firm in its view that domestic violence is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated, and is committed to ongoing improvements to the family law, courts and legal assistance systems to ensure that they support families to separate in a safe, child-centred, accessible and timely way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Australia's federal system of government, States and Territories are responsible for the majority of laws related to domestic violence, including the making of domestic violence orders and criminal offences. Each jurisdiction manages its own criminal justice system, including criminal laws, policing, courts and corrections. The following information is therefore focussed on the family law system, noting that the Attorney-General's po1tfolio has responsibility for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Act 1975 </span>(Cth).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition EN6536 raises concerns about the use of false allegations of domestic violence within the justice system. It is a role for the courts and, specifically, for family law court judges to consider the evidence presented, including allegations of domestic violence, and determine the weight it should be given. This is done on a case-by-case basis. The family law courts have broad powers to order costs against a party if false allegations or false denials are proven in court. In addition, a witness in proceedings who wilfully makes a statement significant to the proceedings which they know to be false, or do not believe to be true, may have committed the offence of perjury.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where there is an allegation of perjury, the court may refer the allegation to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for investigation. The AFP is operationally independent of Government and has authority to make decisions about whether or not to investigate an alleged Commonwealth offence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note the concerns raised in the petition regarding the misuse of systems. The Australian Government recognises this is a serious issue. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia has broad powers to manage the conduct of proceedings and can make orders to prevent misuse of court processes, including the power to summarily dismiss all or any part of proceedings that it considers frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the National Cabinet meeting of 6 September 2024, the Government committed to immediately commence an audit of key Commonwealth government systems to identify areas where they are being weaponised by perpetrators of domestic violence. The audit will include the child support, social security and tax systems and will leverage existing reviews underway that seek to strengthen these systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A Digital ID is simply a voluntary online method of confirming your ID that does not require physical documents once it's set up. It works by verifying your existing ID documents such as a passport or driver license against the official record held by government.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Consultation on the legislative framework of Digital ID extends back to 2017. Three rounds of public consultation on the policy and draft legislation were held across 2020 and 2021. Consultation on the proposed draft Digital ID Bill as well as the associated legislative rules occurred between September and October 2023. Feedback received from the consultation resulted in a number of key changes to the Digital ID Bill.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Digital ID Bill 2023 and the Digital ID (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023 were introduced into the Parliament on 30 November 2023 and referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 28 February 2024. The Senate Committee's report concluded that the Bills should be passed however, amendments were made to the Digital ID Bill to respond to the issues raised by the Committee's inquiry.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes all allegations of human rights violations and arbitrary detention seriously. We are deeply concerned by the reports of ill-treatment of Professor Al- Singace.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Embassy in Riyadh is accredited to Bahrain and closely monitors the human rights situation there. The Embassy regularly makes representations on human rights to the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain and engages in constructive bilateral dialogue on specific human rights issues, including freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and prisoner welfare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are also using our voice in international institutions and fora to call for the upholding of human rights in Bahrain. Australia has raised Bahrain's human rights record in the Human Rights Council. Our statement to the Universal Periodic Review Working Group in November 2022 expressed deep concern with reports of torture, enforced disappearance and abuse of detainees. It urged Bahrain to protect detainees against torture and other ill-treatment, uphold the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, end the ban on protests, and establish a moratorium on the death penalty with a view to its abolition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 October 2024, the Government received the final report from the independent panel appointed to review the response to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 Response Inquiry).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 Response Inquiry reviewed the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic to identify lessons learned and improve Australia's preparedness for future pandemics. The Inquiry consulted widely, receiving 2,201 public submissions representing a breadth of experiences and reflections across governments, business, community organisations, unions and everyday Australians. The Inquiry also held 27 roundtables with 300 individuals to test what worked well and what needs to change.</span>

The report identifies 19 immediate actions for the next 12-18 months, and seven medium-term actions prior to the next national health emergency. In line with the report, the Government is delivering on its commitment to establish an independent Australian Centre for Disease Control (CDC). The Australian CDC will ensure Australia has a national organisation than brings together critical information and experts to deliver coherent, timely health advice to improve health outcomes for the Australian population.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 4 November 2024 conveying petition number EN6581, which requests the Australian Parliament to recognise 16 September as 'Women, Life, Freedom' Day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government stands with the women and girls of Iran and Iranian human rights defenders in their ongoing fight for human rights and fundamental freedoms. I publicly condemned Iran's brutal crackdown of the Women, Life, Freedom protests sparked by the tragic death of Mahsa Jina Amini in September 2022, and supported calls by the Acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for a prompt, impartial and independent investigation into Ms Amini's death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since Ms Amini's death I have imposed sanctions against 200 Iranian individuals and entities, including those responsible for the oppression of women and girls. This includes Magnitsky-style sanctions I announced in December 2022 against Iran's Morality Police, the Basij Resistance Force, and six Iranian individuals involved in the crackdown, and further sanctions announced in September 2023 and 2024 to mark the anniversary of Ms Amini's death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has advocated for sustained international pressure on Iran for its treatment of women and Girls, including by delivering statements at the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council. Australia was at the forefront of efforts to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women in December 2022 in response to Iran's actions to continuously undermine and increasingly suppress the human rights of women and girls including by using excessive force.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In April 2024, Australia co-sponsored a resolution to extend the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights Situation in Iran and the Independent Fact-Finding Mission, the responsible mechanisms for investigating human rights violations stemming from Iran's violent repression of the 2022 protests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 17 September 2024, I issued a joint statement with the US Secretary of State and Foreign Ministers of the UK, Canada and New Zealand on the second anniversary of Ms Amini's death. In the statement, we acknowledged the ongoing unity of the Women, Life, Freedom movement and called on the new Iranian Administration to fulfil its pledge to ease pressure on civil society in Iran. I also conveyed these messages directly with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi on 26 September 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have passed a copy of the petition to the co-chairs of the Australian Parliamentary Group on Population and Development (APGPD) for their information and consideration. As you know, the APGPD works across party lines to champion women's empowerment and break down gender discrimination.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia remains steadfast in our determination to work with the international community to hold Iran to account for its systemic oppression of women and girls and to advocate for the human rights of all Iranian people.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 4 November 2024 regarding Petition EN6599 on a proposed National Youth Meet and Greet Day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the issues raised in the petition, including the challenges faced by young people and the importance of including young people in government decision-making. The Australian Government is committed to creating opportunities for meaningful engagement with young people to ensure their views are reflected in the policies and programs that affect them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the Government's Youth Engagement Model, the Office for Youth engaged over 4,600 young people from across Australia in 2023 to develop <span style="font-style:italic;">Engage! A strategy to include young people in the decisions we make</span>. This strategy, launched in March 2024, highlights 3 priority areas where we will recognise and listen to young people, empower young people to advocate, engage with and support government to work with young people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under <span style="font-style:italic;">Engage!</span> the Government committed to an annual National Youth Forum where young people work together to present policy solutions to the Australian Government. The first National Youth Forum was held in March 2024 at the National Museum of Australia and was attended by more than 100 diverse young people from across Australia. Topics for the forum were based on the top 3 issues raised by young people during the National Youth Consultations in 2023: mental health, climate change, and cost of living.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, under the Youth Engagement Model the Government provides funding to the Australian Youth Affairs Coalition (AYAC) to advocate on behalf of and support young people. AYAC has successfully supported the establishment of a Parliamentary Friends of Young People Group co-convened by Mr Andrew Wilkie MP, Member for Clark, and Ms Rebekha Sharkie MP, Member for Mayo. This Friendship Group provides a non-partisan forum for Senators and Members to meet and interact with young people and youth-led organisations to discuss matters relating to areas of policy that affect young Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Youth Meet and Greet Day had the opportunity to be presented and discussed at this Friendship Group and I will encourage AYAC to continue to support young people to advocate for this idea across the Parliament.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 November 2024 regarding Petition Number EN6614 request to increase Medicare benefits for psychological sessions to 26 sessions per year for individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note your recent correspondence of 3 June 2024 regarding a similar petition (number EN6102) to increase psychological sessions to a minimum of 20 sessions per year for individuals. A response to this correspondence was dispatched to you on 6 August 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As previously advised, increasing individual psychological session numbers as part of a tiered model of treatment carries a high risk of further entrenching inequities. An independent evaluation by the University of Melbourne found that providing additional services to existing consumers limited the capacity of providers to offer treatment to new users, with many people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and regional, rural and remote areas missing out.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Since my previous correspondence on 6 August 2024, I am pleased to add that the Department of Health and Aged Care has established the Better Access Industry Liaison Group (Liaison Group) which brings the sector together via 17 key stakeholder organisations including the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine and the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Liaison Group has been established to ensure there are no unintended consequences or patient access issues arising during, or as a result of, implementation of the changes to the Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule initiative as announced through the 2024-25 Budget.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also investing in complementary models of mental health care to ensure Australians get the right level of care for their level of need. In the 2024-25 Budget, the Government invested $361 million in the mental health and suicide prevention system. This includes:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 4 November 2024 regarding petition number EN6617.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the unique challenges and disparities rural and remote communities face when accessing health care. These challenges faced by rural and remote communities can include attracting and retaining health professionals to provide local primary care services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no one-size-fits-all solution to addressing health workforce shortages in rural and remote Australia. Standard solutions like traditional models of GP service delivery may not work in all communities. The primary issue for the rural health workforce in Australia is one of equitable distribution rather than undersupply. GP numbers in Australia increased at two and a half times the rate of population growth, however, the bulk of this growth has occurred in major capital cities and metropolitan areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to addressing these challenges to meet the needs of Australians in rural and remote areas by working to improve the capacity, quality and distribution of the health workforce.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Mid-term Review of the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA), published on 24 October 2024, made 45 recommendations including recommendations to improve health equity and outcomes for Australians living in rural and remote communities. Recommendation 36 was that the importance of improving equitable access to health care services in rural and remote areas should be reflected in a new and dedicated Schedule in a future NHRA Agreement.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 November 2024 enclosing petition EN6630, with 144 signatures, concerning the cost and processing times for Parent visas. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the important role family migration plays in delivering social outcomes for Australia and contributing to social cohesion by strengthening family and community bonds in Australia. The Family Stream of Australia's Permanent Migration Program seeks to facilitate the reunification of family members, including partners, children and parents, of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The number of places allocated to the permanent Parent program is decided annually as part of the permanent Migration Program planning process. The Government determines the number of places for the Migration Program following public consultations, and sets the program with Australia's immediate and longer-term economic and social needs in mind.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The permanent Parent visa program within the Family Stream consists of Contributory and non-Contributory visa subclasses. For program year 2024-25 (commencing on 1 July 2024), 8,500 places have been allocated to the permanent Parent visa program. This is the same number of places allocated for program year 2023-24.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of concerns about processing times and the cost of permanent Parent visas. Processing times for permanent Parent visa applications are impacted by a range of factors, including the number of places allocated to a program each year within the broader migration program and the level of demand. For a number of years, high volumes of permanent Parent visa application lodgements have exceeded annual migration planning levels, which has impacted processing times for permanent Parent visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visa Application Charges (VAC) are taxes imposed on visa applicants, including applicants in the Family stream, and are set by Government in accordance with policy objectives. As general taxation, all revenue is returned to Government to provide services to the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">VACs are subject to annual indexation, and a range of considerations are taken into account when setting them, including the Government's policy intentions and the size and composition of the Migration program. Parent migrants draw upon Government services over the course of their lifetime in Australia, and the VACs for Parent visas in most cases only partially offset the cost of Parent migrants to the budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the permanent Parent visa program, the Government facilitates short-term family reunification through temporary visas, which allow for a temporary stay in Australia, which can be utilised by parents of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens:</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Sponsored Parent (Temporary) (subclass 870) visa (SPTV) allows parents of Australian sponsors to visit Australia for up to three or five years at one time, for a combined maximum stay of up to 10 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Visitor visas are available for the purposes of a short term stay in Australia, including family visits. Visitor visa policy also allows for parents of Australian citizens or permanent residents to be granted Visitor visas with visa validity periods greater than the standard 12 months.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 18 November 2024 concerning petition EN6645 to the House of Representatives to allow Psoriatic Arthritis to be included in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) determines eligibility based on functional impairment, not diagnosis. This means no condition, including Psoriatic Arthritis, can be automatically included in the NDIS.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Anyone with a disability is able to access the NDIS if they meet the requirements set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013</span>, including age, residency and disability or early intervention requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Generally, a person will be eligible for the NDIS if their impairment is, or is likely to be, permanent and causes a substantial reduction in their capacity to do one or more daily life activities, including moving around, communicating, socializing, learning, undertaking self-care, or self-management tasks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many participants have medical conditions they manage alongside impairments arising from their disability. In making decisions, the NDIA must consider the roles and responsibilities of mainstream service systems, such as health, in supporting people with disability and fulfilling universal service obligations to all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 November 2024 enclosing Petition EN6687, with 280 signatures, concerning the processing of Permanent Residence (Skilled Regional) (subclass 191) visa applications. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Migration is a critical part of Australia's social and financial development as a nation. Immigration provides our businesses with the skills they need, stimulates demand for goods and services, and increases our economic output. I am committed to maintaining strong borders and delivering an orderly and compassionate immigration strategy that is tailored to the needs of the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government released the Migration Strategy ("the Strategy") in December last year. A key objective of the Strategy is building stronger Australian communities by better planning the migration intake. This will better connect skilled migrants to Australia's skill needs, helping to reignite productivity growth, which will ensure rising living standards, business growth and better wages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the number of on-hand visa applications, including in the subclass 191 caseload, has been a priority for the Australian Government. The Department of Home Affairs has been undertaking a range of measures to reduce the processing times for this type of application, and additional resources have been assigned to the caseload.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Skilled visa applications are processed according to government policy priorities, as outlined in Ministerial Direction 105. Under the Ministerial Direction, for applications which are not employer sponsored and in relation to an occupation to be carried out in a designated regional area, the highest priority is being afforded to those visa applications made in relation to healthcare or teaching occupations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As subclass 191 visa applications are not made in relation to a specific occupation, they are given lower priority, and are generally processed in the order in which they were received.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, 90 per cent of subclass 191 visas are processed within nine months, which is consistent with the processing times for other general skilled migration visa applications. The Department continues to process these applications efficiently, with the intention to further reduce the total number on-hand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It should be noted that each application is unique and is required to meet the eligibility criteria contained in Australia's migration legislation, before a visa can be granted. The time taken to process an application varies depending on a range of circumstances, such as the complexity of the application and whether additional checks and further assessment are required. Some delays in processing are experienced due to character and security checks, along with verification of an applicant's claims.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More detail regarding visa requirements, processing priorities for skilled visa applications and processing timeframes is available on the Department's website.</span>

The Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Tony Burke MP, also raised human rights concerns with members of Bangladesh's Interim Government during his visit to Bangladesh on 31 October and 1 November. Minister Burke also met representatives from Bangladesh's Hindu, Christian and Buddhist communities to hear their concerns.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Agreement requires the state government nominated to operate the respective weir and lock, maintain immediately downstream of the lock, such depth of water sufficient for the navigation of vessels drawing 1.4 metres of water unless determined otherwise by the Murray Darling Basin Authority.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Agreement further allows for dredging works upstream of the relevant weirs from time to time to support navigability. This is limited to occasions when the works have been approved in the respective work plans or during an emergency.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding petition PN0605 about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is deeply concerned that minorities in China, including Falun Gong practitioners, continue to be targeted on the basis of their beliefs. I have raised our concerns about freedom of belief directly with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, most recently in March this year. Representatives of my office and my department met Falun Gong community members in March to discuss human rights concerns and the detention of family members.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are aware of the statement by twelve UN experts of 14 June 2021 on allegations of 'organ harvesting' targeting minorities in detention, including Falun Gong practitioners. The Government has expressed concern to China regarding allegations of organ trafficking on a number of occasions. The Australian Government will continue to examine closely allegations of organ trafficking in China and, as appropriate, raise the issue with China.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to preventing organ trafficking more broadly and will continue to monitor transplantation practices of other countries and regularly review available evidence as new reports are published.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 4 November 2024 regarding a petition (PN0623) requesting Australia Post to retain the Spit Junction Post Office in Mosman, New South Wales. I apologise for the delay in responding but wanted to ensure this response provided relevant information to assist you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns raised in the petition about the closure of the Post Office and the impact this may have on residents, in particular the elderly and people with limited mobility being able to access postal and other services in the area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post is required to perform its functions consistent with sound commercial practice and meet a range of performance standards outlined in the Australian Postal Corporation (Performance Standards) Regulations 2019. Under the Performance Standards Regulations, Australia Post is required to maintain 4,000 post offices, including 2,500 in non-metropolitan locations. As at 30 June 2024, Australia Post maintained 4,198 retail outlets, which exceeded the regulatory requirement of 4,000.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has not reduced the minimum number of post offices that Australia Post must maintain. Post Office closures within regulatory requirements are a decision for Australia Post, and the Government expects that any closures are operationally necessary and will be done in consultation with affected stakeholders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post's day to day operations are the responsibility of its board and management. By law, it is legally and financially separate from the Government and does not receive financial support from the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post has advised that the Spit Junction Post Office experienced significant financial losses, driven by a continued decline in customers, making it financially unviable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The community can access postal services at the nearby Mosman Post Office which is less than one kilometre away and there are 10 alternative outlets within five kilometres of the Spit Junction Post Office. In addition, Australia Post has established nearby a new self-service hub with 24/7 parcel lockers, Post Office Boxes and a vending machine selling postal products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to work with Australia Post, licensees and communities so that services meet the needs of modern Australia, consistent with existing regulatory requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 December 2023 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition EN5547, with 259 signatures, concerning Visa 309 Processing time in Amman Office. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns expressed in the petition regarding processing times for Partner visa applications assessed in the Department of Home Affairs' office in Amman. I also note that similar concerns regarding Partner visa processing times were raised in earlier Petitions presented to the Standing Committee on Petitions, albeit not specific to the Amman or other offshore visa processing offices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department aims to process all Partner visa application as quickly as is practicable. Actual processing timeframes can vary depending on a number of factors that may include, but are not limited to, the quality and completeness of applications, the applicants' responsiveness to requests for information, and the complexity involved in assessing relationship, character, health and security requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Concerning Partner visa processing at the Department's offshore offices, I can advise that the Department manages the allocation of resources to deliver the Family program in line with the planning levels and priorities set by the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2021-22, the Partner visa program has operated under a fully global processing model, allowing better distribution of the caseload across various processing locations in and outside Australia. The model ensures a greater degree of consistency in visa processing and program delivery, and allows for more agile responses to external impacts on the program, such as COVID-19 and other regional crisis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the model allows decision ready applications to be easily identified and finalised. However, complex cases will continue to require greater scrutiny and longer times to finalise, and processing times may still vary between processing locations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that applicants may be separated from their partners for extended periods while awaiting a decision on their Partner visa application. If a specific case is needing more urgent consideration, the Department has a Partner Visa Enquiry Form which applicants can access via the Department's website to request priortisation on compassionate and compelling grounds. See:</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Requests for priority consideration from Partner visa applicants are extremely common, including due to the ongoing security, political and economic instability in many areas of the Middle East region. As a result, to be considered for priority processing, the nature of circumstances presented as compassionate needs to be an exception to the daily circumstances faced by the majority of Partner applicants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing petition EN5547 to my attention. I trust the above information is useful.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5640 to make it illegal for all business to not accept cash.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands the important role cash still plays in our payments system and supports Australians having continued access to cash. Cash is an important payment method for some people, including those unable to use digital payments and those in regional areas, and plays a vital role in their inclusion in the wider economy. Cash is still accepted by up to 94 per cent of merchants as a means of payment, is used as a store of value, and supports payment system resilience during digital payment outages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 June 2023, the Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System was released. It details the Government's priorities and objectives in relation to payments and includes a commitment to continued cash access for Australians. You can find the plan at: www.treasury.gov.au/publication/p2023-404960.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 November 2024, the Government announced that it will introduce a mandate requiring businesses to accept cash when selling essential items, with appropriate exemptions for small businesses. Mandating cash for essential purchases, such as groceries and fuel, means those who rely on cash will not be left behind.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="&#xA;        margin-bottom:0pt;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 December 2024, a consultation paper was issued to seek feedback on which businesses supplying essential goods and services should be covered by the mandate. The consultation will consider the needs of those who rely on cash, including people in regional areas and those unable to use digital payments. It will also consider whether further steps are required to ensure the long-term and sustainable distribution of cash to enable adequate access. The paper is available at:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The final details of the mandate will be announced in 2025, and subject to outcomes from consultation, the mandate would commence from 1 January 2026.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 26 February 2024 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition EN5750, with 105 signatures, concerning long processing times for offshore Partner visa. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns expressed in the petition regarding processing times for Partner visa applications assessed in the Department of Home Affairs' office in Amman. I also note that similar concerns regarding Partner visa processing times were raised in an earlier Petition, 'Visa 309 Processing time in Amman Office (EN5547)'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department aims to process all Partner visa applications as quickly as is practicable. Actual processing timeframes can vary depending on a number of factors that may include, but are not limited to, the quality and completeness of applications, the applicants' responsiveness to requests for information, and the complexity involved in assessing relationship, character, health and security requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Concerning Partner visa processing at the Department's offshore offices, I can advise that the Department manages the allocation of resources to deliver the Family program in line with the planning levels and priorities set by the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2021-22, the Partner visa program has operated under a fully global processing model, allowing better distribution of the caseload across various processing locations in and outside Australia. The model ensures a greater degree of consistency in visa processing and program delivery, and allows for more agile responses to external impacts on the program, such as COVID-19 and regional crisis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the model allows decision ready applications to be easily identified and finalised. However, complex cases will continue to require greater scrutiny and longer times to finalise, and processing times may still vary between processing locations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="&#xA;        margin-bottom:0pt;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that applicants may be separated from their partners for extended periods while awaiting a decision on their Partner visa application. If a specific case is needing more urgent consideration, the Department has a Partner Visa Enquiry Form which applicants can access via the Department's website to request prioritisation on compassionate and compelling grounds at: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/departmental-forms/online-forms/partner-processing-enquiry-form.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Requests for priority consideration from Partner visa applicants are extremely common, including due to the ongoing security, political and economic instability in many areas of the Middle East region. As a result, to be considered for priority processing, the nature of circumstances presented as compassionate needs to be an exception to the daily circumstances faced by the majority of Partner applicants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN5750 to my attention. I trust the above information is useful.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5960.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands the important role cash still plays in our payments system and supports Australians having continued access to cash. Cash is an important payment method for some people, including those unable to use digital payments and those in regional areas, and plays a vital role in their inclusion in the wider economy. Cash is still accepted by up to 94 per cent of merchants as a means of payment, is used as a store of value, and supports payment system resilience during digital payment outages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 June 2023, the Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System was released. It details the Government's priorities and objectives in relation to payments and includes a commitment to continued cash access for Australians. You can find the plan at: www.treasury.gov.au/publication/p2023-404960.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 November 2024, the Government announced that it will introduce a mandate requiring businesses to accept cash when selling essential items, with appropriate exemptions for small businesses. Mandating cash for essential purchases, such as groceries and fuel, means those who rely on cash will not be left behind.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 December 2024, a consultation paper was issued to seek feedback on which businesses supplying essential goods and services should be covered by the mandate. The consultation will consider the needs of those who rely on cash, including people in regional areas and those unable to use digital payments. It will also consider whether further steps are required to ensure the long-term and sustainable distribution of cash to enable adequate access. The paper is available at:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 June 2024 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition EN6116, with 59 signatures, concerning prioritising onshore Employer Nomination Scheme (subclass 186), Temporary Residence Transition stream applicants.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 June 2024 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP enclosing Petition EN6198, with 21,298 signatures, concerning the reduction of the maximum eligible age in the Temporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa (TGV). Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Migration Strategy, released on 11 December 2023, outlined the Australian Government's vision for getting migration working for the nation and building a migration system that delivers for workers, businesses and all Australians. It outlined a suite of broader structural reforms aimed to ensure that our most highly skilled international graduates drive long term prosperity by transitioning to permanent visas as soon as possible. Key objectives of the Migration Strategy are to build stronger communities and reduce migrant worker exploitation by reducing the number of migrants who are permanently temporary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lowering the age eligibility from 50 to 35 years or under for the TGV supports the wider objective of reducing 'permanent temporariness' and repositions the visa as a visa for early career professionals to gain valuable work experience. This change applied from 1 July 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to advise that the postgraduate research sector was excluded from the age eligibility reforms, meaning that Masters by Research and PhD graduates can continue to apply for a TGV if they are under 50 years of age. This concession recognises the contribution these graduates make to Australia's research and innovation capabilities and the Australian workforce. The Government is not currently considering reducing eligibility requirements for other university graduates given the alternate visa pathways available.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 August 2024 regarding petition number EN6288 concerning arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), expelling the Israeli Ambassador and ceasing all export permits for weapons to Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to explain how Australia has been contributing to global efforts to end this war.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many Australians are understandably traumatised by the past year in the Middle East. Every day we see more unbearable scenes. The terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023: the worst loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust, and almost 100 hostages still held. And in Israel's response: 46,000 Palestinians killed—including more than 13,000 children. Almost two million Palestinians facing starvation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While this conflict might be far away, it has been close to many in Australia. Some have lost family—or have loved ones in danger. On our own, Australia has few ways to move the dial in the Middle East. That's why we have been so focused on partnering with other countries that also want to end this war, deliver lifesaving aid, and uphold international law. It's only by being active in the international community that we can build momentum for peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia welcomes the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage agreement in Gaza after 15 months of conflict and a devastating loss of civilian life. Australia has consistently been part of the international call for a ceasefire and release of hostages. It is more than a year since Australia voted for a ceasefire with 152 other countries at the United Nations General Assembly. As the conflict spread to Lebanon, we called for a ceasefire alongside dozens of others including the European Union and regional leaders Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As well as our co-ordinated calls for ceasefire and the release of hostages, we act in concert with other donors to provide lifesaving aid. Australia has committed more than $90 million in humanitarian assistance to support civilians impacted by conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. We have also doubled our annual funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia works with Canada, New Zealand and other supporters of international law, including by backing the independence of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the ICC. The Netanyahu Government must comply with the ICJ's binding orders, including enabling the provision of basic services and enabling humanitarian assistance at scale. Concerning the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants, the Government has been clear that Australia will consistently with its obligations under international law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International law includes the UN Charter that allows countries to defend themselves—and the Geneva Conventions that protect civilians during wars. Palestinian civilians cannot pay the price of defeating Hamas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In pressing for change, we consider the full range of tools we have available—diplomacy and dialogue, working in coalitions, multilateral forums, legislation, public statements. Sanctions are not our only choice in sending other countries a message, and they are rarely our first choice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When Australia does apply sanctions, we co-ordinate with partners. That's what makes them effective. We joined a large number of countries in condemning and sanctioning Hamas, Hizballah and others for their terrorism. Just as we have partnered in sanctioning Israeli extremist settlers for their violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia maintains diplomatic relations with many countries because it is in our national interests to do so, even where we do not agree with everything those countries do. More than 160 countries maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, and we have been using our diplomatic ties to press Israel to adhere to international law, to coordinate consular assistance for Australians and their families wanting to leave Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding Australians serving with the IDF, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not track the movements of Australians overseas. Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995</span>, it is an offence for Australians to engage in hostile activities overseas, unless serving in or with the armed forces of a foreign country. This legislation discourages Australians from fighting in overseas conflicts and endangering their lives and the lives of others. The Government encourages all Australians who seek to serve with the armed forces of a foreign country to carefully consider their legal obligations, and ensure their conduct does not constitute a criminal offence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All-or-nothing demands do nothing to end the Middle East cycle of violence. That can only happen when the promise of two states is fulfilled—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Right now, this seems a distant prospect. It is bitterly opposed by Hamas, who seek to end the Jewish state. It is also not supported by many in the Netanyahu Government. But Palestinians have a right to self-determination, and Israel's own long-term security requires a two-state solution. We will continue working with the international community to press toward this goal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May 2024, Australia was one of 143 countries to vote in support of Palestinian aspirations for full membership of the UN -where I also called for a timeline for the international declaration of Palestinian statehood. No previous Australian government has taken these steps.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand Australians have wanted their government to make this war end. But this isn't Vietnam or Iraq—Australia is not contributing to the war. Nor have we supplied weapons for it. There is a big difference between Australia wanting to end this war—and being able to do it on our own.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ceasefire and hostage agreement is a constructive step towards peace and stability in the region. It must mark the beginning of a new chapter for the Israeli and Palestinian people. We are urging all parties to respect its terms and safeguard a lasting peace, including ensuring the immediate release of all hostages and unimpeded and sustained increases in humanitarian assistance to all parts of Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will continue working with the international community towards a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN6504 on alcohol excise tax. I note the petitioner's comments on alcohol taxation, and his specific suggestion to freeze the rate of excise.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Biannual indexation in accordance with the Consumer Price Index is a longstanding feature of the alcohol tax system. It ensures that alcohol excise amounts keep pace with inflation and that the tax component of alcoholic beverages remains broadly stable as a proportion of their total price. Without biannual indexation, the real value of alcohol excise would fall over time as alcohol prices rise in line with inflation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with the Australian Government's National Drug Strategy for 2017-2026, excise is imposed on alcohol to help address the social and economic costs associated with excessive alcohol consumption. Revenue from excise, including alcohol excise, goes to fund essential services of benefit to the whole community, such as health and education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continually monitors the adequacy of all tax settings, current settings balance a variety of policy objectives such as health, industry support, control of illicit goods, consumer choice, and collecting revenue for essential services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 November 2024 regarding petition EN6567 on equal opportunities and pay for women and men in sport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to gender equity in Australia. Important steps towards this goal include giving women and girls equal opportunities to participate in sport at all levels of competition and making sure that elite female athletes receive fair pay and recognition for their achievements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there are no plans to introduce laws requiring equal pay or prize money for female athletes, the Government is committed to improving outcomes and opportunities available for women and girls. For example, the Government is providing $200 million over three years through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Play Our Way</span> program for local facilities and initiatives that break down the participation barriers faced by women and girls in their communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also setting a good example for the sport sector by directly funding elite athletes in a fair and equitable way. The Australian Sports Commission's (ASC) direct athlete support scheme provides funding equally to women and men in Olympic, Paralympic and Commonwealth Games sports. The ASC is also leading other initiatives, including the Women Leaders in Sport program, to empower women in sport and foster cultures within sporting organisations which value and promote gender equity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government works closely with sports, individual sporting organisations are responsible for the salaries and prize money for their athletes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to see some things are improving for women's sport. Increased media coverage and sponsorship of women's sport in recent years is helping to generate more revenue and higher pay for female athletes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's joint hosting of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup was a great success. FIFA, the world governing body for football, significantly increased the prize money for the tournament and has plans for equal payments for the 2026 Men's and 2027 Women's World Cups. The Matildas now enjoy incredible community support and the momentum surrounding the team is giving women's sport in general a huge boost in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In September 2024, I announced the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Gender Equity in Sport Governance Policy</span> to increase the number of women in governance and leadership roles across sport. The national policy is the first of its kind in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's commitment to improving gender equity is not only limited to sport. In 2023, Parliament passed the Closing the Gender Pay Gap Bill, which among other things, requires private sector employers to publicly share their gender pay gap data. This is an important step towards seeing employer action to close the gender pay gap.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing these matters to my attention. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding EN6585 pertaining to requests for the Australian Government to sanction the State of Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to explain how Australia has been contributing to global efforts to end this war.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many Australians are understandably traumatised by the past year in the Middle East. Every day we see more unbearable scenes. The terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023: the worst loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust, and almost 100 hostages still held. And in Israel's response: 46,000 Palestinians killed—including more than 13,000 children. Almost two million Palestinians facing starvation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While this conflict might be far away, it has been close to many in Australia. Some have lost family—or have loved ones in danger. On our own, Australia has few ways to move the dial in the Middle East. That's why we have been so focused on partnering with other countries that also want to end this war, deliver lifesaving aid, and uphold international law. It's only by being active in the international community that we can build momentum for peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia welcomes the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage agreement in Gaza after 15 months of conflict and a devastating loss of civilian life. Australia has consistently been part of the international call for a ceasefire and release of hostages. It is more than a year since Australia voted for a ceasefire with 152 other countries at the United Nations General Assembly. As the conflict spread to Lebanon, we called for a ceasefire alongside dozens of others including the European Union and regional leaders Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As well as our co-ordinated calls for ceasefire and the release of hostages, we act in concert with other donors to provide lifesaving aid. Australia has committed more than $90 million in humanitarian assistance to support civilians impacted by conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. We have also doubled our annual funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia works with Canada, New Zealand and other supporters of international law, including by backing the independence of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. International law includes the UN Charter that allows countries to defend themselves—and the Geneva Conventions that protect civilians during wars. Palestinian civilians cannot pay the price of defeating Hamas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In pressing for change, we consider the full range of tools we have available—diplomacy and dialogue, working in coalitions, multilateral forums, legislation, public statements. Sanctions are not our only choice in sending other countries a message, and they are rarely our first choice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When Australia does apply sanctions, we co-ordinate with partners. That's what makes them effective. We joined a large number of countries in condemning and sanctioning Hamas, Hizballah and others for their terrorism. Just as we have partnered in sanctioning Israeli extremist settlers for their violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All-or-nothing demands do nothing to end the Middle East cycle of violence. That can only happen when the promise of two states is fulfilled—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Right now, this seems a distant prospect. It is bitterly opposed by Hamas, who seek to end the Jewish state. It is also not supported by many in the Netanyahu Government. But Palestinians have a right to self-determination, and Israel's own long-term security requires a two-state solution. We will continue working with the international community to press toward this goal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May 2024, Australia was one of 143 countries to vote in support of Palestinian aspirations for full membership of the UN—where I also called for a timeline for the international declaration of Palestinian statehood. No previous Australian government has taken these steps.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand Australians have wanted their government to make this war end. But this isn't Vietnam or Iraq—Australia is not contributing to the war. Nor have we supplied weapons for it. There is a big difference between Australia wanting to end this war—and being able to do it on our own.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ceasefire and hostage agreement is a constructive step towards peace and stability in the region. It must mark the beginning of a new chapter for the Israeli and Palestinian people. We are urging all parties to respect its terms and safeguard a lasting peace, including ensuring the immediate release of all hostages and unimpeded and sustained increases in humanitarian assistance to all parts of Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will continue working with the international community towards a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN6638 regarding an urgent federal review of strata management practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the concerns raised by petitioners in response to recent investigative reports into the strata industry. The Government is committed to ensuring strong protections for Australian consumers, including strata residents, and we appreciate suggestions to inform consideration of these matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, states and territories have primary policy responsibility for the regulation of strata schemes, including through state or territory-specific laws providing for the establishment, governance and regulation of strata schemes and strata managers. In some cases, these laws include restrictions and requirements relating to strata management arrangements, and specifically remove the application of certain Commonwealth regulation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The matters raised in the investigative reports referenced by the petition largely relate to the conduct of strata managers, and the potential that some strata manager behaviour may be in breach of state and territory regulations, in violation of duties owed to owners' corporations as their delegate agent. The Government therefore considers states and territories are better placed to investigate the matters raised, to determine whether regulatory reform is necessary.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be interested to note Commonwealth, state and territory Consumers Ministers considered consumer issues in the strata sector at the Consumer Ministers Network meeting on 10 December 2024.

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Middle East</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding EN6653 on the conflict in the Middle East.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to explain how Australia has been contributing to global efforts to end this war.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many Australians are understandably traumatised by the past year in the Middle East. Every day we see more unbearable scenes. The terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023: the worst loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust, and almost 100 hostages still held. And in Israel's response: 46,000 Palestinians killed—including more than 13,000 children. Almost two million Palestinians facing starvation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While this conflict might be far away, it has been close to many in Australia. Some have lost family- or have loved ones in danger. On our own, Australia has few ways to move the dial in the Middle East. That's why we have been so focused on partnering with other countries that also want to end this war, deliver lifesaving aid, and uphold international law. It's only by being active in the international community that we can build momentum for peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia welcomes the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage agreement in Gaza after 15 months of conflict and a devastating loss of civilian life. Australia has consistently been part of the international call for a ceasefire and release of hostages. It is more than a year since Australia voted for a ceasefire with 152 other countries at the United Nations General Assembly. As the conflict spread to Lebanon, we called for a ceasefire alongside dozens of others including the European Union and regional leaders Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As well as our co-ordinated calls for ceasefire and the release of hostages, we act in concert with other donors to provide lifesaving aid. Australia has committed more than $90 million in humanitarian assistance to support civilians impacted by conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. We have also doubled our annual funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia works with Canada, New Zealand and other supporters of international law, including by backing the independence of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. We are clear that the Netanyahu Government must comply with their binding orders, including enabling the provision of basic services and enabling humanitarian assistance at scale. International law includes the UN Charter that allows countries to defend themselves—and the Geneva Conventions that protect civilians during wars. Palestinian civilians cannot pay the price of defeating Hamas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has joined a large number of countries in condemning and sanctioning Hamas, Hizballah and others for their terrorism. Just as we have partnered in sanctioning Israeli extremist settlers for their violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All-or-nothing demands do nothing to end the Middle East cycle of violence. That can only happen when the promise of two states is fulfilled—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Right now, this seems a distant prospect. It is bitterly opposed by Hamas, who seek to end the Jewish state. It is also not supported by many in the Netanyahu Government. But Palestinians have a right to self-determination, and Israel's own long-term security requires a two-state solution. We will continue working with the international community to press toward this goal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May 2024, Australia was one of 143 countries to vote in support of Palestinian aspirations for full membership of the UN—where I also called for a timeline for the international declaration of Palestinian statehood. No previous Australian government has taken these steps.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand Australians have wanted their government to make this war end. But this isn't Vietnam or Iraq -Australia is not contributing to the war. Nor have we supplied weapons for it. There is a big difference between Australia wanting to end this war—and being able to do it on our own.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ceasefire and hostage agreement is a constructive step towards peace and stability in the region. It must mark the beginning of a new chapter for the Israeli and Palestinian people. We are urging all parties to respect its terms and safeguard a lasting peace, including ensuring the immediate release of all hostages and unimpeded and sustained increases in humanitarian assistance to all parts of Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will continue working with the international community towards a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 November 2024 regarding Petition EN6670 on the release the sealed chapter of the report of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 November 2023 the Australian Government released its response to the report of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme, accepting, or accepting in principle, all 56 recommendations made by the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission's findings align with the priorities and reforms the Australian Government took to the Australian people at the last election—building trust in government, investing in a capable public sector, delivering strong institutions and ensuring humans are put back at the centre of human services and service delivery. The Government remains committed to implementing the Royal Commission's recommendations, involving efforts from across the public service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 30 October 2024 the Inspector of the National Anti-Corruption Commission (the Inspector) published the Report of their investigation into the National Anti-Corruption Commission's (Commission) decision not to investigate refe1rnls from the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme. The Inspector recommended that the decision not to investigate the referrals be reconsidered by an appropriate person. This recommendation was accepted by the Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By design, the Commission is subject to robust and independent oversight, including through the establishment of the Inspector. The release of the Inspector's report demonstrates that oversight is functioning as the Parliament intended.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 November 2024 I issued a statement indicating that the Government proposes to publish the confidential chapter at the first appropriate opportunity. The statement indicates that the Government had planned to table the confidential chapter in the House of Representatives in the Parliamentary sitting week of 4 to 8 November 2024, but is now considering the appropriate timing following release of the report of the Inspector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 December 2024 the Commission announced the appointment of the Hon Geoffrey Nettle AC KC, former Justice of the High Court of Australia, as the independent delegate who will reconsider the referrals made to the Commission by the Royal Commission. The Government has sought advice from Mr Nettle on the question of tabling the confidential chapter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Medicinal Cannabis</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 November 2024 regarding petition number PN0624 on medicinal cannabis cost issues and access through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for everyone that needs it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware many Australians are experiencing difficulties with the cost of medicinal cannabis, and that patients are reporting benefits since commencing treatment with the medicine. I acknowledge the challenges of each patient's experience and would like to thank you for sharing the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government enables access to affordable medicines by listing medicines on the PBS that have been recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The PBAC is an independent and expert body, comprising doctors, health professionals, health economists and consumer representatives. Under legislation, the Government can only list a medicine on the PBS when the PBAC recommends doing so. Similarly, the Government relies on the advice of the PBAC before changing an existing PBS listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When the PBAC evaluates applications for PBS subsidy, it is legally required to consider effectiveness and cost of the medicine, compared to alternative treatments. There is no legal provision for subsidised supply of a non-PBS-listed medicine, or for a PBS-listed medicine outside the terms of its listing (or specific restrictions). No exceptions are permitted for individual patients, even in particular cases where the medicine might be beneficial or recommended on clinical grounds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicinal cannabis products are regulated medicines in Australia. Medicines are not generally made available on the PBS to treat conditions for which they have not been approved for use in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). This is important because the PBS listing process relies.in part on the assessment of quality, safety and efficacy that serves as the basis for TGA registration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA provides safe and legal access to medicinal cannabis in appropriate circumstances. Epidyolex(R) (cannabidiol) is registered by the TGA for seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome and is PBS listed for these indications. Sativex(R) (nabiximols) is registered by the TGA for moderate to severe multiple sclerosis but is currently not listed on the PBS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sativex was considered by PBAC for PBS listing in 2013 and again in March 2020. The PBAC did not recommend listing at those times, due to limited evidence to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety compared with standard treatment. Other than Sativex and Epidyolex, all other medicinal cannabis products are considered 'unapproved,' meaning they have not been evaluated by the TGA for safety, quality and efficacy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA encourages the use of medicines which have been approved in Australia and included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). However, for various reasons, there are times when approved and available products may not meet the needs of all patients and clinical situations. In recognition of this, there are provisions that allow doctors and patients to access 'unapproved' treatments such as medicinal cannabis. These provisions include the Special Access Scheme (SAS) and Authorised Prescriber (AP) scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals are encouraged to speak to their treating doctor about the appropriateness of seeking access to 'unapproved' medicinal cannabis products for their individual circumstances. It is expected that the prescribing health practitioner will have considered all appropriate treatment options included on the ARTG and available in Australia, prior to considering accessing an unapproved good under the SAS or AP scheme for their patient(s).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has no control over the price a supplier charges for 'unapproved' medicines. In some circumstances, a pharmaceutical company may be willing to supply its product at a reduced cost through a 'compassionate access' program. Decisions to grant access to such programs is one made by the company alone, and not by the Government. Individuals or their prescribing health practitioner may wish to contact the relevant company to enquire about the availability of such access programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, private health insurance subsidy of medicines is a matter for insurance companies. Some private health insurance providers may cover the cost of medicinal cannabis products. Individuals can contact their relevant health insurance provider for further information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All aspects of patient care, including recommendations about appropriate treatments and interpretation of PBS eligibility and access, are the responsibility of the patient's treating doctor. I encourage patients to discuss information in this letter with their treating doctor.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 November 2024 regarding Petition PN0626 requesting the Government to ensure all chocolate sold in Australia is free from child labour.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government considers the worst forms of child labour and other forms of modern slavery, no matter where they occur, to be abhorrent crimes that have no place in our society. Modern slavery is a serious issue and the Government is delivering on its commitment to strengthen its already comprehensive response to modern slavery at home and abroad.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is strengthening our framework towards ensuring the supply chains Australians use do not promote, condone or financially support modern slavery, including by strengthening the <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Slavery Act 2018</span> (Cth) (the Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act has increased business and government awareness of modern slavery risks, including the worst forms of child labour. The Act requires certain large businesses to report annually on how they are assessing and addressing modern slavery risks in their global supply chains and operations. These risks include those associated with the production and manufacturing of chocolate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides support and guidance to businesses to help them report in accordance with the Act. This includes information on the risks of the worst forms of child labour and other forms of modern slavery in supply chains, and the importance of due diligence in relation to addressing modern slavery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has amended the Act to implement its commitment to establish an independent Anti-Slave1y Commissioner to bolster Australia's response. On 7 November 2024, the Governor-General, Her Excellency the Honourable Ms Sam Mostyn AC, appointed Chris Evans as the inaugural Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner (the Commissioner) for a period of five years commencing 2 December 2024. The Government has committed $8 million over four years, and $2 million each year thereafter to support the Commissioner's establishment and operation. The Commissioner is a new, independent pillar of Australia's response to modern slavery and will complement existing efforts across government, business and civil society to combat these crimes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner will further strengthen work to prevent and respond to modern slavery by supporting and engaging with victims and survivors, raising community awareness and supporting entities carrying on business in Australia to address the risks of modern slavery practices in their operations and supply chains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 December 2024, the Government released its response to the report on the statutory review of the Act following careful consideration of the recommendations. The Government agreed in full, in part, or in-principle, to 25 of the 30 recommendations, in line with the Government's commitment to strengthen the Act. The response commits the Government to consulting on potential reforms, including a model for written declarations of a region, location, industry, product, supplier or supply chain that is regarded as carrying a high modern slavery risk.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government may consider ways to further strengthen Australia's response to the worst forms of child labour and other forms of modern slave1y consistent with its response to the review of the Act and in consultation with the Commissioner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  I rise to present the report of the New Zealand and Vanuatu delegation of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Joint Standing Committee on Migration Delegation: New Zealand and Vanuatu 26-31 August 2024</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report recounts the various meetings and site visits the delegation undertook while in New Zealand and Vanuatu and outlines the matters discussed at these meetings. Australia maintains extremely close and friendly relationships with both of these countries, with migration strongly underpinning and reinforcing these bilateral relationships. The delegation was honoured to have the opportunity to visit these countries to discuss a wide range of matters related to migration. To begin with, the delegation visited Wellington, New Zealand between 26 and 28 August. While in Wellington, the delegation met with a range of organisations and individuals including New Zealand's Associate Minister of Immigration, the Hon. Casey Costello; the New Zealand opposition's spokesperson for Immigration, the Hon. Phil Twyford; New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; New Zealand's education and workforce committee; Health New Zealand; Immigration New Zealand; the New Zealand Red Cross; and the Medical Council of New Zealand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These meetings provided the delegation with the chance to discuss virtually every aspect of New Zealand's migration system, as well as matters affecting New Zealanders within Australia's migration system, such as the recent changes to allow New Zealand residents in Australia a direct path to Australian citizenship. Of particular interest to the delegation in relation to New Zealand's migration system were: New Zealand's system of seasonal employment, and New Zealand's close relationship with its Pacific neighbours within this system; New Zealand's approach to attracting and retaining international healthcare workers; and New Zealand's approach to settlement services for refugees. The delegation felt that there is scope for Australia to learn from New Zealand's experience in dealing with our own seasonal worker program, our healthcare workforce shortages and our own refugee settlement services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 29 and 31 August the delegation visited Vanuatu's capital city, Port Vila. The delegation's time in Vanuatu provided an opportunity to discuss Vanuatu's participation in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme—the PALM scheme as it's known—by which thousands of Ni-Vanuatu workers have already contributed to Australia's primary industries, and which acts as an important source of remittances and up-skilling for Ni-Vanuatu people. The delegation also discussed the recently announced Pacific engagement visa, which provides up to 150 permanent visas each year for Ni-Vanuatu people wishing to live and work in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While in Vanuatu, the delegation met with individuals, such as the minister for internal affairs, the Hon. Andrew Napuat MP; Vanuatu's minister for finance, the Hon. Johanny Koanapo MP; and Vanuatu's commissioner of labour, Ms Murielle Meltenoven. The delegation also met with organisations such as V-Lab and Yumi Growem, which provide support for returned seasonal workers to start their own businesses, and with the International Organization for Migration, the IOM, which, among other things, facilitates training for seasonal workers and their families prior to departure. At V-Lab and Yumi Growem, the delegation had the opportunity to meet with former seasonal workers who had used the skills and finances accumulated through participation in the seasonal worker programs to establish small businesses. It was gratifying for the delegation to see how seasonal work in Australia can translate to small business opportunities for Ni-Vanuatu entrepreneurs and contribute to sustained economic growth for Vanuatu. The delegation also visited an IOM facilitated training session for outgoing seasonal workers and their families. The delegation was delighted to have the opportunity to speak firsthand with the seasonal workers destined for Australia to hear about their experiences and expectations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While in Vanuatu the delegation was honoured to be hosted for an evening reception at the official residence of the Australian High Commissioner to Vanuatu, His Excellency Mr Max Willis. The reception allowed the delegation to speak to Vanuatu's political leaders, including members of Vanuatu's parliament—Madame the Hon. Jenny Regenvau and the lord mayor of Port Vila, Ms Marie Louise Milne—as well as staff of Vanuatu's parliament and officials of the Australian High Commission in Vanuatu.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on behalf of the delegation, I'd like to thank the officials of the Australian High Commissions in New Zealand and Vanuatu for facilitating such a stimulating and insightful series of meetings and events, and ensuring the delegation was where it needed to be when it needed to be there. I also thank the staff of the International and Parliamentary Relations Office, here in Parliament House in Canberra, for all of their hard work in bringing this program together and for facilitating our travel, accommodation and visas. I also thank Mr Danton Leary, the inquiry secretary to the committee, and the delegation secretary, who ably supported the delegation while in country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I also thank my fellow delegates: Dr Anne Webster, the deputy leader of the delegation and the deputy chair of the committee; Mr Cameron Caldwell and Ms Casandra Fernando for their collegiality and contribution to the delegation. I commend the report to the parliament. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm introducing this bill because the community has been waiting three years for the government to enact meaningful reforms to protect whistleblowers, but so far bugger-all has been done and we're all bitterly disappointed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor talked a big game about transparency before forming government, and they point to the National Anti-Corruption Commission as evidence that the job is done. But the reality is that, until we have effective whistleblower protections, the NACC will be diminished because people won't have the confidence to raise allegations. In other words, it's way beyond time for Labor to get serious about transparency and good governance, including by enshrining media freedom laws, meaningfully and not just strategically reforming political donations, legislating truth in political advertising and, vitally, overhauling whistleblower protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where would we be if Toni Hoffman hadn't blown the whistle on Dr Patel at Bundaberg hospital? Or if Allan Kessing hadn't blown the whistle on gaps in security at Sydney airport? Where would we be if Witness K and Bernard Collaery hadn't blown the whistle on the illegal spying on the East Timor parliament building? Or if Alysha hadn't blown the whistle on the shocking criminality within the Tasmanian youth justice system? Where would we be if Chelsea Manning, with Julian Assange and Wikileaks' publication, hadn't blown the whistle on US war crimes, including revealing that grainy video of a US helicopter gunning down Iraqi civilians and Reuters journalists in Iraq?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My point is that whistleblowers make Australia a better place and we should be doing everything we can to support them. Otherwise, we won't have whistleblowers, even though they're so essential to our democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people may recall my own history as a whistleblower over the lies justifying the invasion of Iraq but also my work exposing misconduct under the protection of parliamentary privilege. For example, there was the evidence I tabled in 2017 of Crown casino tampering with poker machines and turning a blind eye to family violence and drug use and the footage of an Aldi bag stuffed with millions of dollars being laundered at the casino. Then there was the internal report provided to me by the former head of ClubsNSW's anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism unit, Troy Stolz, which found that up to 95 per cent of registered clubs in New South Wales were noncompliant with anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism laws. More recently there's the evidence I revealed in the parliament of widespread fraud within the Australian export coal industry, the thousands of documents I tabled showing misuse of funds by Hillsong Church and the dangerous and secret drug testing being conducted by the AFL. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But parliamentary privilege should be used only as a last resort because better still would be for our laws, practices and agencies to actually work. But, in my experience, they don't, which is why whistleblowers don't feel safe to speak out themselves and often come to me instead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want hard evidence that our whistleblower protection legislation doesn't work then just look at the case of Richard Boyle, the former Australian Taxation Office official who faces the prospect of life in prison for revealing information about egregious behaviour within the Australian Taxation Office, information which has been proven to be correct. I'll say that again. Richard Boyle revealed information about appalling misconduct within the ATO, information which has been found to be true, and it is he who faces prison time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there's David McBride, the former Australian Army lawyer who provided the ABC with documents containing information about Australian soldiers committing war crimes in Afghanistan, which led to the ABC's publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Afghan Files </span>in 2017. And again, despite these allegations being backed up by the horrific findings of the Brereton report, it is David McBride, the whistleblower, who was the first person to front court and indeed the first person to be convicted of any crime. David is currently serving a five years and eight months jail sentence for revealing this horrific wrongdoing. This is just baffling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, we desperately need to reform our whistleblowing laws. Clearly the Public Interest Disclosure Act<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>in particular,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>as well as the whistleblower protections in the Corporations Act, need to be completely overhauled, which is something Labor, and specifically the Attorney-General, committed to doing before forming government in 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that wouldn't be the end of it because another yawning gap is the means to facilitate whistleblowing in a practical sense by establishing a whistleblower protection authority, which is what this bill I'm introducing today would do. Such an agency is long overdue and is something the Labor Party actually promised before the 2019 election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the title suggests, this bill would establish an independent statutory authority responsible for providing information, advice, assistance, guidance and support to whistleblowers and potential whistleblowers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority would consist of a whistleblower protection commissioner, deputy commissioners, a chief executive officer and appropriately experienced and trained staff. It would be empowered to: receive and facilitate the investigation of whistleblower disclosures; assist whistleblowers and potential whistleblowers; investigate the mistreatment of whistleblowers; and undertake enforcement activities as necessary. Importantly, the authority would conduct research and policy work in relation to the efficacy of Australia's whistleblower protection laws, and would monitor, educate and advise on how to prevent detrimental actions against whistleblowers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would also establish a Whistleblower Protection Advisory Board to provide advice to the commissioner and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Whistleblower Protection Authority to appoint the commissioner, and to monitor and review the performance of the commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has been drafted in consultation with experts who specialise in whistleblower protections, and in particular I would like to thank Kieran Pender and Madeleine Howle from the Human Rights Law Centre and Professor A J Brown from Griffith University, who is also Chair of Transparency International Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My crossbench colleagues and I are ready to work collaboratively with the government and opposition to reform our country's whistleblower protection framework, and it starts today with this bill. So I urge them to get on board and support it and, in doing so, to finally demonstrate that they really do recognise whistleblowers as an essential building block of a healthy democracy and society. Whistleblowers actually are the heroes here, not the villains. In my remaining time, I'd like to invite the member for Indi to say a few words.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  I'm very proud to second this bill from the member for Clark today, who has been a champion for whistleblowers for the whole time that he has been in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whistleblowers are vital to a healthy democracy. They play a significant role in exposing serious wrongdoing by politicians, by government agencies and by corporations. And just in the last few years, whistleblowers have helped reveal the harmful and unlawful robodebt scheme, elder abuse in the aged-care sector and the PwC scandal, just to name a few. In the PwC case, confidential government information was used to help private clients avoid paying tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When whistleblowers make the hard decision—and it is a hard decision, a risky decision—to speak out about wrongdoing such as this, we, all of us, need to have their backs. But right now Australia's whistleblower protection laws are broken. Brave people who speak up about war crimes or corruption are facing criminal charges and even prison. And as the member for Clark just noted, right now, on foot, is the case with Richard Boyle. Mr Boyle helped expose the Australian Taxation Office's unethical practices of seizing money directly from taxpayers' accounts without regard for that person's circumstances, such as whether they are women escaping domestic violence or small business owners with serious health issues. It was just appalling. And for this decision, Mr Boyle is now facing prosecution and potentially jail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The courts—this is the bit that is amazing—have accepted that 'Mr Boyle is a whistleblower as the term is commonly understood', and yet our whistleblower protection laws are so flimsy that he has no protection. This is why we so desperately need the promise fulfilled by this Albanese government to establish a whistleblower protection authority to help future people come forward. Right now there are everyday Australians out there potentially wanting to blow the whistle, and we need them to, but they take a grave risk in doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A whistleblower protection authority will support and protect whistleblowers and potential whistleblowers by being that much needed one-step shop. Furthermore, as the member for Clark has said, a whistleblower protection authority would assist us in the prevention of corruption in the first place. We need it and we need it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need comprehensive whistleblower protection reform. In 2019, Labor promised to establish a whistleblower protection authority. The clock has been ticking for three years. We're rapidly facing an election and it's nowhere to be seen. We need the crossbench to push on this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While an election hasn't yet been called, already the Prime Minister and the opposition leader are out on the campaign trail promising billions of dollars on infrastructure and other projects around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They want you to be grateful for their generosity—but they keep on forgetting that this is our money they're spending, and we just aren't getting value for money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what worries my electorate of Wentworth. We are still battling to overcome inflationary pressures in our economy. Building costs have seen some of the worst areas of inflation—with costs up 30 per cent since the pandemic. Infrastructure Australia warned back in 2019 that public sector infrastructure needed to slow down to avoid inflationary pressures both in public and private construction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But instead, they both kept spending, to the point that our infrastructure pipeline has $32 billion worth of cost pressures off a $120 billion base—that is costs that weren't anticipated in the initial project memorandums but have blown out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might forgive them if these were truly the most important projects for the country—the ones that were truly nation building, the ones that would transform the lives of ordinary Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we don't have that guarantee—as the sports rorts and the continually-blowing-out Suburban Rail Loop show, too often these projects just don't stack up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decisions are political, not for the country. The business cases are too often hidden. The budgets are too often blown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not value for money. This is not accountable spending. This is not integrity. This needs to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is where this bill comes in. And it should just be the start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very simple bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will ensure better value for taxpayers on large and expensive infrastructure projects and ensure that these projects are selected for the national interest, not political gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does this through four simple ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it requires government to put in place a long-term land transport infrastructure strategy, over a 10-year period. We may have elections every three years but the infrastructure decisions that are critical to this country must not blow with every political wind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it requires the government to make public at the time of announcement all business cases above a threshold, to allow the public to scrutinise every investment decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, it requires the minister to come back to parliament when there are material changes to the costs of a project—and, sadly, the numbers only ever go up, never down—and outline any mitigation strategies, so the ministers are accountable for these blowouts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And finally, the bill requires the government to complete and publish an independent post-completion review of all projects above a threshold. This will ensure we actually learn from past cost blowouts, and don't consistently underbudget projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures sound simple—and that is because they are. I spent most of my life before politics in business, and the sort of discipline I'm outlining is par for the course. It's pretty much the basics, in the real world and the business world out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But not in the world in here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people would ask me, 'Surely this already happens?' But the truth is it doesn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Halton review—a 2023 review that this government recommended—found significant issues with how projects were determined, and determined that there were serious doubts on the federal government's capability to be an informed investor in national transport infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review of the infrastructure investment pipeline identified 80 projects that shouldn't go ahead—but the government hasn't told us what those 80 are, so we don't know what's been cancelled and if those are the projects that should be cancelled based on that analysis. That's not transparent, that's not accountable, and it's not good value for taxpayer money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country's finances are in a structural deficit. Inflation is still higher than it should be and is hurting Australian families. We in this House need to be pulling back on spending wherever we can to relieve inflationary pressures and to deliver value for money to this country and ensure that we don't just build up more debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That should be the job of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am writing to the government and opposition leaders to commit to this bill and these changes, and I challenge them to explain to the Australian people why they aren't in the interests of this country. Certainly, from the government side, it shouldn't be so hard because some of these measures are actually based on what the Prime Minister was seeking himself when he was the shadow minister for infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this needs to be the start of a broader approach. We need to systematically look at spending across the board to work out where we can redirect. Where do we have to reduce it to get better value for money elsewhere? The crossbench has consistently argued for integrity in government spending to end the rorts, and this is part of that push.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often politicians show that they care about an issue by committing hundreds of millions of dollars in some big announcement. We need an approach in this parliament that shows that we care, by committing to achieve outcomes at the lowest possible cost, not with the highest possible fanfare, which is our current approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This needs to be just the start on how we get better value for taxpayers' money across this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank a couple of people in particular for this work. Stephen Burgess and Stephen Alchin have both made an incredible contribution to this bill, and I'm very grateful for their support in this.</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I rise to second the member for Wentworth's National Land Transport Act Amendment (Better Value for Taxpayers) Bill 2025, and I commend her, once again, on her constructive contribution to the 47th Parliament. Like many on the crossbench today, she is offering up rational policy that takes a long-term approach.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would put in place a range of things that I had assumed already happened. Coming from the private sector, I assumed that taxpayer money would be spent carefully on the things that make the most sense. But the reality is actually a bit depressing. No business case is needed, no blowouts have to be explained and we never check whether projects actually delivered what they were meant to deliver. As we enter pork-barrelling season, before an election, it's more important than ever for taxpayers to see that their money is being spent well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when governments want to spend our money on big projects, this bill will require them to do a few things. Firstly, they'll have to have a long-term infrastructure plan. Secondly, they'll need to publish a business case showing each project is actually worth doing. They'll need to explain the reasons if there's a cost or time blowout and also learn from each project for next time so we can get better at delivering infrastructure. These are sensible and reasonable measures and, apparently, they're also pretty radical, because neither party wants to be scrutinised when they're in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Big infrastructure projects are an opportunity to create the future we want. They can also be a useful economic management tool if they're done at the right time of the economic cycle. But, if they're done at the wrong part of the cycle, they can drive costs up. For example, at the moment, we desperately need more housing supply, but the housing sector is competing for construction workers with the $120 billion worth of large-scale infrastructure projects in the pipeline. Some of these projects should wait, but how would we prioritise the best ones? It's really hard to do without a business case. I was absolutely floored when I found out that big infrastructure projects don't have to have a business case. Governments can commit to spending hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars without proving that the project is needed, that it will deliver benefits or that it's worth doing. It's such a reasonable request to ask governments to publish a business case and, when there's a cost blowout, to explain it. And, after projects have been delivered, they should have to be evaluated. Can you believe they don't have to be? We never find out if a project achieved its goals or if we can change our assumptions in the future so that we can better estimate the costs of future projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed in this bill would rebuild public trust in government decision-making and allow us to learn from our failures and also from our successes. I commend this bill to the House, and I urge the government to bring this bill on for debate. This is something that all Australians will benefit from. Both sides of the House should be held accountable for their spending decisions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is heavily based on the groundbreaking work being done in Wales. Wales introduced the Well-being of Future Generations Act and Commissioner for Future Generations in 2015. The very first step was to develop a vision for the future of Wales, to hold a national conversation to establish what type of Wales they wanted to hand down to their children and future generations. As Sophie Howe, the former Commissioner for Future Generations in Wales, said, 'It should not be revolutionary for a country to have a shared vision for their future.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But many countries, including Australia, do not. Norway, on the other hand, does have one. It has a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund for the people of their nation to prosper into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have nearly a trillion dollars in debt. So this bill introduces a framework to change this, to make sure government and public bodies work together to ensure that they take the wellbeing of future generations of Australians into account in all their decision-making. This is not an easy reform. It will require broad cultural change, especially from our leaders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, how will my bill change things? It's based on the fundamental principle that the needs and wellbeing of the current generation should not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does four things. It creates a legislative framework that ensures that intergenerational equity and wellbeing are taken into account in government and other public decision-making. It imposes a positive duty on government and public bodies to take into account the long-term impact of their decisions. It establishes an independent statutory commissioner for future generations to make sure everything this act is trying to achieve is achieved. Lastly, it will start a national conversation on the wellbeing of future generations in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner will lead a public consultation process to include a wide diversity of voices to make Australians active co-creators in this new vision for Australia's future. Crucially, it will establish new ways of working that embed long-term considerations and focuses on prevention. It will ensure collaboration and integration of policies of different public bodies and portfolios so that the policies of one do not undermine the policies and wellbeing goals of the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want politicians to start thinking beyond their own re-election prospects. They want long-term solutions, they want vision and they want hope. We owe them that much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this moment to thank the many partners who have joined with me to make this bill possible, particularly Taylor Hawkins, who has made this process truly inclusive. I thank you so much. I would like to cede the rest of my speaking time to the member for Bass. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I second the motion. After being elected to local government back in 2009, I quickly realised just how short-term the mindset of decision-making can be: annual budget cycles, three- or four-year electoral cycles and maybe five-year strategic planning cycles—the system itself a handbrake on a longer-term vision, prioritising short-term political outcomes and expediency over future prosperity. That's been a key motivator for me in my work as a parliamentarian since being elected to this place, and the opportunity to be involved with this issue has been a highlight for me.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also particularly like to pay tribute to the amazing Taylor Hawkins, co-founder and managing director of Foundations for Tomorrow. Their mission is to equip Australian leaders to think beyond election cycles and financial quarters to make the strategic long-term investments that lay the foundations for a thriving community environment and economy for years to come. It's been exciting to work with Taylor and the team across this term of parliament to progress this agenda.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings us to the bill before us today, the Wellbeing of Future Generations Bill 2025, which is a bill 'for an act to establish a framework for embedding consideration of the wellbeing of future generations into government decision-making'. It will introduce intergenerational policymaking to Australia which considers the rights and interests of current and future generations concurrently. It seeks to do that by introducing four measures: establishing a federal legislative framework for the wellbeing of future generations, imposing a positive duty on public bodies to take into account the long-term impact of their decisions, establishing an independent statutory commissioner for future generations and requiring a national conversation on future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard, this approach is not revolutionary nor without precedent internationally, and there are many examples that we can look to. This bill represents a clear and positive direction for Australia to take to advance intergenerational fairness and to safeguard the wellbeing of future generations. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

In reality, this is often just a monthly email and it ends up going into a person's junk folder and the customer has to go and look up the data. They have to actively go looking for that information.

This is only about providing information and transparency. I would also just like to say that I think it's egregious that it was reported that the Prime Minister met to discuss the ban on gambling ads late last year with Network 10, the Seven Network, the Nine Network, the AFL and the NRL chairman and CEO. What I don't know and what hasn't been reported is whether the Prime Minister also met with the families who are experiencing gambling harm, the parents of the children who have committed suicide because of gambling. They are young adults, often men. I don't know whether the Prime Minister has met with Tim Costello or the Alliance for Gambling Reform, Financial Counselling Australia, Relationships Australia or gambling harm experts with lived experience.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Are we not going to do anything in this place in this term to address gambling advertising or do anything meaningful on the late Peta Murphy's work? She gave 20 months of her life to that report, and for what? We have done nothing in this place. The least we could do is require these gambling apps to have at the very front of every page how much a person is losing. Hopefully before many young men take their lives or families break down they can see that they need to change and access help. I would like to cede the rest of my time to the honourable member for Clark, who is seconding this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  It is my pleasure to second the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Know Your Losses Activity Statement) Bill 2025 moved by the member for Mayo. I also implore the government and the opposition to support it. What the member for Mayo basically proposes is that gamblers are kept abreast of how much they have lost. It's very straightforward. It's a modest reform. It's technically very easy to implement and, I understand, would cost very little to implement. In other words, it wouldn't be an impost on anyone. I suggest that it would also complement quite well the commendable work done by the government so far. BetStop, the exclusion arrangement, is a good reform. The ban on credit card gambling is another good reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But my praise for the government ends there, because none of what the government has done, even if it supports the member for Mayo's excellent idea, will let the government off the hook, quite frankly. It's now well over a year since the so-called Murphy report brought out its 169-page report which contained 31 recommendations. The government is still to respond to that report, and that is unforgivable. That report provides an excellent blueprint for reform. It is the most comprehensive inquiry ever done in this country, certainly by any parliament, into gambling and gambling harm. Those 31 recommendations are an excellent blueprint and they should be being rolled out right now. Instead, we will go to the election not only with almost no reform but with not even a response from the government to that report, and certainly no reform when it comes to the flagship recommendation of a complete ban on gambling advertising. I tell you why there will be no movement in that space. It's because the government and the opposition—they're peas in a pod on this one—are scared stiff of the gambling companies, are scared stiff of the media companies that profit hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from gambling advertising and are scared stiff of the major sporting codes, in particular the AFL and the NRL, who, between them, pocket tens of millions of dollars each year from the gambling companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said it elsewhere and I will say again here that this is the time for the government, with the support of the opposition, to step up and to stare down the media companies, stare down the gambling companies, stare down the AFL, stare down the NRL and, instead, govern in the public interest, because we know the single most significant reform that was proposed by Peta Murphy and her committee was a phased in complete ban on gambling advertising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will end it there. Circling back to the bill moved by the member for Mayo, it is great idea, easy to implement, won't cost much, will help members of the community, and, ultimately, will save lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over three years ago, those opposite promised Australians that life would be cheaper under Labor and, in those three years: interest rates have increased a massive 12 times; energy bills are not down by $275 but up by $1,000; living standards for Australians have collapsed by almost nine per cent; 27,000 businesses have gone insolvent, the most ever; and a family with a typical mortgage has spent an additional $50,000 on their interest payments. Under Labor's economic mismanagement, Australians have experienced the longest sustained period of inflation since the 1980s, the government has left a litany of broken promises and policy failures in their wake, and Australians are the ones paying for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take cheaper child care, for example. If I had a dollar for every time the Prime Minister said that Labor will deliver cheaper child care for Australians, I could retire today. But sadly for those Australian families, cheaper child care has become another one of Labor's broken promises. Don't just take my word for it; let's have a look at the data. According to the Department of Education's own data, childcare costs have increased by 22.3 per cent since June 2022, and, according to the ABS data, out-of-pocket costs for families have increased by 12.7 per cent since Labor's cheaper childcare policy came into effect in 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Australian families already know their childcare costs are increasing and they are not fooled. They are not fooled when the Prime Minister holds a press conference, usually using a childcare centre as a political backdrop, telling them that they are saving money. He keeps telling Australians they are saving money and that they are better off under Albanese, but the reality is they are not, and they know it. They're not mugs. The Prime Minister and his government continue to treat Australians like mugs, but they know better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I received an email from Naomi who is currently paying $16,000 a year for child care, after the childcare subsidy, for one child. That's set to increase by another $10,000 when her youngest child attends care from October. That is a lot of money—$36,000 a year for two children to attend child care. What does the Prime Minister have to say to that? There's nothing cheap about that child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the cost-of-living relief for Naomi's family and families like hers—families who are paying more at the supermarket, more at the bowser and more for their utility bills, their rents, their mortgages and their education costs; families who are working multiple jobs just to keep the lights on and food on their table? When will this Prime Minister finally admit to those families that he has failed them? He has failed you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, while we're talking about people the Prime Minister has failed—and it's a long list—I want to talk about regional Australia. I don't think the Prime Minister knows where the regions are—unless, of course, there's a photo opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year Labor announced plans to build 160 new services in regional and outer suburban areas if they win government—another promise. To regional Australians and to those groups who think that this is a fabulous idea—understandably; I get that—I want to ask you just one thing. If Labor cared so much about you—like they pretend they do right now, in the lead-up to an election—why didn't they do anything during the last three years? Don't be fooled by this shiny announcement and don't be fooled by the promise of funding for services in the regions. They've already been caught out taking money from the regions through the Community Child Care Fund, which was designed for the regions, and giving it to inner-metro seats. They cannot be trusted. Services in regional areas have been forced to close their doors because they've missed out on much-needed funding—funding that was redistributed to metro areas, including to services in the Prime Minister's own electorate of Grayndler. It was funding that was designed for regional, rural and remote communities, and Labor are already robbing those Australians to give them more inner-city votes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if you think this Building Early Education Fund will be any different, I think you'll be sorely disappointed. The only thing you're getting from the beef is a bad taste in your mouth when you realise that Labor only cares about—well, Labor. This train wreck of a government doesn't deserve three more years of your trust. You cannot trust it, because all that three more years will bring is more years of pain for Australian families.</span>

Affordable and accessible child care is not just a policy issue; it's a fundamental matter for equity and fairness. It's about ensuring that every child, no matter their background, has the opportunity to thrive, and it's about supporting families so they can balance their careers, their aspirations and their responsibilities at home. It's also about strengthening our economy, because, when you give people access to child care, they are able to participate fully in the workforce. It's great for productivity. That's why the Albanese Labor government's cheaper childcare policy is so vital.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms CLAYDON:</span>
                  </a>  The member is asking the government to deliver more access to early childhood education and care places, to support Australians to return to the workforce and as cost-of-living relief for families. Well, the good news for the member for Moncrieff is that we do have a whole lot of answers to her concerns. She need only look at Labor's cheaper childcare policies in order to understand the benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to so many families in Newcastle who have struggled to find childcare spots for their kids and who are struggling with the cost of child care. That is precisely why the Albanese Labor government is taking action and investing $1 billion to ensure that all children have access to the transformational benefits of early learning and to reduce costs for families, too. Our cheaper childcare policy is delivering cost-of-living relief to more than one million families by cutting those out-of-pocket costs. As a result, the average family is approximately $2,768 better off. This is in stark contrast to the last four years of the Liberal government, where prices went up twice as much as the OECD average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since our coming to government, there are now 1,083 new early education and childcare services, with nearly 30 per cent of those outside of the major cities. We've now got almost 42,000 more educators in the system and around 97,000 more children in early education. Today there are more than 125,000 educators in the pipeline, training up, because we're investing in TAFE as well. These figures are the result of the Albanese Labor government's investments into serious reform in the childcare and early education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is more work to do in cleaning up the mess left behind for this government by those opposite. Remember, the Liberals introduced the activity test, which families have long told me is a big barrier for so many women and families to access the childcare subsidy. As part of our reforms, Labor's going to be abolishing that activity test. We'll be introducing a three-day guarantee instead. Under Labor's three-day guarantee, more families will be guaranteed three days of that childcare subsidy. These reforms are set to cast a really wide net, benefiting thousands of women and families who were previously excluded from the subsidy. For example, child care will now be available for parents who are looking for work or are beginning their studies. They need support. They were previously excluded by the Liberals' activity test. That's why we're getting rid of it; it was bad policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to all of those reforms, Labor is delivering a really important 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood education workers. That is providing a terrific incentive needed to attract more educators to the workforce. In fact, Goodstart, the biggest employer in the country, says their job applications have increased by 35 per cent and expressions of interest are up 50 to 60 per cent. Labor is also establishing the $1 billion Building Early Education Fund, which will build and expand more centres in areas of need, including in my electorate of Newcastle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, those opposite have described our efforts to fix the childcare mess they left behind as smoke and mirrors. This is not smoke and mirrors; this is evidence based reform. I know it's an anathema for many members opposite, but that's how we work in government. Only a Labor government will deliver fairer and decent wage increases, build capacity in the system and provide cost-of-living relief for Australian families.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  It's a pleasure for me to stand here to second and support the motion brought by the honourable member for Moncrieff in relation to, particularly, the government's failure on the cost of child care. I also commend the honourable member for the work that she has done as our shadow minister in the portfolio of early child care, early childhood education and youth services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After two years and nine months of this Albanese Labor government, the cost of child care has increased by a whopping 22.3 per cent. During the last election campaign, Anthony Albanese promised cheaper child care. What have we seen instead? Yet another broken Labor promise. The data is out, and it clearly shows that this is not the case. Australians do not have cheaper child care at all. I hear this when I'm going around my electorate, whether it's doorknocking, at mobile offices or going out to the kindergartens and childcare centres. Parents and the directors of these centres tell me that child care is not cheaper. I was recently at Connect Preschool at Sutherland, for example, and parents are now pulling their children out of this preschool due to the cost. Where before they were averaging three to four days a week, now they're down to two days a week. I heard the member for Newcastle standing there spruiking cheaper child care over and over again, but the reality is completely different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do we need cheaper child care? We need cheaper child care, but we also need better quality child care. Parents need to be assured, when they are going to work, that their children are being looked after and quality education is being provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that Labor has completely failed to do in the area of early child care is to look at the preschool and kindergarten model. Instead, this is a return to the Rudd era of trying to subsidise early child care without the benefits actually reaching the hip pockets of parents. I particularly remember those failed reforms of the Rudd era because my children were at that age at the time. They were at a community preschool, and there was absolutely no assistance for the many families in my electorate that used the community preschool model. This government policy also fails to deliver for those parents. Why would the Albanese Labor Government reinvent a failed policy from Rudd? I would have thought that this government would have run as far as it could from those policies of the Rudd era, but it seems that Labor will never learn its lesson. It's all about the big headlines, but there is a total failure of policy delivery. We are seeing total failure yet again in early child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've just heard the honourable member for Newcastle and various others from Labor talk about the three-day childcare guarantee. This will totally fail, because I am hearing evidence from those in my electorate that, even with these subsidies, they cannot afford to send their kids to day care three days a week. They are having to either pull out of work to look after their children or look at other options. Having options and choices is again at the heart of the way that Labor brings out policy. The coalition introduced the activity test which gave parents some choice as to how they looked after their children before they went to school, and this is what it is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this upcoming election, if the Liberals are returned to government, we will look after families. We will reduce the cost of living. We understand what this cost-of-living crisis has done to Middle Australia particularly and to those now in my electorate who say to me, 'I can no longer afford to send my children to child care.' If we are re-elected, we will listen to the Australian people. We have listened to the Australian people, and our policies will reflect that we will bring down inflation. That will enable the RBA to look at interest rates, and we will certainly work with families to bring about cheaper, better quality child care.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  It's a real privilege to speak on this motion. I'm really pleased to hear the opposition talking about early learning and education because in government they were silent on it. They saw it as child care, and we heard barely a peep out of them, so I'm glad it's got on their radar, but let's get some facts on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that early education is a place where we can make some of the biggest inroads in development that flow through to society for decades to come. That's because the work of early educators is transformative for children and their families. We're working to build a universal early education and care system that's accessible for all families, no matter their circumstances or background. We've already taken some critical first steps, including to make early childhood education more affordable for over a million families through our cheaper child care reforms. We commissioned the ACCC and the Productivity Commission to each do a review so that we'd get guidance on how we can achieve our vision of making early education affordable and available, and what we're doing is evidence based.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've started with our policy to deliver cost-of-living relief for more than a million Australian families by cutting out-of-pocket costs, and we've seen that it's cut the cost of early learning by more than 17 per cent from when it was first introduced. An Australian family on an income of $120,000 a year, paying the average quarterly fee for 30 hours of child care a week, is approximately $2,768 better off since September 2023. This is real cost-of-living relief. It's money going back into the pockets of Australian families. By contrast, in the last four years of the previous Liberal government, childcare prices went up by twice as much as the OECD average. It was double what we've seen in other places. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more to do on cost, but we've also had to work on building up the early education and care workforce. That's crucial. The Productivity Commission stated that we had to prioritise that workforce before any major reforms, and that's why it has been a priority. Since we came to office more than a thousand new services have commenced operating, with nearly 30 per cent outside major cities, including in Macquarie. There are 41,900 more educators. There are more than 90,000 additional places. And today there are more than 125,000 educators in the pipeline we created, because that pipeline was down to a trickle. Data released by Jobs and Skills Australia just last month showed that workforce vacancy rates in the early education and care sector plummeted over the last 12 months, with internet vacancy rates down 22 per cent since December 2023. That means that there are more workers picking up jobs, that jobs are advertised for less time and that we're filling those spots. Our decision to provide a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood workers to retain and attract the workforce is an example of what is helping many centres in my community, although I acknowledge it hasn't been the simplest way forward for some. We know there's more to do. Our three-day guarantee is one more of those steps. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Liberals introduced the childcare subsidy activity test in 2018 they stated that it was designed to encourage workforce participation. Well, the effect it has had is to shut out many families, especially single parents, from access to subsidised care. As Thrive by Five's Jay Weatherill stated: 'The activity test was intended to encourage parents into work, but in fact it has done the opposite. It has limited choices and made it harder for parents, especially single parents, to make an income.' We believe that every child has the right to go to early education—whether you're the child of a single mum, an unemployed parent or someone who's studying—and we know that that helps make sure they don't start school behind. Every child in their first school classroom benefits from this investment, and our Labor government are going to make this possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another of the missing pieces is access. We especially see this in Macquarie, with the Blue Mountains and sections of the Hawkesbury both identified as childcare deserts. That puts pressure on centres in the better served areas like Emu Plains, Windsor and surrounds. Supply is a barrier to access. That's why a re-elected Albanese Labor government will establish a $1 billion Building Early Education Fund—building and expanding more centres in areas of need, including peri-urban areas like mine. And I thank every childhood educator for the work that you continue to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  I thank the member for Moncrieff for putting this motion to the House, because I relish any opportunity to speak on early childhood education and care. It is disappointing that those opposite, who in fact put this motion to the House, don't have enough speakers to speak on the topic. However, I'm happy to jump in early and speak on this very important issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how important this issue is to my electorate of Chisholm. I speak to my constituents about this issue all the time and I absolutely love visiting early education and care centres in my electorate. It was a real pleasure to bring the Prime Minister to Mount Waverley to visit the Goodstart centre there and to meet and play with the children and hear from the educators. I recently conducted a survey within my community of Chisholm around early child education and care, and I used the responses from that survey to make a submission on behalf of my community to the Productivity Commission. I've held forums and information centres with the Minister for Early Childhood Education, and I've been struck by the generosity of families in my community in sharing their experiences and acknowledging that the Albanese government recognises the transformative benefits of early childhood education and care for children and families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working to build a universal early childhood education and care system that's accessible for all families, no matter their circumstances or background. Our government has already taken some critical first steps here, including to make early childhood education more affordable for over a million families through our Cheaper Child Care reforms. We've also commissioned the ACCC and, as I mentioned earlier, the Productivity Commission to each do a review, providing guidance on how we can achieve our vision of universal early learning. We know the first five years of a child's life are incredibly important for brain development, and that's why we're investing in their future and our nation's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government also recognises that early learning educators and teachers do an incredible job, a vital job, and we absolutely value our early educators. The work they do isn't babysitting; it's early childhood education. And they make it possible for millions of other Australians to do their jobs too. Every single day, educators help our children learn and grow, and their important work should be recognised for the value it brings Australian children and their families. I want to acknowledge their work and their love and care, and I want those educators to know that, yes, of course they deserve our thanks, and they also deserve their 15 per cent wage increase for the work that they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over the weekend, my team and I were out in my community of Chisholm, knocking on doors and speaking to residents about the issues that matter to them. My team and I spoke to a number of families who are better off under our government when it comes to affordable early childhood education and care. Our Cheaper Child Care policy is delivering cost-of-living relief for more than one million Australian families by cutting out-of-pocket costs. We've cut the cost of early learning by more than 17 per cent from when it was first introduced. What this means is that an Australian family on an income of $120,000 a year, paying the average quarterly fee for 30 hours of child care per week, is approximately $2,768 better off, and that's since September 2023. We know this is real and meaningful cost-of-living relief going back into the pockets of Australian families. We compare that to what we saw when those opposite last had the honour of being in government. What we saw was that childcare prices went up twice as much as the OECD average, by a whopping 49 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're fixing this. We're making child care cheaper, and we're also working to build up the early education and care workforce, which was neglected under those opposite. Since coming to office, we have enabled over 1,000 new services, with nearly 30 per cent of those new services outside major cities. There are over 41,000 more educators, which means we're able to have more children in education services—almost 100,000 more children—with more than 90,000 additional places. I could speak for at least twice as long on our government's commitment and our reforms in this space, but I'm almost out of time. I commend our government's work to the House.</span>

Further, our cheaper medicines legislation has helped our community save $8,786,696 via approximately 1,001,792 cheaper scripts, as well as our 60-day scripts that have saved just shy of $1 million in my community from 150,000 scripts. All of these initiatives are examples of the federal Labor government building Australia's future by stronger Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an emergency department doctor and the federal member for Robertson, I could not be happier with the progress we have made so far, but there is more work to do. That is why I have launched a petition calling on the federal government to establish a second Medicare urgent care clinic in Robertson. I want to ensure that as many people as possible in our community on the Central Coast have access to a Medicare urgent care clinic. With federally funded Medicare urgent care clinics located in Lake Haven and in Umina Beach, the Central Coast desperately needs a clinic in the middle ring suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the coming weeks and months, my team and I will be taking our petition door-to-door to encourage as many people as possible to sign and support our campaign. To date, the petition has reached over 2,000 signatures and we aim to reach more. I look forward to updating the parliament on the outcome of this campaign because when it comes to strengthening Medicare, only the Australian Labor Party can be trusted to look after the health of Australians. This is in stark contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, who as health minister cut $50 billion from our public hospitals, tried to end bulk-billing by creating a GP tax and was voted the worst health minister in the history of Medicare by Australian doctors.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  It's always a pleasure for me to stand and talk about health and Medicare. My speech today is also going to focus on women's health. Since being elected nearly three years ago, I have on every occasion possible spoken about health in this place, particularly as it relates to those in my electorate and also particularly on women's health issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is about the government's legislation strengthening Medicare. I do not agree with most of the statements within the motion, despite my respect for the honourable member for Robertson. But there is one part of this that I do agree with. The free Medicare urgent care clinics are, in my view, the one area where this government, to give it credit, has improved health services. Unfortunately, though, it is just the one area, and unfortunately there are no free Medicare urgent care clinics provided in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is the western end of the Sutherland shire—the Liverpool area—and now stretches down into south-west Sydney. Despite there being a number of doctors and also that south-west Sydney has been represented by Labor members for a long time, there has been very little investment in the south-west of Sydney. I am calling upon this government to, before the election, make a commitment to a free Medicare urgent care clinic within my electorate. South-western Sydney is one of the fastest growing areas in our country, in our state and in the very large city of Sydney. It is unacceptable that this area has been so neglected on health, that this government was very choosy about the electorates in which these urgent clinics would be placed, and my electorate missed out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm now calling upon this government to ensure that, before we adjourn and go into full campaign mode, the Prime Minister—who says he cares about health and says he cares about south-west Sydney—will make that commitment to the people in my electorate. And, while the Prime Minister is there, I would ask him to make a similar commitment for women's health. I note that Labor has recently announced an extra $573 million package for women's health, and that is supported by the coalition. I'm very glad that, at last, those on the other side have discovered that there are women's health issues and that women have very different needs to those of men.</span>

                  </a>  I hear some sort of interjection on the other side, so I will back up this statement. In south-west Sydney, our nearest women's health centre is in Mittagong—hundreds of kilometres away. Mittagong is not even in Sydney; this is the Southern Highlands. So women in my electorate who need to access a pelvic pain clinic—whether it is for endometriosis, PCOS or menopause—are required to travel hundreds of kilometres. I have been petitioning the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, almost since the day I got here, requesting that one of these clinics be placed in my electorate, either in the Sutherland shire, in southern Sydney, or in south-western Sydney. To date, that has fallen on deaf ears. The minister does not appear to be terribly interested in women's health in my part of the country. It might be useful if he came out and actually saw the lack of infrastructure that's in place for women in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the coalition will do for women, if elected, is match the government's funding that was announced only today. But we will also enhance menopause care for women. We'll have a new Medicare rebate. We'll expand health professional training. We'll develop national clinical guidelines and increase funding for endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics. And it is noted that some of the good work that the other side have done on pelvic pain clinics was started under the former coalition government when we first committed to developing a nationwide strategy and framework on endometriosis. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I've said it once today, but I'm going to repeat it here in the chamber. I'm a little bit sleep deprived, so strap in, folks; anything could happen. I woke up at 2.30 this morning. I lay there until 5.30 and dropped off to sleep, and then the alarm went at six o'clock. So I am feeling not my best self. But I am not alone. There are millions of women across Australia who are in my position. Perimenopause kicked in for me at 45, and—hello!—I'm 55, and now menopause is with me every night of the week: the hot sweats, the insomnia, all the things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I couldn't be happier to be part of a government that recognises that there are thousands of women who need support through their menopause journey, and we are going to make it better and more affordable to go to a doctor. I can see the wry smile on your face, Deputy Speaker Andrews. You know exactly what I'm talking about, and so do Australian women. This is why we take health care seriously. In the last 24 hours, we have announced over $500 million to help Australian women with their health. When I'm out in my electorate of Paterson, talking to people and talking to women in their homes, health care is the No. 1 issue they raise with me. Whether they raise it for their children, for their parents or for themselves, health care is first past the post, every time. That's why I am so pleased to be part of a government that's taking health care seriously, not just for women but for all Australians. We've launched our urgent care clinics, and they are making a marked difference. When you need care that may not require you to go to a hospital but is urgent, the urgent care clinic is the place to go. You can go there with your Medicare card, not a credit card, and that is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I have been campaigning and I am now running a terrific petition with my community, who are backing it in, saying, 'We want an urgent care clinic in Paterson.' Paterson is one of the fastest-growing areas in New South Wales. We have had so many people come to live in our beautiful part of the world, but we know the health care hasn't kept up. I'm so pleased to have the member for Newcastle sat beside me today, because she has been championing the new urgent care clinic that's just opened in Charlestown, that's helping take the pressure off the John Hunter Hospital. When we get our clinic in Paterson, in Maitland, it is going to help take the pressure off the Maitland Hospital as well. These things are just so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of this is that we have been working to strengthen Medicare. We've been working to support our doctors. We've just made an enormous announcement that billions of dollars going into our hospitals. We know that our hospitals need to be better funded, so we are entirely pleased to put the money into the hospital system. We've made those announcements; it is happening. Labor gets that Australians want to be healthy from the cradle to the grave. We understand that a healthy life is the fullest life you can live, and we're prepared to fund that, unlike those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Health, he was rated one of the worst. I think he and Tony Abbott shared the crown there. So many people were just aghast at the thought of a GP tax, of cutting funding for hospitals and of making it harder to see a GP. Well, the government that you have now wants to support your health ambitions. We want people to be healthier and we are putting money into health care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I want to make is that in my seat of Paterson, since we've been in government in the last three years—I hear this: 'Are you better off?'—I know that nearly 70,000 more people have been able to be bulk-billed. It's up three per cent in my seat. Around Maitland and Port Stephens we are seeing bulk-billing on the rise, and I'm really grateful and pleased for that. We're going to keep campaigning and keep fighting for our urgent care clinic so that more people will be able to be attended to promptly. We're going to keep putting money into our hospitals, and we're going to keep supporting our doctors. We support our nurses and know that they need to be well paid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health care is the thing that people absolutely value, and so do we as a government. We're not going to let people down. We're going to continue to support them on their health journey, and they can rely on an Albanese government to put health first, second and third.</span>

Those of us on this side of the House believe in outcomes rather than spin. Labor's rhetoric about saving Medicare and celebrating anniversaries is desperate when you compare actual outcomes, because their record is actually pathetic. Not only do they keep the Department of Health and Aged Care under the thumb and are unable to provide us or the public with data on outcomes, but they manipulate departmental resources to claim bulk-billing rates are improving.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">GP bulk-billing has fallen 11 per cent under the Albanese government, to 77 per cent, while out-of-pocket costs have increased by 11 per cent—and that's just in the past year alone. To put this into perspective, the GP bulk-billing rate rose under Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, when he was the health minister, to 84 per cent, and it continued to rise under the former coalition government to 88 per cent before we left office in May 2022. But under the Albanese government Medicare is currently covering the lowest percentage of GP fees on record. On average, Australians are being forced to cover 45 per cent more of the cost from their own pocket to see a doctor than when the coalition was in government—and this is in a cost-of-living crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is happening is that people are not seeking out an appointment with their doctor, because they simply cannot afford it. This is emphasised in the regions, where we have fewer doctors to go around. The maldistribution of doctors—again, another great idea by the Albanese government!—expanded the distribution priority areas, so doctors left in a flood from Modified Monash Model regions MM3 and MM7 to MM2 and even MM1. So, in the regions, we have fewer doctors to start with, and more people are having to pull out more money from their pocket to go and see their doctor, if they can get an appointment. This is a sham by the Albanese Labor government, to brag about their outcomes in Medicare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want, however, to speak about the women's health package. The coalition supports the government's $573.3 million package announced today, which builds on the historic work undertaken by the former coalition government in supporting women's health. We will match this women's health package, including measures to enhance menopause care for women through a new Medicare rebate; expand health professional training; develop national clinical guidelines; and increase funding for endometriosis and pelvic pain. I've got to say that this was actually brought by the previous member for Boothby, Nicolle Flint, who worked incredibly hard to see that endometriosis was raised to the level where government took it seriously. I'm really pleased to see this funding announcement made, and we welcome the government's decision to expand on this work with 11 new clinics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is helping women who live with chronic health conditions like endometriosis, supporting women with menopause or helping families on their fertility journey, we are committed to getting the policy settings right. However, the coalition remains concerned that under the Albanese Labor government it has never been harder or more expensive for women in Australia to access critical primary care. As I said, the GP bulk-billing rate has collapsed. When the coalition left government, bulk-billing was at 88 per cent. It has now fallen to 77 per cent. Patients are now paying record-high out-of-pocket costs to see a doctor during Labor's cost-of-living crisis. This led to more than 1.5 million Australians avoiding seeing their GP in 2023-24 due to cost concerns. What is the outcome of that? What it means is that people live with chronic health conditions for a longer time, inevitably leading to more hospital admissions. While the Labor government wants to brag about the urgent care clinics— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  Two great things were born in 1983—Medicare and me. But don't worry; I'll stick to talking about Medicare. We're both 41, and for 41 years Medicare has been providing quality universal health care to all Australians, no matter where they live or what they earn. Medicare is something we should all be incredibly proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Medicare didn't just happen. It's something Labor has had to fight for and something we're still fighting for today. The Whitlam government first imagined it in 1971, and the Hawke government made it a reality. Ever since, Labor has stood strong to strengthen Medicare and to protect it from those who sought to tear it down. The Liberals opposed Medicare from the start, campaigning to scrap it for four elections in a row. Even when Australians overwhelmingly supported Medicare, the Liberals tried to dismantle it. Fast forward to today, and Labor is once again working to strengthen Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to government in 2022, it had never been harder or more expensive to see a doctor. Bulk-billing was in freefall after a decade of coalition cuts, including their health minister's, the Leader of the Opposition's, six-year Medicare rebate freeze. In just under three years, we have turned this around. The 2023 budget delivered a record-breaking $6.1 billion investment in Medicare, including $3½ billion to triple the bulk-billing incentive—the largest boost in Medicare's history. Bulk-billing has had an additional six million free GP visits nationwide in just 12 months, and, in New South Wales alone, 1.8 million more visits have been bulk-billed, easing the burden on families and pensioners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, it hasn't stopped there. We've also made medicines cheaper. Get this: Australians have saved over a billion dollars on prescriptions, with prices capped at $31.60 for PBS medicines and just $7.70 for pensioners. In Bennelong, families have saved $6.3 million, delivering real cost-of-living relief when it's needed most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, of course, we have our great Medicare urgent care clinics. The Top Ryde Medicare urgent care clinic has been an incredible success. It is taking pressure off our busy hospitals and providing an alternative that is free and open seven days a week, with extended hours of 8 am to 10 pm. And you don't need to just listen to me. Here is some feedback I've received directly from locals. Becky said: 'We also used the urgent care at Top Ryde on Saturday. They were fantastic. The GP on duty started my husband on the correct treatment straightaway—excellent care.' Nicky then summed it up, saying: 'I used urgent care last night at Ryde. How fantastic! I arrived at 8.45 pm and was seen by a nurse at 8.50 pm. By 9 pm I was sitting with a doctor and by 9.20 I was back at home with my care. Amazing!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what Labor governments do: we deliver services and we strengthen Medicare. These new urgent care clinics fill a gap in our health system and ensure that families get the care they need when they need it. But there's still more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locals in Lane Cove, Chatswood and surrounds have told me how important access to quality, affordable health care is to them. They also need walk-in health care outside of business hours, because getting sick does not follow a schedule. They need bulk-billed doctors without being forced to visit overcrowded emergency rooms and have lengthy delays. That's why I'm calling for a Medicare urgent care clinic to service Lane Cove, Chatswood and surrounding areas. This clinic would support local hospitals like Royal North Shore, taking pressure off emergency departments, and provide bulk-billed care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With an election around the corner, it's important to compare and contrast approaches. Whilst Labor continues to invest in Medicare, the Liberals refuse to commit to keeping or expanding our urgent care clinics. The Liberals have promised huge cuts to services, but they won't tell Australians what they'll be till after the election. Well, that's not good enough. Their record gives us a good indication, though. The Leader of the Opposition's record as health minister speaks for itself. He froze Medicare rebates for six years. He cut $200 million from emergency departments. And of course he proposed a GP tax. He voted against cheaper medicines and tried to block 60-day prescriptions. And let's not forget he cut $50 billion from public hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll always work to protect and strengthen Medicare. I'll keep working to protect bulk-billing and expand our urgent care clinic network because I believe health care is a right, not a privilege. The Leader of the Opposition, on the other hand, will do the opposite. They'll wreck Medicare.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  You know that the Labor Party are in trouble when they come into this place and start spruiking Medicare and start running the age-old trope that the coalition is anti-Medicare. They ran 'Mediscare' in the campaign of 2016 or 2019, which turned out to be absolute rubbish. We even had to introduce laws to try and prevent them from doing it again—but clearly that didn't work, because here they are again trying to do a big beat-up about Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker Andrews, I don't know about you, and I don't know about other members in this place, but the last time I went and saw a GP it cost me a significant sum of money as a co-payment—for me, and I earn good money. Those members opposite talk about strengthening Medicare, but, when they came into government, Medicare bulk-billing rates were at 88 per cent. Do you know what they are now? They are at 77 per cent. That is a big, fat fail on the part of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that upsets me the most about this government's failures isn't the fact that they were 18 months late in establishing a headspace in Caloundra, when we had promised to do it when we were in government. They were 18 months late in opening that headspace. That was a big problem for me and a big problem for young people. It took me and a concerted campaign to drag the Minister for Health and Aged Care kicking and screaming to instigate a headspace in Caloundra. But that's not the big problem that I have. The big problem I have with this government and health care—and I want to welcome members from the other place into the chamber right now—is in relation to the care of, and how we deal with, people with mental health problems and mental illness. Years ago—and thankfully those days are gone by—we stuck people with mental health problems in sanatoriums and asylums. We removed them from our sight so we didn't have to look at them. Thankfully those days are over, but the treatment and care of people who live with mental health problems in this country is nothing other than an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current health minister does not get mental health. I'm going say it again. The current health minister does not get mental health. Do you know who did get mental health? The former health minister, the former member for Flinders, Greg Hunt. He was an outstanding health minister and changed the way that we dealt with not only the funding but also the treatment of people with mental health conditions, whether they be very significant or mild.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have lived through the mental health sector personally, as a family member, both in the public sector and in the private sector. The way that this country cares for people with mental health problems is an absolute disgrace. If it were any other type of illness, people would be marching in the streets. They'd be holding demonstrations. But, because it's in relation to mental health, we don't want to talk about it. We keep pushing and shoving it under the carpet. If a person with a significant mental health illness comes up to a public hospital, they are basically put on suicide watch and released into the public a couple of days later. It is an absolute disgrace, and this health minister needs to step up.</span>

It shouldn't be easier to buy your fifth home than your first. Fourth, make seeing the GP free. We supposedly have a universal healthcare system, but have you tried to get a bulk-billing GP lately? Fifth, bring Queensland's 50c public transport fares to the rest of the country, to all Australians. Cut the cost of going to work and get cars off the road—win-win. Sixth, expand publicly owned renewable energy and tackle the climate crisis—cheap, reliable, safe renewables for all. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, we can afford all of this if we make the big corporations and billionaires pay real tax. We could, for instance, raise $514 billion over the next decade by taxing the excessive profits of big corporations. We could scrap the $368 billion we are giving massive US arms manufacturing corporations to build nuclear submarines we don't need. We could scrap the $14 billion going to fossil fuel corporations every year—every year!—in tax breaks. Big corporations and billionaires are making big bucks, while ordinary Australians struggle to pay for basic dental check-ups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's break this down a bit more. Oxfam predicts there will be at least five trillionaires by 2035. Sixty per cent of Australians have skipped seeing the dentist due to the cost. The wealth of Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart, has doubled since the pandemic. In 2022-23, there were 87,410 preventable hospitalisations due to dental issues across Australia yet 204 people became billionaires in 2024—that is, nearly four a week. Australians aged 15 and up have on average 11 decayed, filled or missing teeth, and 32 per cent have untreated decay. In 2024, Australian billionaires' wealth surged by $24 billion—that is, $67,000 an hour each or 1,300 times the average wage. Millions of Australian adults would have difficulty covering a $200 emergency dental bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting dental into Medicare would cost about $15 billion a year according to the Parliamentary Budget Office. It is not nothing, but, by taxing billionaires who are rapidly increasing their wealth, we can easily cover this. The Greens got dental cover for kids into Medicare in 2010 when we were in the balance of power. This is what is known as the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and it is hugely beneficial. Now, with a minority parliament likely, the Greens want to finish the job and get dental into Medicare for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to billionaires and their influence over politics, we have seen a preview of what can happen here over in the US—the Riviera of the Middle East, with the US taking over the entire Gaza Strip against the will of its population and the forced displacement of millions of Palestinians so that property developers can build luxury hotels in Gaza. This is what you get when billionaires take control—bald-faced, self-serving, criminal. Of course this is the kind of plan Donald Trump, a billionaire developer, would come up with. Trump's top advisor on the Middle East, Steve Witkoff—can you believe this—is also a billionaire property developer, and what does the Leader of the Opposition here in Australia call this madness? He said it is 'shrewd', 'reasonable'. He says Trump is 'a big thinker' who brings gravitas to the Middle East. This is the politics of the modern coalition under its leader—although 'modern' is clearly a misnomer—a rapacious oligarch politics that doesn't care one bit about human lives, only profits. The modern Labor Party—well, radio silence sadly from our Prime Minister. If the Liberal-National coalition is hell-bent on bringing this Trumpian politics to Australia, legitimising it, supporting it, then we need to oppose it, not stay silent. The billionaires and big corporations already have far too much power in this country, too much influence over our major parties. Instead of giving them more power, we have to fight to get them out of politics.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will also allow for regulations to prescribe how decisions are to be made and how the results of background checks are to be communicated. This includes communication of results to the applicant, to an entity who applied on the applicant's behalf, and the US Customs and Border Protection.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in the bill will also expand the scope of what background checks may be conducted under the AusCheck Act to allow an assessment of whether the applicant has been convicted of particular offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act. This amendment is necessary to align with the requirements specified by the United States government for eligibility into the Global Entry program. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A small number of Australian citizens have already been able to apply through phase 1 of Australia's participation in the Global Entry program, which commenced on 17 January 2025, and we're seeking to progress this legislative reform as quickly as possible to ensure ongoing participation in the program. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge all the Indigenous members of parliament, in particular the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, and her predecessor the member for Barton, Linda Burney.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Wednesday, it will be 60 years since the start of the Freedom Ride—a bus journey through regional New South Wales that opened our eyes wide to the discrimination against Indigenous Australians. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Led by Charles Perkins, it was a turning point in our self-awareness as a nation. It was the beginning of the possibility of something better. I note that it was controversial at the time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday, it will be 17 years since Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered the apology to the Stolen Generations—again, an event that, in some people's minds, was controversial, but one which was, indeed, a moment of unity for the nation. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a day of catharsis that held the promise of a fresh start.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both anniversaries are reminders to learn from the injustices and mistakes of the past—because that's how we grow, carefully reading the pages already written and turning to the promise of the new. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like anything made stronger by its layers, we draw strength from Australia's extraordinary and profound depths.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">No nation's story is simple, least of all Australia's. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a rich, proud and deeply remarkable story—a story of hope, achievement and survival against the odds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our stories are intertwined—but, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">gap</span> report routinely lays bare, there are still too many areas in which we are not together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest Productivity Commission reporting shows that, while we are seeing improvements on 11 of the 19 targets in the national agreement, only five are on track to be met.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is about facing up to what's not working and learning from what is. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The success stories in this report have been written by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today our government is investing in the practical partnerships that work and bringing the building blocks of a good life to people and communities that have been cut off from them for too long—from new medical facilities to safe housing, from clean water to real jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At heart, all of us hope for the same things: a healthy family, a safe home and all that it entails, an education that opens the way to a rewarding job, affordable medicines and health care, security, justice, fairness, a sense of community in which we can be a meaningful part, a stake in our economy and power over our own destinies, a power that rests in no small part on the strength of our financial circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, it's the chance to make the very most of our own lives—and to lift those around us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is no more than any Australian asks for. It is no less than every Australian deserves. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet what we in this place all know is that it remains elusive for so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no ethos more fundamentally Australian than the fair go. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closing the gap is the fairest go of all. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want First Nations people to have ownership of their futures and a stake in the economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the foundation on which everything else can be built. If we get it right, we can break the cycle that has ensnared generations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is working to enhance Indigenous Business Australia's ability to leverage its capital and investments to support First Nations communities. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will support more First Nations people to start, grow and sustain businesses, purchase homes and invest in commercial ventures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working to increase the participation rate of First Nations women in business through the mentoring and coaching program, to give them greater access to the resources, networks and support they need to launch a viable business, commercialise a viable business idea or grow an existing business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're requiring businesses which register as First Nations businesses for Commonwealth procurement to be 51 per cent Indigenous owned and controlled to improve the integrity of the program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all commonsense options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our new Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program will create 3,000 real jobs, with real training and real wages, in remote communities—proper pay and conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are jobs that make a real difference to the lives of individuals, their families and their communities, good jobs that provide a sense of pride and purpose, hope and aspiration, and jobs that can have the power to generate intergenerational opportunity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we're making it easier to develop necessary skills with the National Skills Agreement, the first in 10 years, ensuring the design and delivery of vocational education and training to First Nations people is in full and genuine partnership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also creating 1,000 new Indigenous ranger jobs across the country, a great success story that has allowed Australia to draw on the expertise of our Indigenous people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we realistically and methodically tackle the challenges of the present, we look with optimism to the future—a future in which Australia is uniquely placed to take its rightful place as a renewable energy superpower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The growing global demand for renewable energy, critical minerals and rare earths—which we have in abundance—is an unprecedented opportunity for Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the biggest change in the global economy since the industrial revolution. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I outlined at the Garma festival last year, it represents the best chance Australia has ever had to bring lasting economic growth and prosperity to remote communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New clean energy projects and processing and refining facilities can all unlock new jobs and prosperity for communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: you deserve a real stake in the economic development of the land you call home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You deserve a stake in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the principle upon which we can build a better future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Projects generating renewable energy on country should bring new economic power to communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all part of unlocking the potential of the land. Even more importantly, it's part of unlocking the potential of its people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So much of what we are doing is guided by the instinct to ensure every Australian has their best chance to fulfil their potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are dedicated to building an Australia where more families know the stability of somewhere to call home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stability that gives you the confidence to plan for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what is driving our commitment to build 2,700 new homes in remote Northern Territory communities over the next decade.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the signing of these agreements last week and the announcement on Friday in Alice Springs, it was welcomed by those communities. Welcomed as adding to a new hope and optimism for the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was good that the constructive relationship between the different levels of government was also welcomed by the mayor of Alice Springs as working with Indigenous communities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Partnering with the Aboriginal Peak Organisations NT will ensure these critical services are informed by the perspectives of Aboriginal people and strengthen the capacity of Aboriginal community controlled organisations to deliver remote services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A portion of this will be quarantined for single-carer families. This is particularly important for women who are sole carers and are often locked out of home ownership. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know we must do more, guided by common sense, focused on delivery.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To develop new approaches to solving this, we are investing over five years to establish a First Nations Economic Framework and a First Nations Economic Partnership.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We work to close the gaps by widening the powers of opportunity—and what achieves that with lasting power is, of course, education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, 2,500 First Nations young people were at boarding schools were supported by the Commonwealth's Indigenous Boarding Provider Grant. That enabled them to have that great start in life, and I thank the schools themselves who are engaged with this important program. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also announced funding to support the core operations of two education peak bodies—the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation and National Voice for Our Children. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Commonwealth Digital Connectivity pilot, wi-fi infrastructure has already been installed in 22 remote communities in partnership with NBN Co—with 23 more to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For remote communities, the internet is life-changing. It makes telehealth consultations possible. It gives young people better access to a better education, and it connects workers and businesses with new opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year will also see the establishment of a First Nations Digital Support hub and a network of digital mentors to support the digital literacy and ability of First Nations people across Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And telecommunications upgrades are also underway in more than 260 remote First Nations communities through the Remote Indigenous Telecommunication program. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also tackling issues of access to affordable food in remote communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumer advocacy organisation Choice found on average groceries cost more than double what they do in our capital cities. That is unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supplies can be erratic. The resulting food insecurity can have serious health impacts, including cardiovascular and kidney disease. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I am pleased to announce we will ensure the costs of 30 essential products in more than 76 remote stores are the same as what you'd pay in the city as well as boosting warehouse capacity to shorten freight distances and to make supply chains to remote communities less vulnerable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also build on the success of the Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation's Nutrition Workforce initiative, which trains First Nations shop staff to promote good nutrition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Australians right across the continent, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are benefitting from this government's reduction of the cost of medicines.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By ensuring reliable clean water, power supply and access to laundries, we can reduce infections that can open the door to asthma, ear conditions, trachoma, and rheumatic heart disease, a third world disease that has all but faded from living memory in most of our nation but retains its grip on Indigenous Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From measures as straightforward as additional patrols in and around Alice Springs and the use of other methods including drones, we are working with elders and leaders who want the same as any of us: to prevent crime, boost community safety, and keep their young people from harming their own futures. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his heartfelt words on a very important topic. I join him in acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet today and also acknowledge the presence in the gallery of Minister McCarthy, former minister Burney, shadow ministers Senator Nampijinpa Price and Senator Kerrynne Liddle, and other Indigenous members of parliament. I acknowledge them all as being very important contributors to this debate now and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Thursday marks the 17th anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations, but today, as a parliament, we dedicate time to reflect on the anniversary. On behalf of the coalition, I extend a warm welcome to Pat Turner and Scott Wilson from the Coalition of Peaks and thank the organisation for its work. I also acknowledge those members of the stolen generations and their families who are watching this broadcast from home, and I pay my respects to those members of the stolen generations who are no longer with us. In remembrance, we honour their memories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To understand history is to appreciate that no country has an unblemished past. But what distinguishes Australia from many other countries is that, among our overwhelming achievements as a nation, we do not shy away from our dark chapters. We have accepted those chapters, have apologised for them and continue to learn from them. The sign of a mature nation is one which embraces and tells its history in the round—its successes and shortcomings alike. By remembering historical wrongs rather than dropping them down the memory hole, we equip future generations with the knowledge that helps prevent those mistakes being made again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 1910 and 1970 thousands of Indigenous children were forcibly taken from their families under the laws and policies of successive Australian governments. The loss, the pain, the suffering and the indignity inflicted upon the children removed, the families left behind and their descendants was profound. In the 2008 national apology, Australia acknowledged this cold, confronting, uncomfortable truth, as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd put it. His sentiments were echoed by the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Brendan Nelson, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will be at our best today and every day if we pause to place ourselves in the shoes of others, imbued with the imaginative capacity to see this issue through their eyes with decency and respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The speeches delivered by Prime Minister Rudd and Opposition Leader Nelson weren't only about looking back with a heartfelt expression of regret. They were, importantly, also about looking forward with optimism and a view to betterment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Rudd saw the apology as a 'new beginning', a phrase he mentioned six times in his historic address. In one of the most important passages of his speech, Prime Minister Rudd said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are a passionate lot. We are also a very practical lot. For us, symbolism is important but, unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. It is not sentiment that makes history; it is our actions that make history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The substance Prime Minister Rudd referred to was to close the gap. The latest <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the Gap</span> annual report, provided to the coalition a few hours ago, reinforces that the current approach is not working. As the Prime Minister stated, only five of 19 socioeconomic targets are on track. Australians do want to see better outcomes. People do want to see practical solutions which make a tangible difference to the lives of disadvantaged Indigenous Australians. Australians want to see changes on the ground for those Indigenous communities where safety, housing, health, education and employment are critical issues. But, by maintaining the status quo, we will not bring about the drastic improvements we all yearn for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet there are beacons of light—clear examples of where things are working. Many of us in this place, including the Prime Minister and I, have visited Gove in East Arnhem Land. It is a success story that we should learn from. Gove's success can be replicated in other parts of the country but not all. I want to pay tribute to the late and great Yunupingu, whose leadership and social and economic initiatives empowered his people—and not just Yunupingu but those people around him in leadership positions. He established the first Indigenous owned mine in Australia. He started new businesses that also provided his people with employment opportunities—employment opportunities in a sustainable logging business, in a building business and in providing services to the community more generally. He helped found the Dhupuma Barker school. The leadership exemplified has been embodied by others in his community. Local elders have continued to attract and leverage private sector investment, which is the source of Gove's success. Industries have been built, projects have been commenced and jobs have been created—meaningful jobs—for locals. Moneys have been spent on betterment and infrastructure projects. Money has been saved to provide for future generations. Mining royalties are helping to establish a future wealth fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a 90 per cent attendance rate at the local school. Kids are engaged in the education system. They are learning both their own language and English. Wonderfully, in 2023, six students competed in the international robotics championship in Texas. The Barker school even has a space program, which will be a pathway for students to work at the Arnhem Space Centre. To be there in that classroom with those students and with those teachers is an incredibly emotional and moving experience—and to see the joy on the faces of those young Indigenous children as they were preparing to embark on the trip to the United States. That would be the trip of a lifetime for any young Australian, but in that circumstance, in that part of the world, it was a remarkable story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to looking to the strong leadership in Gove, we can also look to the strong leadership in the Northern Territory. I was with Lia Finocchiaro in Alice Springs on 29 January, along with Senators Price and Liddle as well as Lisa Siebert, a candidate for Lingiari. The Chief Minister has hit the ground running by making sure that she reflects the views of her local community and prioritises, in particular, a crackdown on the scourge of criminal activity and the unsettling nature it has for businesses and non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians who live in Alice Springs, Darwin and across the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among many effective measures, the Chief Minister has instigated a new circuit breaker program, where child protection teams conduct nightly patrols that support and free up police. If youth are found out at night or engaging in antisocial behaviours, the teams will take them home or to a safe place to sleep, and I want to thank all of those NGOs, passionate Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, that we met with recently before they were about to embark on some of those night patrols. The services that they provide are life changing, and the passion that was obvious is something we should all commend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of the Northern Territory police, as the Prime Minister pointed out before, in relation to the drone program provides an opportunity for the police to more quickly respond to a number of incidents and also domestic violence. The briefing we had from the deputy commissioner in Alice Springs was confronting in relation to the prevalence of domestic violence, and we all dedicate ourselves to making sure that women and children live in safety and in an environment that we would all expect in this place. Under the programs, the families of youth who are held to account through responsible agreements are something worth noting as a success story also, but they have a long way to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Alice Springs, I also visited a business owned by Syd Maloney, an Aboriginal man. He has owned Hardy Fencing for more than 20 years and he's recently expanded his business by acquiring Ross Engineering. Syd's workforce is 90 per cent Indigenous. We heard uplifting stories from the people he employees—people who have escaped dire circumstances, achieved financial independence and discovered a new purpose in life. One of Syd's initiatives is that he offers opportunities to young Indigenous Australians who have finished their schooling so that there's a real incentive for kids to complete their HSC. Syd's business is not just an economic multiplier in the Territory; it's also an example of what can be emulated. To hear Syd speak, including through tears as he spoke of his own experience as a child, was exhilarating, and it was a compelling story that he was telling. It was about the opportunity he was providing and the way he was able to leverage the support given to him and his business to provide a new pathway forward for a number of Indigenous young people and older people who are working in that business as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Practical changes are within reach to improve Indigenous lives. Where there's a will, there is a way, and, where there's strength, there are solutions. When we create crime-free streets, we create safe communities, and, when we have safe communities, we have kids going to school. When kids go to school, they leave equipped with the skills to earn a living, and, when people earn a living, they have resources for their health and homeownership. When there are stable homes, more families realise their aspirations. We all understand this logic. It follows that, where crime continues, aspiration is out of reach, and we will provide every support to the Chief Minister and the work that the new Territory government is doing in pursuit of that end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the opportunity here in a bipartisan spirit to do what's right and what's effective. We owe that to disadvantaged Indigenous Australians; we owe that to Australian taxpayers. We need to make sure that we can identify the excellence and identify where we can provide further support to leverage the success stories into other communities. We need to learn from the failures of the past and the present to make sure that they're not repeated into the future. There's little that we can do if safety, housing, health, education and employment are not there for Indigenous Australians, and, in too many parts of the country today, those basics are missing. We have to make sure as a national parliament we can work together in a bipartisan way to achieve better outcomes in those regards. It's something that should happen today as we commemorate the national apology anniversary. Let's bring to bear that new beginning which then prime minister Rudd spoke about so optimistically 17 years ago—a new beginning which has eluded us for far too long. I thank the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms PAYNE:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I am pleased to present this report for the inquiry into the importance of Antarctica to Australia's national interests. The committee's terms of reference focused on four key areas: upholding the principles of the Antarctic Treaty System; conserving and protecting Australia's unique biodiversity and environment; advancing global environmental and climate science; and how Antarctica is contributing to Australia's economic and social development. This report underscores the interconnectedness of these priorities and affirms Australia's enduring commitment to being a responsible steward of this extraordinary and fragile continent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has made 13 recommendations in its report. These recommendations relate to Australia's relationship with the Antarctic Treaty System, the importance of conservation and scientific research in the face of anthropogenic climate change and the important role the city of Hobart plays as Australia's Antarctic gateway. The committee recognises a strong and effective treaty system helps Australia to realise its national interests and notes the need for Australia to remain a strong leader within the Antarctic Treaty System. The committee has recommended Australia pursue the establishment of the proposed East Antarctic marine protected area, increase the number of inspections conducted of other nations' Antarctic bases and remediate the abandoned Wilkes Station.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Science and conservation are the currencies of influence in Antarctica. Therefore, it is incredibly important that Australia continues to invest in world-leading research and support Antarctic science. The committee recommends that the government provide additional support to Australian researchers working on the million-year ice core project, the Denman terrestrial campaign and the Denman marine voyage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that later this month the RSV <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span style="font-style:italic;">yina</span> will begin its Denman marine voyage. This voyage will take scientists to the Denman Glacier in the Australian Antarctic Territory for 50 days, where they will extensively study the glacier, which reaches 3.5 kilometres below sea level and which potentially contains 1.5 metres of sea level rise. The committee wishes the expeditioners all the best for this incredibly important work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While in Hobart, the committee was fortunate to board and inspect the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span>, Australia's state-of-the-art icebreaker. The RSV <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span> is the single biggest investment by a Commonwealth government in the history of Australia's Antarctic program. The vessel was built to deliver a world-leading scientific capability to conduct multidisciplinary science and to deliver personnel, cargo and equipment to and from Antarctic and subantarctic stations. Upon listening to the concerns of scientists and other stakeholders, the committee recommends that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span> be prioritised for scientific research and that resupply efforts be led by a second vessel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report makes several recommendations about the importance and maintenance of Hobart as Australia's Antarctic gateway. The committee recognises the economic and social value of Antarctica to Australia and the important role of Hobart in this. The committee has recommended that Hobart remain the base of operations for the Australian Antarctic Division and Australian Antarctic Program and that the government work to secure hosting for the Southern Ocean observing system and expedite the redevelopment of Macquarie wharf No. 6 in Hobart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's work was enriched by the generous contributions of many individuals, organisations and government departments. I extend my sincere thanks to the witnesses who participated in public hearings in Canberra and in Hobart and to those who provided written submissions. Your insights and expertise were invaluable to this inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to thank the scientists who have shared their incredible work with us. It's really inspiring work, just showing how important Antarctica is in understanding climate change and what we can do to mitigate this existential threat. Our committee is making these recommendations because we want to see our government backing you and your important work as much as we can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to thank the Australian Antarctic Division for its contribution to the inquiry, including by hosting committee members in Hobart. The opportunity to tour the division's facilities and board the RSV <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span> to gain a deeper understanding of this critical work being undertaken by the division was inspirational and informative. The dedication of division staff to advancing Australia's Antarctic program and supporting the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty system is commendable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank my fellow committee members for their engagement with and participation in this inquiry. I greatly appreciated the good faith and bipartisanship all members displayed. I particularly want to thank the committee's deputy chair, the member for Forrest, for her engagement and contribution not just on this inquiry but on all the inquiries we have worked on together this term. It's been an absolute privilege to work with the member for Forrest. I have really valued all that I have gained from that experience and all that she has contributed to the committee's work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the work of the staff of the committee secretariat. It takes a lot of work to run a parliamentary inquiry, from holding public hearings and going through submissions to drafting and, of course, wrangling members of parliament's diaries—no small task. It is a job that is often thankless but vital to the work of this parliament and our democracy. So I want to thank particularly the inquiry secretary, Samuel Thompson, and also Fran Denny, our committee secretary, whose work over the past three years has been invaluable. This is the third report our committee has handed down and their work has made each of those go incredibly well. So thank you to our wonderful secretariat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report serves as a reminder of the responsibility we bear to protect Antarctica's unique environment while continuing to advance our understanding of the profound global challenges we are presented with and support scientists to learn as much as we can from this unique continent. It is my hope that the findings and recommendations contained in this report will guide Australia's ongoing engagement with Antarctica in ways that uphold our national interest and global responsibilities. I move:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  I want to thank the chair and acknowledge her work in this inquiry and also thank all members of the committee who were part of it and showed such a great interest in and passion for what Australia is contributing in Antarctica. I also thank the secretariat, particularly Fran Denny and Sam Thompson, as the chair referred to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the really important part of this, from my point of view, was the recommendation regarding the capacity for inspections, particularly in relation to Australia's national security interest. I think that was very important in the recommendations that we made in relation to inspections and the increased interest of other nations in Antarctica and for Australia to maintain the focus on the agreements that we have in Antarctica.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased, particularly as the coalition government commissioned the RSV <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span>, to see that craft, to see its amazing capacity and capabilities, and to see the great passion that all of the staff and scientists that we met had. I think the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span> is just fantastic and is a credit to everyone involved as to not only the design but also how it will operate ahead. It brings renewed opportunity, as we will see. I think we'll see the quality of the research that will come out. We were fascinated by the krill, by the CO2 sequestration that's contained in krill, by the massive amount of krill in Antarctica and by the fact that our scientists have been able to actually have those onsite and observe them in such a fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That multidisciplinary research is so important with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span> now. I think there's huge opportunity there for Australian scientists and for the new scientists coming through. It gives them a fabulous platform to work with and from. I think it will encourage even more young people to be involved in Antarctic type research. So that's fantastic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do certainly strongly support the idea of a second resupply vessel, as this became very apparent to us. There's the need for <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span> to focus on that research capacity and for there to be also the capacity to provide the support needed. The resupply of the other bases in the vicinity was raised with us repeatedly. I think the resources on <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span> certainly should be focused on research capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the chair, I want to thank, again, all of the scientists and everyone who made time to actually contribute. I'd encourage people to read the report, particularly as to some of the concerns around national security and inspection processes. I thank everybody involved. I thank the chair extensively for the work that she put in. I hope that the recommendations will be considered very seriously by the government of the day, because they were very sound recommendations. As I said, I was particularly interested in, and I think we did a very good job on, the recommendations themselves. Earlier, I referred to recommendation 3, which is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government increase the frequency of its inspections of other Antarctic Treaty Parties' Antarctic stations over 2025-26 and beyond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I cannot stress this strongly enough:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government should consider other methods of inspection such as satellite imagery and drone use.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendments will remove schedule 2 from the bill. It strikes at the government's attack on small business, which denies deductibility for the general interest charge and the shortfall interest charge. It will also amend the government amendment on the instant asset tax write-off. Removing deductibility of ATO interest charges on schedule 2 of this bill would deny deductions for ATO interest charges: the general interest charge and shortfall interest charge. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe this is another attack on small business. We've seen some 27,000 small and medium businesses close in the last three years. This is another added burden to these businesses at a time when many of them are doing it quite tough. Small businesses at this time can least afford what the government is doing, and that is why I am moving these amendments to remove the schedule. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current arrangements, which allow for deductibility, take into account the uncertainty of the tax environment and that filed positions can be reviewed well after a tax return is lodged. The policy intent of these existing interest charges is to neutralise the loan benefit that a taxpayer gets due to the late payment of tax. The point of it is to put a taxpayer who is late paying tax in the same position as a taxpayer who has paid tax on time. But making these interest charges non-deductible goes beyond neutralising this loan benefit. It is effectively now an immediate penalty regardless of the debt levels or culpability of the late taxpayer. Denying these deductions is punitive. It risks exacerbating financial hardship for small businesses and their staff, who are already facing challenges, as I said before, such as high inflation, elevated interest rates and cash flow constraints. These businesses are facing record insolvencies, and, instead of tackling this issue, the government is hammering the small businesses again. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposed schedule 4 of the bill continues Labor's attempts to decimate the instant asset tax write-off. As I've said before, the instant asset tax write-off was previously pretty well unlimited during COVID but has now wound down to $20,000 and is not even ongoing. It should be ongoing. It should be standard business procedure for any small and family business in Australia that the instant asset tax write-off becomes permanent—100 per cent. And $20,000—I mean, you can't buy a vehicle; there are very few items you can buy with $20,000. Labor's proposal would limit the instant asset write-off to that $20,000 and not make it permanent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has consistently been slow to provide certainty on the instant asset tax write-off, and this leaves small businesses in limbo and faced with uncertainty when they invest in their business. The coalition 100 per cent supports SMEs, and we're committed to lower, simpler, fairer taxes for Australia's 2.5 million small businesses. The coalition's position, as outlined in this year's budget-in-reply, is to extend the value of the assets eligible and to make this deduction permanent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would love to lift it way higher. As far as I'm concerned it should be $150,000-plus for an instant asset tax write-off. But the additional spending of the government—some $350 billion plus on top of the last budget that Josh Frydenberg handed down—makes it difficult right now to lift it beyond $30,000. People will have to wait; hopefully a coalition government is elected very soon, under the leadership of Peter Dutton, and we will have to wait for the taxes to come in as businesses improve. As businesses get more confidence and we see more company tax come in and income taxes go up, that's when we'll be able to, at some stage in the future, hopefully lift it beyond $30,000. But, right now, $20,000 and not making it permanent is a disgrace, and it shows how little the Albanese Labor government regard small and family businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is serious about providing that lifeline, and I call on the government to support my amendment. It's not a big ask. As I said, we haven't made it $150,000, or unlimited, as it was previously; we've just lifted it from $20,000 to $30,000; it's not a big increase, and it's something the government should consider. You'd have bipartisan support to do that before the upcoming election.</span>

So, it's removing schedule 2 of the bill in relation to striking out the general interest charge and the shortfall interest charge. Obviously we want small and medium businesses to pay, but they can receive that additional interest as tax deductions at the moment. The government is taking all that away, and we're saying that at this time, when there is high inflation, when 27,000 businesses have gone broke around Australia under this government, we think it is the wrong time to do that. So, it does remove that and also the change to the instant asset tax write-off—just lifting it from 20 to 30 and making it permanent. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important that, in this place, there is always much said about support for small to medium business, but there isn't always the follow through when it comes to the actions that will make a real difference. Small to medium businesses perform much of the heavy lifting of our economy. Together, they account for more than half of the nation's GDP, and contribute over $500 billion to our economy, providing almost 70 per cent of local employment. Small businesses are struggling. The MYOB Business Monitor found that 33 per cent of revenue declined in small business for December 2025. It also found that 24 per cent of small businesses were struggling with maintaining cashflow. A fifth of small to medium businesses are still under pressure because of late payment from customers, consistent with the increased inflationary pressure we're seeing across the economy. The pressure of subsequent rental increases, cost of utilities, fuel prices, rising supply costs, lower consumer spending, the difficulty of finding and retaining staff, and, of course, much increased insurance premiums, all continue to have a really negative impact on small to medium business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do more in this place to stand up for small business. The government's amendment today has highlighted that small business is sometimes an afterthought, I would say, because I am critical that this bill is a bill that addresses a lot of issues, and it slaps a lot of things together. The instant asset write-off is an important feature of the tax system and it should be made permanent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that effect, I supported the amendment by the member for Petrie, but I would urge the opposition to now come and stand with me on this amendment because it is incredibly important we do more. This program incentivizes investment but also improves cash flow, and I very much support making this permanent so that businesses can plan ahead, instead of having what they've had over the course of this parliament—an argy-bargy between government and opposition, which then saw these provisions not come into effect in the financial year needed, and businesses couldn't plan for and actually write off those assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this instant asset write-off needs to be increased to $50,000 at a minimum. It reflects the instant asset write-off measures provided to small businesses during the pandemic. We know that was effective and efficient. Small businesses are still struggling with the impacts of the pandemic, lower migration and high supply costs. These measures are supported by small-business groups and industries such as COSBOA, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and MYOB as well as industry groups such as the National Electrical and Communications Association. They all support this instant asset write-off being increased to $50,000. Increasing it to $50,000 would assist with the rising cost of goods and services and the urgent need to stimulate growth in productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These businesses need room to breathe. The rise of online cybersecurity will see a significant cost impact on small business. There has been a 20 per cent increase in the cost of goods since the pandemic. For construction businesses, building costs have risen by 40 per cent since 2020. Costs of commercial vehicles have increased by 104 per cent since January 2020. All of these issues identify how $20,000, whilst a good start, is simply not sufficient to genuinely help small business. So increasing it to $50,000 will provide that extra room for companies to provide wage increases and employ more casual and part-time workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will make a difference when we're looking at the challenges small businesses face, especially the opportunity to electrify and to get some sustainability and some efficiency within their operations. It simply cannot be done for $20,000. For example, the reality for a small business that owns their premises and wants to put solar on the rooftop, get a battery, electrify their fleet, get some efficiencies around their air-conditioning operations or get new plants or new infrastructure is that all of these things will be significantly more than $20,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met with the chambers of commerce and many small businesses in my electorate. They are desperately asking the government and the opposition to come together with a meaningful change so that small businesses can improve their cash flow, invest in their structure, increase their productivity and ultimately employ more people within our community. I urge the opposition: be more than just words and more than just promises at election time. Come and stand with us. I urge the government, of course, to do so as well and vote for this to be a $50,000 asset write-off for small businesses.</span>

The Greens support increasing and extending the instant asset write-off, which allows small businesses to claim an immediate deduction for the business portion of the cost of an asset in the year the asset is first used. The Greens understand how important small businesses are to our communities and the broader economy. I very much understand this myself from deep and long-term personal experience. For half a century, I was a director of my own practice and of small and then medium businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses make a huge contribution to Australian society and the economy. We also know that too many small businesses are struggling right now in the wake of the pandemic and with high inflation and interest rates. These important employers of so many Australians need some extra support. Extending the instant asset write-off will give small businesses the certainty that they need, as the member for Warringah mentioned, to invest in their businesses, which will have flow-on effects for their customers, workers, the communities they're based in and, indeed, the whole Australian community.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I would like to speak to a slightly different piece of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Incentives and Integrity) Bill, if I could. With respect to the instant asset write-offs, I did want to draw the chamber's attention to the fact that I think, in many cases, this bill is being misused by some consumers, particularly with respect to the write-off of the luxury car tax discounts. Essentially the issue here is people using this tax law to write off utility vehicles when in many instances it's reasonable to conclude that the vehicles are actually being purchased for non-commercial purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the cars bought in Australia in 2023, nearly a quarter of them were light utility vehicles or utes—that's 3.1 million vehicles purchased in that year. There are only 1.94 million tradies in Australia, so it's reasonable to assume that in many instances these vehicles are not being purchased for commercial purposes but, rather, are being used by individuals for non-commercial purposes. That being the case, it's not appropriate that the luxury car tax is giving these people a tax cut. It would make sense that we change this legislation such as to exclude those luxury utility vehicles from the commercial vehicle exemption. I've written to the Treasurer about this in the past but not yet received a response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that tradies who are actually using their cars for work are unlikely to be adversely affected because of this, because the models of their choosing are below the luxury car tax threshold. I put that before the House and before the Assistant Treasurer, in terms of the fact that it's inappropriate for us to continue to give tax breaks to people who don't need them and shouldn't deserve them. We should be working as actively as we can to use taxpayers' money for good rather than giving tax breaks to people who buy enormous superutes.</span>

We want to make sure our budget is better than the current government's, and that's why we decided to lift it to $30,000 and make it permanent. As a former small-business owner and a former contractor, and someone who worked in trades for 15 years, I understand the value of the instant asset tax write-off; I think a lot of the coalition do.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the member for Kooyong, I've got no idea what she's talking about. An attack on tradies wanting to use utes? You've got to be kidding me! I used to run a pest control business and I had nine pest controllers, and every single one of them had a dual cab ute or an extra cab ute that they used for work. If they take their family off in that dual cab ute on the weekend, off to lunch or something—you want to reduce that; is that right? Is that what you want to do for the people of Kooyong and right around Australia? The ute is a genuine tax deduction, and I can guarantee you one thing: if I'm Assistant Treasurer we won't be getting rid of tax-free thresholds and any sort of deduction on utes, that is for sure. I challenge the member for Kooyong to go out and talk to the tradies in her electorate—or perhaps we'll get Amelia Hamer to go out and talk to the people in her electorate. It's an outrageous suggestion. It is a slur on everyone who drives a ute to say, 'This is some sort of tax dodge to have a ute.' It just shows how out of touch some of these members in this place are. That is definitely one of the worst amendments I've seen in 12 years in this place. That someone would stand up and say something like that is a slur on every tradie, every bricklayer, every builder and every person that works in the offices for those companies. It's wrong.</span>

It shouldn't be just a question of picking numbers that are politically convenient to one side or the other. It would be useful for the industry and small businesses to understand the reason for the calculation of the $20,000. The very point of it is that it's meaningful for small businesses. The $20,000 does not allow for putting solar on your roof or for putting in a battery or getting efficiency and sustainability within operations—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise here today to pay tribute to my very dear friend and colleague the Hon. Warren Pitt AM. Warren was a teacher. He was a serviceman in the Reserves before serving as the member for Mulgrave—the Labor member for Mulgrave, I might add—in the Queensland parliament for nearly 20 years. He passed away peacefully in Gordonvale, south of Cairns, on 7 February. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He and I shared a constituency in my early days at Yarrabah, and we worked closely together, advocating for the community. He would frequently call me up and say: 'Warren, I'm going over to Yarrabah to see the constituents. Would you like to come?' I would always say yes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd meet him on the Bruce Highway turn-off on the way to Yarrabah, hop into his vehicle, ALP1, and together the 'Two Warrens' would head to Yarrabah to pay a visit to our constituents. I handled federal matters; he did the state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Warren was diagnosed with cancer, I continued visiting Yarrabah on behalf of us both, with my office working with his office to make sure that all of these issues were addressed. I did it because of the friendship that we had, and that friendship endured through all of his illness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warren, alongside his wife, Linda—who was always willing to be part of supporting Warren—were and will always be a part of Mulgrave. That's why I submitted a proposal to name an overpass after them. It had to be both of them. They were a pair from the beginning. We now have the Warren and Linda Pitt Way, which stands as a tribute to their work in Gordonvale. I wish him well on his next journey. He will never be forgotten. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Over many years, Lara and her colleagues have undertaken significant research into the abuse and obfuscation which has occurred within the organisation. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that the Jehovah's Witnesses was not an organisation which responded adequately to abuse. The research undertaken by Lara and her colleagues is comprehensive and builds upon this finding. Lara's research suggest that the lessons of the history of abuse have not been fully learnt and taken to heart in the ongoing operations of the organisation. Disturbingly, Lara told me that, in the six years of the operation of the Redress Scheme, there have been only two successful applications from victims of abuse within the Jehovah's Witness community. The report produced by the Joint Standing Committee on Implementation of the National Redress Scheme last year covers a great deal of ground on this subject. In particular, the inquiry found that it appeared possible that the Jehovah's Witnesses misled the joint standing committee in its evidence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that a legacy of abuse and mismanagement must be addressed in all its aspects. The antidote is scrutiny. I look forward to continuing to work with Lara and to advocate for action on this important issue. </span>

The opposition leader took leadership on this issue nearly two years ago. The coalition's position is to ban gambling ads one hour before, during and one hour after live sports broadcasts. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our bill was put to the Senate, but Labor and the Greens voted against it. Last week, the Greens put forward their own bill, and Independents in both the House and Senate have come forward with their own positions on gambling. Everyone is activated about this issue except for the Prime Minister. It is like the Prime Minister is dog paddling in the slow lane while everyone else is in an Olympic race to end gambling harm. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A coalition government would ensure that families enjoying the broadcast of their favourite sporting event will be protected from gambling ads, which we know cause harm, particularly to children. The Albanese Labor government is failing Australian families by doing nothing. It has been clear over the last week in particular that, even though everyone else is coming to the table and everyone else has a plan, the Albanese Labor government has no plan at all.</span>

From my first day as the member for Werriwa, I have been proud to represent the hardworking people of Macquarie Fields. I have friends—too many to number—who call 2564 home. You'll never find more decent folk than those where Macquarie Fields is located. To correct the record: Macquarie Fields does indeed have its own beach—Simmos Beach, at the end of Fifth Avenue. It's a beautiful area used by locals for years and years for swimming and picnics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on a more serious note, I'm proud of Labor's track record for Macquarie Fields. With my state colleague Anoulack Chanthivong and the election of a New South Wales Labor government, Transport for NSW are upgrading Macquarie Fields Station. In November last year, first works were started for the upgrades so long overdue and neglected by successive Liberal governments. The Albanese government has also committed to a university study hub to give residents opportunities to go to university that they've not previously had. There have also been upgrades for James Meehan High School. The list goes on and on, and 90 seconds can't do it justice. But making glib remarks about the people who live in Macquarie Fields isn't helpful and isn't okay. I will miss representing Macquarie Fields, but I know the friendships that I have there will endure.</span>

Many towns across regional Australia are far too familiar with regular and lengthy power outages, especially in extreme weather. To be clear: this isn't because of renewables or even because of our aging coal-fired power stations. Increasingly, small towns on the edge of the main grid have their power cut because of something called the rapid earth fault current limiter. These sensitive devices switch the powerline off instantly if a fault is detected, to reduce the risk of a bushfire. Of course this is an important safety measure, but the effects of a power outage are terrible. Businesses are forced to shut, and it's often the elderly and the sick who suffer the most when there's no electricity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Successive governments from both major parties have neglected these regional townships. They focus more on getting power to the major cities. But regional, edge-of-grid towns deserve reliable and secure power supply. Microgrids involving a system of solar, diesel and battery storage connected to businesses, households and community buildings can be a solution. During extreme weather events a microgrid can separate from the network to supply the power. We must invest in better energy resilience to ensure our businesses can operate, our food doesn't spoil and we can all stay comfortable as the climate changes. I call on the government—any government—to do better for power supply to regional— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Yesterday the government announced a $573.3 million investment in women's health to deliver more choice, lower costs and better health care for women. The package of measures includes the first PBS listing for new oral contraceptive pills in more than 30 years. Brands Yaz and Yasmin will go on the PBS, saving hundreds of dollars a year for over 50,000 women. It also includes the first PBS listing for new menopausal hormonal therapies in over 20 years. You've then got more choice, lower costs and better access to long-term contraceptives, with larger Medicare payments and more bulk-billing for IUDs and birth-control implants, saving around 300,000 women a year up to $400 in out-of-pocket costs. Then there are more endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics treating more conditions, with the opening of 11 new clinics and ensuring all 33 clinics, including the one in Bennelong, are staffed to provide specialist support for menopause.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always strengthen Medicare. In less than three years we've invested record amounts in bulk-billing; we've opened over 80 new Medicare urgent care clinics, including one in Top Ryde, which is open 8 am to 10 pm, seven days a week, fully bulk-billed; and we've saved Australians over $1 billion on the cost of their medicines. You just need to compare our approach on Medicare to that of the Liberals. It's in their DNA to oppose and attack Medicare, and it's ours to make it better and defend it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  The people of Warringah are frustrated with outdated road infrastructure that fouls our area's needs. Heavy traffic congestion plagues residents across the electorate and will continue to impact the North Sydney area once the Western Harbour Tunnel has been completed. Both New South Wales Labor and Liberal governments have shelved the Northern Beaches link tunnel and have proposed no other solutions. While transport remains a state issue, it's essential that clean public transport be prioritised.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More can be done federally to improve these issues. In 2019, Infrastructure Australia recognised that the Northern Beaches to North Sydney corridor was the fourth most congested in Sydney's evening peaks, and it remains on the Infrastructure Australia priority list. Last year, I was briefed by the New South Wales government on the outcomes of their Northern Beaches network review. Two items of very high priority, with $20 million of funding for planning for upgrades, are the Warringah Road-Pittwater Road Officeworks intersection and the Pacific Highway Chatswood-Roseville intersection. The Officeworks intersection was on Infrastructure Australia's infrastructure priority list in July 2021. This intersection is a key bottleneck along the Northern Beaches to North Sydney corridor, so I require the federal government's support. The state government have indicated that they would welcome a sharing of the costs and partnership, so I call on the government to commit to working with the New South Wales government on a 50/50 split for funding these works.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  The Footscray community, within my electorate of Fraser, has long been a melting pot of cultural and personal expression. The area is home to many creative individuals and organisations who play a vital role in producing the art that defines and redefines our culture. Despite the existence of such a longstanding, storied creative culture in the west, with many who have achieved nationally and internationally, the local arts industry has for many years been deprived of much-needed infrastructure. In particular, there are very few large performing arts centres in Melbourne's west. Without adequate investment in performance spaces, the artists of Melbourne's west will be limited in their opportunities. This will hamper the development of a sector that enriches us all. Creators and arts consumers of the west deserve the same access to the arts as their counterparts across the bridge.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Creative West project seeks to rectify this problem. The government recently committed $5 million to Creative West, which will be matched by Maribyrnong council. This precinct will ultimately include outdoor spaces, contemporary library facilities and, critically, a 500-seat performing arts and entertainment venue. Not only will this investment create substantial economic and social opportunities but it will also continue to foster the culture of creation and innovation that exists in Melbourne's west. I would like to thank the Maribyrnong City Council for joining the federal Labor government in making this vital investment possible.</span>

This community is like so many across Australia, struggling under a Labor government that has the wrong priorities and is making the wrong decisions. The last thing Corowa needed was to lose their bulk-billing GP clinic. Corowa Mediclinic closed in December, declaring their business unsustainable with a lack of external support and medical staff. This was devastating for hundreds of mainly older patients, many now forced to, hopefully, find a doctor in Albury, a 90-minute round trip away.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in this place, the shutdown is no surprise. Despite those opposite happily parroting their 'party of Medicare' mantra, it's a false reality. Last month, a study found bulk-billing in retreat, and out-of-pocket costs up $40 on average. Cleanbill's <span style="font-style:italic;">Blue Report </span>says that almost 80 per cent of available Australian GP clinics no longer offer bulk-billing to adult patients. Delivered with the petition of 800 signatures was a request to review support, reimbursement and staff retention strategy for country practices. I'm pleased to say this is all possible—we just need a change of government. The coalition has already announced a $400 million commitment to incentivise junior doctors to train in general practice to help fill shortages. We've also pledged support to help recruit and retain healthcare workers to ensure Corowa—indeed, all Australians—have access to timely and affordable health care, no matter where they live.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I was honoured to attend a celebration of the life of a great Territorian, Stephen Goodall, last month in Darwin. I'm wearing one of his ties and his matching pocket squares here, and I want to thank Karen Green for distributing those to Stephen's friends at the event. It is a great way to remember him.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He made significant contributions to the Northern Territory's business, community, workforce and policy landscape, with an unwavering dedication to the Territory's growth and development. Like some other great Australians, Stephen was actually born a Kiwi in New Zealand, but he made Australia his home, and he personified the best of the Anzac spirit in that dedication to his new home of Australia. He was identified in the Australian Army as a leader in the military with ambition and true grit. He carried these qualities across into his civilian life, as evidenced in all the condolences from his family and many friends and colleagues across Australia and overseas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stephen touched the lives of us all with his kindness, generosity and mentorship. He built relationships, fostered collaboration and conveyed complex ideas to drive the Northern Territory forward. My condolences to his friends, colleagues and golf buddies, and we know he is now with his wife, Alma, who passed away a year before him. To both Stephen and Alma, rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  I rise to commend Gosford's oldest train driver, Mr John Szabo, who is this year marking 56 years of driving trains in New South Wales. John is an incredible public servant, whose career started following high school in 1969. John began as a trainee engineman on steam trains in Sydney before moving on to driving diesel trains in 1976. Nowadays, John continues driving trains, although they are a little different to the steam trains of yesteryear that he started his career on. John drives trains all along the Sydney-Central Coast-Newcastle line which has about a million passenger trips per month. It's a very busy line across the public transport network and one that requires an experienced train driver like John.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that our community is so appreciative of John's commitment over the past 5½ decades. I'd like to take the opportunity today in this chamber of the Australian parliament to formally recognise John Szabo and to thank him for his unwavering dedication to public transport, to the people of New South Wales and our incredible place that we call home, the Central Coast. It is one of the greatest places in this country, if not the world. I know the member for Hunter might disagree with me, but the Central Coast is one of the best places on earth. Also, I'd like to make a quick shout out to my mother-in-law, Mandy Hilton. Happy birthday! I hope you have a great day!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Professor Matthew Campen from the University of New Mexico has in a recent study come forward with a rather startling revelation that we may be walking around with up to a spoonful of microplastics which are 100 thousandths of the width of a human hair in our brain. They've crossed the blood brain barrier and are now exacerbating conditions such as dementia. Microplastics such as these come from tyres, cosmetics and clothing, but they also come from wind turbine blades, as clearly pointed out in the November 2024 report by the Department of Wind and Energy Systems at the Technical University of Denmark. There's up to a kilogram of microplastics per year per blade. These microplastics blow off the blade and onto the pasture to be eaten by cattle, then consumed by you, and they enter into your bloodstream and into your brain. Or they enter into the sea to be eaten by the fish which are consumed by you, and they enter into your bloodstream and into your brain.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Tamara Galloway, professor of ecotoxicology at the University of Exeter, stated, you cannot treat the environment as one big dumping ground. That is how your intermittent power targets and wind turbine blades are treating our countryside and our sea. You may not be able to see the intermittent power wind turbine blades in New England or off the coast of the member for Wannon's electorate, but don't worry; you get to eat some of them later on—but, later on, you may not remember it.</span>

That tragic day is forever etched in our nation's memory. Fuelled by extreme heat, nearly 400 fires burned across Victoria. More than 19,000 CFA personnel responded, selflessly sacrificing their time and in some cases their lives to protect others. The devastation reached communities across the state, including suburbs once thought safe. Homes were lost even in our own community, in Narre Warren South.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we have learned valuable lessons that have helped save lives, bushfire seasons are becoming more intense. We saw this with the Black Summer fires of 2019, the recent Los Angeles wildfires and this year's fires in the Grampians. Investments in data and aircraft are vital, but they mean little without firefighters on the front line. I thank all firefighters in Holt, especially those at Hampton Park, Narre Warren, Clyde, Devon Meadows, Tooradin and Warneet-Blind Bight CFAs, for their dedication to protecting our community every single day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to announce that an elected coalition government will invest $674,000 to upgrade the field lighting at Gwawley Park's north oval. This funding will ensure the members of the Taren Point Titans Rugby League Club as well as the Taren Point Touch Association can play and train safely in the evenings.

Female players don't have private showers, don't have room for a physio and don't have their own purpose-built change rooms. If elected, a coalition government will contribute $4 million, to be matched by the Cronulla Sharks, to construct change rooms for those teams. I'm proud to deliver for the thousands of locals who've got behind this initiative.</span>

Preparing the fields for this volume of use is no easy task, and the club is dependent on so many volunteers. That's why an elected Liberal government would contribute $35,000 to fund a new line-marking machine.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  At a women's health forum I held with the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ged Kearney, women spoke openly about the challenges they've faced within the health system. They shared stories of being ignored, dismissed and discouraged. Their stories have stayed with me ever since. They deserve a government that is willing to invest in their health and their future. That's what this Labor government is doing. We've announced half a billion dollars in funding to support better health outcomes for women—listing two contraceptive pills on the PBS, increasing Medicare payments on IUDs, more support for women experiencing menopause and more endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've created a Reid women's health reference group to support the courageous local women who are helping shine a light on women's health needs. I'm delighted that dozens of women are taking part in the group. They are GPs, surgeons, researchers, gynaecologists, physios and women with lived experience. They've identified the priority health issues for women in my local community, and it's wonderful to see some of those issues already being addressed by the Labor government. A member of that group said to me, 'Women shouldn't have to suffer in silence,' and I'm pleased to be part of a government that is finally listening to women.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  The Rockhampton-Yeppoon Road is a critical lifeline connecting the Capricorn Coast to Rockhampton and beyond. It's a road thousands of locals rely on every day, but for too long it has been in desperate need of upgrades.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand just how important road safety is for our community, whether it's families heading to work and school, transport operators keeping goods moving or visitors exploring our region, everyone deserves safe and efficient roads. That's why I fought hard and secured $85 million under the former coalition government's Investment Road and Rail Program to deliver these much-needed improvements. This funding is making real change happen. Work is now around halfway complete, with major upgrades extending the road to four lanes between Ironpot and Hedlow Creek. Once finished, this project will significantly improve how people travel between Yeppoon and Rockhampton, reducing congestion, making journeys safer and ensuring a more efficient network for the 11,000 daily commuters who rely on it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But while the coalition delivers for regional Australia, Labor does the opposite. Since coming to government Labor has cut billions from regional infrastructure funding, delaying and scrapping critical projects in communities like ours. They take regional Australia for granted, and our roads and communities are paying the price. Only the coalition truly understands the importance of investing in regional roads. Unlike Labor, we back infrastructure projects that improve safety, drive economic growth and support local jobs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  There is a frustrating pattern in Australian politics at the moment, and it's coming from those opposite. They are a group so committed to saying no they should be rebranded as the blockers. If progress was a freeway, this lot would be the never-ending roadworks. They would be the workers in hi-vis holding the 'slow' sign, except they wouldn't let any traffic through.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government moves to cut the cost of medicines, what do those opposite say? No. We say fee-free TAFE. What do they say? No. We say pay rises for aged-care and childcare workers. What do they say? No. We build Medicare urgent care clinics. Funnily enough, what do they say to this? No.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They claim to stand for economic responsibility. Blocking cheaper medicines and better health care doesn't just hurt people, it costs more in the long run. The only thing the blockers are constantly in favour of is taxpayer funded lunches for the corporate bosses. They say no to pay rises for minimum wage workers but yes to another round of oysters and champagne for their CEO mates—because nothing says economic responsibility like a three-course meal off the back of the taxpayer dollar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I woke up 2.30 this morning, fell back to sleep at about 5.30 and then the alarm went off at six. Thank you, menopause. I'm not on my own. Thousands of women are like me right across the country. For generations we've been sucking it up and putting up with it. We're saying, 'No more!' Finally, we've got a government that cares about women and their health. We are going to be more productive. We are going to make it easier and cheaper to get health care for women, and that's a good thing.</span>

But, let me tell you, they care about their health care too. When I talk to people in my seat, when I knock on their door, they say: 'Meryl, I care about the health of my kids, my parents and myself.'</span>

We are taking it seriously because this is a serious government that puts serious policies in place. We want all Australians to be healthy from the cradle to the grave, and we are investing in your health. We care about your health, not like those opposite who wanted to impose GP taxes and rip the money out of health. We're putting it back in right now.</span>

As the Australian people know, I will always stand up for them. I will always stand up for Australia's national interests, and it is in Australia's national interests to have a free and fair trade. This government has a strong record, indeed, of working with other nations to protect and advance Australia's trade interests. We will navigate any differences which are there diplomatically, and we will continue to make the case to the United States for Australia to be given an exemption to any steel and aluminium tariffs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have raised with the US administration in recent ministerial discussions these issues. Australian steel and aluminium are core imports to US supply chains and US based industry. Indeed, just this morning, I had a meeting with the global CEO of Rio Tinto. Australian companies have significant investment in the US steel industry, creating thousands of jobs in both the US and Australia. We will continue to make the case for Australia's national interests with the US administration. What's more, we regard this as also being in the US's national interests because tariffs, of course, don't tax us; they tax the purchasers of our products. That is something that is very clear. It's also a fact that the US has had a trade surplus with Australia since the Truman presidency. I have a discussion with President Trump scheduled, and I will certainly keep the House and the Australian people informed after that discussion.</span>

Yesterday we announced a historic $573 million for women's health, delivering more choice, lower costs and better health care for women. Our new investment includes the first PBS listing for new oral contraceptive pills in more than 30 years; last century was the last time that a government made a difference here. It includes more bulk-billing and bigger Medicare payments for long-term contraceptives, the first PBS listing for new menopausal hormone therapy in over 20 years, and more endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics, treating more conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will save women thousands of dollars. Australian women asked for change, and we are delivering it. This announcement builds on the other work we've done to strengthen Medicare: tripling the bulk-billing incentive so that more people can see a GP for free; making medicines cheaper, saving Australians more than $1 billion already as a direct result of that change; 87 urgent care clinics—we promised 50 and we delivered 87; and health care when you need it. More than 1 million Australians have got free care as a result. So many of those Australians have been under the age of 15. And just last week we announced $1.7 billion of additional funding for public hospitals and health services next year. This will help to cut waiting lists, it will reduce waiting times in emergency rooms and it will help with the ramping issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in stark contrast to the alternative approach. We know that the Leader of the Opposition was voted Australia's worst health minister. His idea of getting Medicare on track was a funding freeze and a GP tax. His idea of getting public hospitals on track was to rip $50 billion out of their funding and to have a new hospital tax. All the opposition leader's tracks end up in the same place: Australians worse off and people paying more. </span>

But also our defence minister, over the weekend, met with the US defence minister. And our foreign minister was of course one of the few international representatives invited to the inauguration. We will continue to engage diplomatically with the United States—not with loudhailers, but diplomatically. That is how we have got things done in our relationships right around the world. </span>

It's an enormous privilege to be a part of a caucus that has been delivering for women, and I acknowledge the member for Canberra's role in that. I, as the Minister representing the Minister for Women, particularly want to thank her as well as the fantastic Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care. This package would not have happened without her and her incredibly hard work. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is building Australia's future. We are strengthening Medicare with an investment of more than half a billion dollars to deliver more choice, lower costs and better health care for women. Women have asked the government to make their health care a priority, and we have listened. We've announced a comprehensive package—half a billion dollars—that works together to give women more choices across their lifetime. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the most commonly used contraceptive pills are being listed on the PBS. They will save women who use them between $250 and $350 a year. The PBS listing of common menopause hormone therapies will save women using these treatments up to $290 a year or up to $577 a year if you have a concession card. These new PBS listings—the first new oral contraceptive to be listed in 30 years and the first new menopausal hormone therapies to be listed in 20 years—will take effect from 1 March, in just three weeks time. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also boost Medicare rebates for the insertion of IUDs and birth-control implants by up to 150 per cent, saving up to $400 in out-of-pocket costs for women accessing these devices—and that's around 300,000 women. We'll also introduce a new Medicare rebate of around $110 for menopause health assessments so that women can get the care and support they need from their family GP. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also going to be trialling accessing contraceptives and treatment for uncomplicated UTIs—which are very common amongst women, but not just women—directly from pharmacists. This means that women can get the treatment they need quickly but without the added cost of a doctor's visit or in some cases having to go to emergency departments because GP clinics are simply not open. These are very common conditions, and I know this will have a material impact on the way in which women can access care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a package that recognises that women bear a higher cost. But what we know from those opposite is that all of this is at risk. The Leader of the Opposition has form when it comes to cuts to health care. I was the shadow health minister when he tried to introduce a GP tax—something we be fought very hard against. All of these investments are at risk under those opposite. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:12</span>):  My question is to the Prime Minister. In five years, rents have increased by 55 per cent and house prices by 49 per cent. The income a renter needs to buy a median priced house in a capital city is $197,000, yet the housing minister says Labor wants house prices to keep rising. Will Labor stop giving property investors with multiple properties big tax handouts that turbocharge house prices and deny renters the chance to buy a home and instead finally phase out negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount? </span>

Indeed, fixing the affordable housing shortage is a big challenge for Australia. We have a plan that is focused on supply, because that is the key, whether you want to be a homeowner or you are a renter or someone in social and affordable housing. That's why our $32 billion Homes for Australia plan is worthy of the support of everyone in this parliament—I note that the crossbenchers eventually, reluctantly, got there. They crab-walked their way to vote for some of the plans that were put forward. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last sitting week of December, we passed our build-to-rent incentives that are so important for private renters in Australia, to make a major difference. Those opposite here are still opposed to it. They say, 'Tax cuts for corporates.' This is the same mob that wants every single person who has any vague connection with a business to have a free lunch for themselves and their mates. They don't regard $10 billion for three months for their mates as largesse, but they are opposed to funding for social and public housing. They are opposed to more investment in private rentals and they are opposed to our shared equity scheme that will make a difference as well. The model has been successful in Western Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are getting on with the job of building 1.2 million homes. Indeed, there are other things we are doing as well. We're training more tradies, with more apprenticeships, 20,000 fee-free TAFE places in construction and the $10,000 apprenticeship incentives that I announced at the National Press Club—something unfamiliar to most of those opposite—just before Australia Day. There's the local infrastructure announcements that we have made—two rounds of local infrastructure announcements facilitating the building of new homes, whether that be through connecting electricity, connecting water or making sure that any impediments to more housing supply are removed. Our social housing policy will lead to 55,000 homes being built. We have also provided increased rent assistance in back-to-back budgets, now more than 45 per cent higher than at the election, in addition to helping 200,000 people into their first home sooner.</span>

She worked so hard on this package. But I am delighted to take in her stead the question from the member for Boothby, who is such a terrific advocate for good health policy in her community in Adelaide and in this chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has no higher priority than strengthening Medicare, and you simply can't be serious about strengthening Medicare without being serious about women's health. Women consume about 60 per cent of all health services in this country and they face significant costs, as every woman in this chamber and at home knows, simply because they are women, particularly costs around contraception and reproductive health and costs during the period of perimenopause and menopause later in life. Two really important Senate inquiries over the course of this term of parliament have shone a spotlight on the decades of neglect, inaction and poor service that women have received in these two areas. The assistant minister worked so hard with her advisory council to workshop solutions to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday was a great day for women's health in this country. Finally, we reversed decades of that neglect and inaction and have delivered women more choice, better affordability, lower costs and better access to high-quality services. We are delivering more choice and lower cost in the important area of contraception. We have some of the highest rates of unplanned pregnancies and terminations in the developed world. We have declining rates of prescription of oral contraceptives. We have some of the lowest rates of access to IUDs and implants in the developed world. The reasons for that are pretty clear. They are very hard to access and too often they are far too expensive. This package changes that. There's more training for GPs on insertions and removals, higher fees for doctors providing those services and, as the Minister representing the Minister for Women said, the first new listings on the PBS for oral contraceptives in more than three decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The menopause inquiry also showed decades of poor literacy in our healthcare system and poor service for women going through perimenopause and menopause. Doctors are provided only one hour of training on menopause across their entire six-year degree. Again, we will provide better training, better clinical guidelines and better funded Medicare services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unsurprisingly, this package has been broadly welcomed by doctor groups, nursing groups, pharmacy groups and, most importantly, women's organisations themselves. We're so grateful for that support and so grateful for the input that they are having. This will truly deliver women more choice, lower costs and better services in the future.</span>

Given that the minister has spent all of his answer dealing with one or the other, he's clearly in order.</span>

                  </a>  I'm going to listen carefully, but the minister is on topic because part of the question says, 'How are the figures much lower than those when the coalition was in government?' I suggest to the manager and the House that the minister is potentially not agreeing with that and arguing the point in the question. So, whilst he was asked about figures, he was also asked about the previous government, because that was mentioned in the question, so he'll have to address that part of the question to talk about the previous government. If he wasn't asked about figures in a previous term or a previous government, he wouldn't be able to talk about that, but he is being directly relevant. But I just want to make sure that, with his remarks, he is being directly relevant to that part of the question.</span>

                  </a>  The history of bulk-billing over the last several years, which is the point of the question, is very clear. When the Leader of the Opposition, the former health minister, was not able to get his GP tax through the Senate, instead he initiated a six-year freeze to the Medicare rebate that the College of GPs said, when we were coming into government, had resulted in a freefall in bulk-billing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have put in record investments to turn that around, but, if there is an issue with bulk-billing in this country—and we'd like to see it higher than it currently is—it all lies at the feet of this man, the Leader of the Opposition, who, as the Prime Minister said, was voted by Australia's doctors as the worst health minister in the history of Medicare. If that verdict is not enough, perhaps another verdict is that former prime minister Tony Abbott thought he was so bad, he didn't even let him deliver a second health budget.</span>

                  <a href="DYW" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Arts, Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Cyber Security, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  I thank the member for Hunter for raising what is a very important issue in what he has described as the 'golden ticket' visa, or what has otherwise historically been known as 'cash for visas' for the very simple reason that it's a visa you qualify for because you have cash. On 31 July last year, this government closed applications for that visa. No-one has been able to apply for the visa since then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will take some time to deal with the mess that was created by the previous government on that, a mess which was contributed to by a lack of compliance staff. Before I get to the lack of compliance staff, I'll explain—just to go a little bit further on this visa—that the Productivity Commission had made clear that, in a program where you have a limited number of permanent visa applications that get approved, every one of these visas takes away from another part of the program, and, when they have costed what it takes away from permanent skilled migration, the cost to the Australian economy—not our figures; Productivity Commission figures—is $2.5 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are good reasons why this government got rid of applications for that visa. The problems became embedded with the nature of the visa, as a visa you qualify for because you have cash, combined with an obsession from the Leader of the Opposition, when he held my job, with cutting the compliance staff within the department—the people who were employed to make sure that the system had integrity. They were the ones he targeted and took from 360 down to 203. It was the compliance staff that he decided to target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We first found out that this visa would be on the way back under the Leader of the Opposition not through an announcement. We know, from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Telegraph</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>it wasn't because of a shadow cabinet process or a party room process—no, no, no. This came about, we found out, because someone asked him a question at a fundraiser, and, once again, there was a boom mic overhead. That's how the public found out about this. I'll tell you what: for the Australian people, that was not a free lunch. That one was in no way a free lunch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The Productivity Commission on cash for visas had said 'there is no case' for retaining this category of permanent visa.

We have legislated to criminalise the glorifying of terrorist acts and the possession of violent extremist material. We have legislated to criminalise doxxing; those opposite voted against that. Now the parliament has come together to pass a bill which criminalises hate speech. It is legislation that represents the toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes. The legislation is a direct response to the hateful conduct happening on our streets, at our schools and in our communities. We are sending a clear and unambiguous message that advocating or threatening violence is not acceptable. It is criminal behaviour and it will be treated as such.</span>

                  </a>  To try to shut down the minister. Given the statements that have been made by many members of the opposition about a range of people on this side of the House, the idea that the minister should withdraw a statement is quite frankly totally inconsistent with things that have been said by those opposite over a considerable period of time. The minister, due to who he is—the idea that he is not a strong opponent of antisemitism. He is someone who feels this very personally and deeply. He was being interjected against by those opposite in behaviour that I regard as completely disorderly and completely unacceptable.</span>

                  </a>  A couple of points. Firstly, you've requested that the Attorney-General withdraw, which I think is the right course of action. The Speaker has made that request. Secondly, the question was in relation to mandatory minimum sentencing. There was no invective in the question targeted at the Attorney-General. The Prime Minister somehow said that the Attorney-General was goaded into his unparliamentary remarks, but that is not an excuse in any way. Quite frankly, it is clear cut here that there are few more disgusting accusations that could be made in this House. You've requested that the Attorney-General withdraw, and he should.</span>

                  </a>  Just so that we're clear, now that I have the picture—you're saying that the word 'disgusting' should be withdrawn? That is not unparliamentary and has been used. This is an emotive debate. I can appreciate that. Members have every right to feel grievances on either side. I want this debate to continue. I want question time to function. I will hear from the Leader of the House.</span>

                  </a>  A second point of order was raised by the manager during that with respect to relevance. On that, I want to say that the question referred to an amendment to a piece of legislation. The Attorney-General has been referring to that piece of legislation. You can't refer to the penalties without referring to the crime, and therefore it is completely relevant to what was asked.</span>

                  </a>  Just to be very clear: the words we are offended by and seeking that the Attorney-General withdraw are that we're politicising antisemitism. That would be quite an extraordinary ruling—for this House to allow an accusation like that to be made. To the Leader of the House's point, I only raised the context of the question in response to the Prime Minister, who somehow stated that the Attorney-General was goaded into his unparliamentary remarks, which was clearly not the case.</span>

                  </a>  Now that the Manager of Opposition Business has clarified what he wants withdrawn—withdrawal has to be made at the first opportunity. I would dispute that it was unparliamentary given what's been said by the opposition in a number of debates. But, notwithstanding that, the Manager of Opposition Business, after that point, stood up, went to the dispatch box and did not ask for it to be withdrawn. He chose to have the House vote instead. The House has now voted, and the answer should proceed.</span>

The argument that the Leader of the House puts is not that the words were unparliamentary. His point is that they weren't dealt with in the first instance. Again, that is an argument that fails because the course of action taken was that, given the offensive nature of it, we responded in a way that was obviously proportionate to what were disgusting comments. There is a long precedent—not to mention the fact, Mr Speaker, that your predecessors have required, even if they haven't heard the words themselves, for the minister to withdraw that statement. That was your instinct, rightly; that was your direction to the minister. And now, with the weight of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House trying to—</span>

                  </a>  I wish to raise concern about the arguments raised in this respect around—this is a policy issue, and it's clearly a decision of members of this House to disagree with government policy or to raise an issue in the context of question time around a policy. As such, describing that as politicising an issue is very much what it is. So I would submit that, if that is considered unparliamentary, or grounds for withdrawal or refusal, it would mean any area of policy where there is disagreement becomes something that is objectionable because it is essentially being politicised. So I am concerned at the way in which this is positioned because it's the same as the nature of a policy being racist or anything like that. These are policy differences, and that is the very nature of this place.</span>

I'm the son and the grandson of a Holocaust survivor. I went to the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, a place where a million Jews were murdered, a place where my great grandmother was murdered on 13 October 1942. And I say to members of this House that we've had a wave of antisemitism in this country, and right now what we need is unity. We need bipartisanship, and that's the effort that our government made with the bill that was passed by this parliament last week. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

And because of the work of this side of the House, there are tax cuts flowing to every taxpayer and there is energy bill relief to every household, cheaper medicines, cheaper early childhood education, more rent assistance, better wages, fee-free TAFE and, after the election, if we win, more student debt relief. We've been able to provide this cost-of- living help at the same time as we've delivered two surpluses in our first two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of our responsible economic management, inflation is down, wages are up and unemployment is low. On the inflation front, we got a very important and interesting contribution today from the economists at Westpac. They said, when they dramatically lowered their expectations for inflation this quarter and next quarter, that 'core inflation is moderating faster than anticipated' and 'the moderation in core inflation is fundamental'. Westpac have lowered their forecast for headline inflation to two per cent in this quarter and 1.7 per cent next quarter, which is not just within the Reserve Bank's target band but below it. And for trimmed mean underlying inflation they're now expecting 2.7 this quarter and 2.4 next quarter, which is not just within the target band but in the lower half of the target band.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to office, inflation was much higher and rising. Now it is lower and falling. That's because this side of the House has been focused on the cost of living while that side of the House has focused on cuts, conflict and culture wars. After three years of opposition, those opposite still don't have any costed, coherent or credible economic policies. All they have are secret costs and secret cuts which will make people worse off. The reason they will make people worse off on that side of the House is that they can't find $10 billion a year for free long lunches, or they can't find the $350 billion in cuts that they say they want to impose, or they can't find the $600 billion they need for this nuclear fantasy without going after Medicare again, without going after pension indexation, without going after housing and without going after wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the choice at the election is going to be really clear: that coalition of cuts and conflict and culture wars, making Australians worse off and taking Australia backwards, or this Prime Minister and his Labor government, getting on top of this inflation challenge, rolling out cost-of-living help, making things better for people when it comes to the tax cuts and energy bill relief, and building Australia's future. </span>

The member for Menzies is lost. He thinks he is in—I'm not sure—Spring Street. What my government has done is work constructively with state and territory governments across the board. We work constructively with the governments, for example, of Queensland Premier David Crisafulli and the Northern Territory Chief Minister Lia Finocchiaro, who I was with—there is a bit of an Italian connection with us three, of course. We work constructively not just on building the economy and creating jobs but on opposing this opposition's nuclear plan going forward, because that's absolutely friendless. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I did when I would have been with the Victorian Premier was to sign an agreement to deliver additional schools funding for every Victorian student, and I make no apologies for that as well—over $16 billion on the table to make sure every student in the great state of Victoria, just like we want in every state, gets the best opportunity in life through a better education. And the way you do that is by dealing with the reforms that were put in place and recommended by David Gonski all those years ago—14 years ago. But it has taken the re-election of a Labor government to fulfil the vision of David Gonski and another great Victorian representative, former prime minister Julia Gillard. That is what we are doing. Just last week we had $1.7 billion, including substantial additional funding for Victorian hospitals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for the member for Menzies is: Is he against that additional hospital funding? Is he against the additional education funding? Because the member for Menzies, when I was in his electorate, or what will be his electorate that he is running for at the next election, just a short while ago, when the Leader of the Opposition was advocating his new-found love of China and all things that are connected with China for the lunar new year—they were out there talking about 'getting back on track'. Now, every Australian will know what that means—back to rising inflation, back to wages deliberately low, back to aged care in crisis, back to bulk billing in freefall, back to child care being out of reach, back to chasing manufacturing offshore, back to veterans waiting years for benefits, back to chaos and multiple ministries; that is what they presided over. Keep that in mind next time you hear someone talk about 'back on track'. </span>

The member for Hawke gets it. He gets that an investment in early childhood education is an investment in an essential service that parents right across Australia rely on, a service that helps parents, especially women, get back into the workforce, and allows children to access those really transformational benefits of early childhood education and care. That's why the Albanese Labor government has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda, one that is principled on three pillars, underpinned by tackling affordability, supply and accessibility, and workforce stability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made significant progress across all of those three, but especially on affordability. Our cheaper childcare reforms have provided more than one million Australian families with cost-of-living relief by cutting the cost of early learning. Our departmental data shows that a family earning $120,000 a year, accessing 30 hours of early childhood education and care a week, are better off by $2,768 since September 2023. That's more than $2,000 better off because of the policies of this Albanese Labor government. And that's not all: we have linked our historic early childhood wage increase to fee caps so providers can't increase their fees by more than 4.4 per cent in the first year and 4.2 per cent in the second year—lifting workers' wages while putting downward pressure on fees for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked if there is anything that could put all of this at risk and leave families worse off. The risk is that the coalition will take us back to the days of high out-of-pocket expenses, when the cost of early childhood education skyrocketed by a staggering 49 per cent when they were last in government. The opposition don't have a policy, a plan or a vision for families or for early childhood education. Their only plan is $350 billion worth of cuts and a taxpayer funded long lunch. We will invest $1 billion to build early learning in the suburbs and the regions where they need them. We will guarantee every child has access to at least 72 hours of subsidised early childhood education and care per fortnight. We will continue to tackle affordability and out-of-pocket costs. We will ensure that early childhood education workers earn more and keep more of what they earn. Only a Labor government will take action to ensure Australian families have access to quality and affordable early childhood education and care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree about the question of intergenerational equity—and I have spoken about this, including in the speech that I gave at the National Press Club—because it is a genuine feeling that people have, arising out of the changed circumstances which are facing young Australians. Young Australians are very concerned about not just their economic position, the fast-changing nature of workplaces and their experiences in life but also about dealing with the challenge of climate change and the fact that people who say, 'You can't make a difference immediately,' forget the fact that generations who will inherit our climate are not ones that have benefited from the growth that came from fossil fuels in the 20th century and the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we have done is establish the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee. The Minister for Youth is very active in establishing an Office of Youth Affairs—it didn't exist before we were elected to government. We have delivered on our commitment to deliver a more robust intergenerational report in the middle of every year term, and one of the reasons we are targeting debt is it makes a difference. Debt is $177 billion lower in 2024-25 than what was forecast at the time of the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also, of course, investing in children's education, whether it be early education and early learning, with our childcare reforms and the school reforms I just spoke about—moving towards fair school funding as identified by Gonski all those years ago—right through to free TAFE and to universities. The cutting of student debt by 20 per cent is about intergenerational equity. It is about acknowledging the concern and pressure that young people are under. More than three million Australians will benefit by an average of $5,000 if we're re-elected as government, as one of the first actions that we will do will be to introduce that legislation in our second term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also, of course, building more homes for Australians, which is important. We're investing in future jobs through our future made in Australia. And our climate change action is the thing that young people, when I travel, particularly to high schools, raise with me perhaps more than any other issue around Australia, and I'm sure that's the case in the member for Mackellar's electorate as well.</span>

The Albanese government is firmly focused on the issues that matter to Australians: easing the cost of living whilst fighting inflation, and providing opportunities to upskill in a future made in Australia. As the Minister for Aged Care, I would argue that our commitment to delivering on these issues is best reflected through us prioritising aged-care workers. Since 2023, the Albanese government has invested more than $15 billion to increase the award wage for more than 250,000 aged-care workers. Under the Albanese government, registered nurses are earning an extra $14,685 every single year, and, with Labor's tax cuts, they're keeping an extra $1,745 in their pockets. Personal care workers with a certificate III are more than $10,573 a year better off. With Labor's tax cuts, they're also keeping an extra $1,166 in their pockets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, while we're helping aged-care workers earn more and keep more of what they earn, we're also making it more affordable for them to go to TAFE and to uni so that they can provide high-quality care to older Australians. This is helping workers like Elizabeth, whom I met at the South Bank TAFE a few weeks ago. Elizabeth is one of the 130,000 students who have enrolled in a care course through fee-free TAFE. Elizabeth has worked in aged care for two years, and she absolutely loves it. She told me, 'I feel like I have 100 bonus grandmothers and grandfathers as a result of my work.' Two years into aged care, Elizabeth was inspired to enrol in a diploma of nursing to become an enrolled nurse, something she could only dream of doing thanks to fee-free TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I was asked how the government's cost-of-living support for aged-care workers compares with the coalition's. I can tell the member for Werriwa that Elizabeth would be significantly worse off under the coalition, because those opposite have never supported a pay rise for aged-care workers and those opposite have never supported fee-free TAFE. Instead, the coalition's big, secretly costed policy is to allow companies to take potential clients out to taxpayer funded lunches and entertainment. So the news for Elizabeth is, under a coalition government, she wouldn't get a pay rise or tax cuts or affordable higher education. She wouldn't get help to care for her bonus grandfathers and grandmothers. But, according to the coalition's publicly defined parameters of their own policy, businesses could spend up to $20,000 of Elizabeth's own taxpayer funds to attend something like, for example, the Super Bowl to lather themselves in buffalo wings and baby back ribs, nodding along to Kendrick Lamar—all subsidised by the Australian taxpayer. This is just another reason why those opposite are not like us. They're not like us.</span>

                  </a>  In question time today, the health minister claimed that I'd initiated a pause on the indexation of Medicare rebates, which is not true. The member for Sydney, under the former Labor government, was health minister at the time when the pause on Medicare rebates was initiated in the 2013 budget. This is clearly stated on page 177 of Budget Paper No. 2 of May 2013. The then president of the RACGP said that Labor's 2013 indexation pause would slash $664 million out of primary healthcare services. When I was health minister, the bulk-billing rate was at 84 per cent; today it's at 77 per cent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  I begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal people. I thank them for their strong and continuing stewardship. The first word I heard in this place was Aunty Matilda House-Williams saying 'Welcome'. Matilda meant it, and I've always felt welcome on Ngunnawal traditional lands over the last 18 years. The second word I heard here was 'sorry'. Kevin Rudd's small word echoed big all around the nation and all around the world. It was long overdue and vital for us to recognise the manifest wrongs committed against our First Nations peoples. That word 'sorry' improved our international standing. So I heard 'welcome' and 'sorry' on my first day—and my best day—in parliament. I'm forever thankful that Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard and Jenny Macklin made that apology to the stolen generations happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that first day, Uncle Pat Dodson spoke of the oldest art on earth being Aboriginal works in Western Australia; Aunty Linda Burney talks of the oldest constructions in the world being Koori fish traps at Brewarrina; and my almost-cousin-in-law Marion Scrymgour has also helped guide me through our nation's duality. I once taught English for 11 years, but now I know that the oldest words on earth are Aboriginal words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The old and the new, the black and the white, the then and the now and the everywhen. Pat, Linda, Marion and so many other First Nations colleagues and friends like Peter Brown and Wayne Long in St George—if you're listening—have helped me better understand our past. What Australian wouldn't be proud of such a rich history? Our 'then' improves the 'now' and uplifts all our tomorrows. Today, Prime Minister Albanese delivered the seventeenth Closing the Gap speech. As he said, there is much work to be done, but I know that our nation's future will always be brighter when truly reconciled with our past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yeats says, 'Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart', but I know that our First Nations peoples are hopeful despite all. Most know how to hope without bitterness. When I was first a candidate, I remember a myopic prime minister who refused to say sorry. John Howard even accused those who spoke the truth of having a 'black armband view of history'. At least armbands let people see the future; a white blindfold shows them nothing. And where there is no vision, the people perish. What is right will always outlast the denial of our history. Fighting flags and other divisive culture wars are not the answer. This place doesn't need any more flag inspectors. There is serious work to be done in our nation, as the Prime Minister and the opposition leader detailed today. There is work to be done in our schools, in our workplaces, in our prisons and, most of all, in our hearts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in this, my final speech, I propose a word to sit alongside those first, big words like 'welcome' and 'sorry'. The word that I humbly offer is 'soon'. 'Soon' doesn't mean I seek another referendum or a vote on an advisory body. 'Soon' is simply to reassure all First Nations mob that the Labor Party won't ever forget you. I say 'soon' because we believe in a nation with justice and dignity at its core and 'soon' because Labor has a positive vision for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say 'soon' in the context of 100,000 years of history and the everywhen, that Indigenous concept of time where the past, present and future are all interconnected. Sometimes those opposite try to distract you from their perfidy; they weaponise our very democracy and the idea of a First Nations advisory body or makarrata or treaty. But hope and love will trump fear and division—soon. Right now, I'm proud to stand in front of that Murri flag. I don't want to obliterate 60,000 years of history; I want to celebrate it. I do so because I'm a patriotic Australian who knows our nation's history. No leader can prepare for the future if they're busy running from the past. One of those flags up there comes from Queensland, from the Torres Strait; that's a long way from here. Some people don't realise how big Queensland is or how far away the Torres Strait is. Queensland is larger than about 183 countries—and we're also weirder than 183 other countries, with respect! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first black feet ever to set foot on this continent did so in Queensland, about 5,000 generations ago—the first white foot too, a Dutch sailor, Willem Janszoon, in 1606, up near Weipa in Far North Queensland. And Queensland is where Lieutenant James Cook first raised his flag to claim present-day Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania for the British crown. We were nearly 60 years ahead of Fremantle and Hindmarsh claiming Western Australia and South Australia, respectively. My point is that Queensland is different. We know how to lead the way, like we did with Eddie Mabo and native title. Adversity helps us bend towards a greater truth. And despite the recent referendum result, I know that our Constitution—this little document—will eventually include our First Nations people. Our country needs the truth writ large rather than lies writ small. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Constitution, remember, was an act of the British parliament, passed by white British men with beards in Westminster. One day, soon, our Constitution will be amended by the modern men and women of Australia. I remind those opposite that every election day our nation divides. But it is not a tear. Tears are sometimes shed, but it is not a tear. Australian democracy is a zip, and at 6 pm, upon the counting of ballot boxes, the nation clicks right back together, irrespective of the results. Waging a fear campaign against this healthy democratic division is a failure to fundamentally understand Australians. We are much smarter politically than that. We're not scared of ballots or uncomfortable truths. In the Voice referendum, the coalition campaigned on 'vote no and get nothing', and that's exactly what they delivered. Of course, I respect the democratic decision of the public, because I'm passionate about democracy, and I believe in democracy. But I also believe in justice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Soon' in the context of 5,000 generations does not mean tomorrow, but soon is better than never. Soon we will have a reconciled nation; that change is going to come. I know this because 6,286,889 people voted yes on 14 October 2023. In Moreton, in my multicultural community, 49.32 per cent voted yes. In the 16 months since, there have been more 'yes' voters born and arriving, while 'no' voters are slowly but surely fading away. A change is going to come, not now but soon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're talking about changing this document—a constitutional change—the republican part of me requires some little placation. I will do that rather than talk about negative gearing or franking credits. I was at a citizenship ceremony in Brisbane in late November, standing next to a life-size portrait of King Charles III. I love citizenship ceremonies. They're the best part of my job as an MP. Normally, I do them with Lewis Lee, who's sitting up in the gallery there. But, standing there, as someone who had Queen Elizabeth on the English throne for 57 years, I realised that there's only space for one monarch in Queensland, and my one true king will always be Wally Lewis. A change is going to come. When Arthur Phillip arrived in Sydney Harbour with 11 ships filled with convicts, it was only five years after the American War of Independence and just 18 months before the French revolution kicked off—that Sydney Cove experiment sandwiched between crucial revolutions, with fervour for change, and dangerous ideas like freedom and equality bookending our convict chains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eventually, the United States would help deliver our 'Washminster' system of government, where we have senators not lords—except you, Murray, obviously! As 'Graham Perret', I think our nation also has a debt to the French and their notion of liberty, egality and fraternity. There are so many reasons to be a republic, including the one million Australians with Chinese links or the million Indian Australians, like my wife's family; the Afghan cameleers and Italians—even the Italians' Prime Minister—the Germans and Vietnamese; the Koreans, Somalis and Sudanese; and all those other connections that make our nation the tastiest salad on earth. Tony Burke told me 20 years ago that, unlike melting pots, salads protect the individual flavours of all ingredients. And salads are healthier, too, apparently. My Italian, Irish and French tangled roots don't define the tree; Australian soil lets each tree grow its own way. So I refuse to believe that no Australian is good enough to be our head of state. It won't ever be easy to change this document. I know that. But the harder fought the better won.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it has been a while, but after three words—'welcome', 'sorry' and 'soon'—I now turn to some thanks. I start with my wife, Lea, the woman who talked me into joining the Labor Party because she was sick of me whinging about John Howard. Thanks for putting up with me, Lea, through thick and thin—not as thin as you would like, but still. At the class of '07 baby-MP talk, we were told that 85 per cent of federal marriages fail due to long periods away from home, too many drinks and night-time shenanigans. Sadly, I've missed all of that—although once, late at night in Manuka, Darren Chester did offer me a lift home! We'll never know how things might've worked out, Darren!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seriously, Lea, I'm the luckiest bloke in the world to avoid that 85 per cent. It helps that I started with a wife who's smart, tough and funny, and a delicious dollop of beautiful as well. Thanks for raising our wonderful boys—Stanley, who's at work, and Leo—while kicking off your own amazing legal career. At best, I was a part-time assistant. I remember once when the COMCAR pulled up into our driveway in Morooka after a fun week in Canberra—with Darren!—and you were pushing a kid's mattress out the upstairs window. Gracefully, you yelled out: 'Graham, hose the vomit off this mattress, and put it out in the sunshine, and get up here and help with your bloody kids!' Speaker, I'm just checking—Lea doesn't have a right of reply or anything, does she? Anyway, like every MP with young kids, I nearly got back in that COMCAR. But I didn't, because you're my big, big love and you taught me that even the running kind can learn how to stay. Lea, thanks also for reminding me constantly that I was a part of the Labor government that abolished the $5,000 baby bonus while you were pregnant with Leo! I look forward to us both being under the same roof rather than working 1,000 miles from home and 2,000 miles from each other. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stanley was here for my first speech. He was up in that top gallery, a babe in his mother's arms. He's now at work and uni, and his younger brother, Leo, is here today. They are both growing into fine young men who are caring and kind. Most men either try to live up to their father's expectations or attempt to make up for their failures. I'm certainly in the latter camp, but I do sometimes wonder what camp my boys will be in. I've heard many politicians say in their valedictory speeches that they're leaving to spend more time with their families. Well, I've checked with the Prime Minister—and Leo, that's not compulsory!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love you both very much, Stanley and Leo, and I look forward to watching where you put your oversized feet out in the world. Whatever paths you choose, remember the golden rules of our household: (1) be kind, (2) work hard and (3) vote Labor all your life. Also hello to my sisters, Kerry and Megan; you're both still nurrigar. Hi to my friends, Annie, Phyllida and Chris, who are listening in the United States. Go Eagles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of Queensland MPs in the 42nd Parliament were Labor—15 out of 29. Sadly, we let the nation down recently at the last election. There are four party leaders from Queensland, and I acknowledge two of them sitting here. Sadly, none of those four Queensland party leaders have a positive plan for our nation. It does look tough for Queensland Labor right now, but that is when my state's true character shines through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the late 1800s, when employers were crushing worker dissent, the shearers at Barcaldine formed a political party. Soon after, in 1899, Queensland delivered the first Labor government anywhere in the world. When Joh and his gerrymander were outlawing street protests and dissent in the seventies, the Saints responded by delivering punk to the world. Eddie Mabo's truth showed terra nullius to be a lie and then Paul Keating delivered native title to our nation. Some people think that north of the Tweed is a conservative state, but we actually have a radical heart. I know Queenslanders will come through at the next election, starting with Julie-Ann Campbell in Moreton and a few others around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be working hard to make sure that happens, as will the wonderful Labor volunteers in Moreton—</span>

                  </a>  Moreton, not Gorton. No. There are way too many people to mention, but I thank them for turning out at pre-poll and on election day, for doorknocking, for phone calls, for doing visibility and for chatting to friends and neighbours about the mighty Labor Party's positive plan for this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to all my campaign directors, Jo Justo, Karen Struthers, the fearless Ros McLennan, the always astute Terry Wood, Julie-Ann Campbell, and, finally, the woman who is the heart and soul of the progressive Labor party on the south side of Brisbane, my good friend Sasha Marin, who is sitting in the advisers' block. In my opinion, Sasha's the best thing to ever come out of Lightning Ridge, and that includes opals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was first elected, there was no NBN or NDIS, schools weren't fairly funded and the perils of climate change were largely being ignored. I'm proud that Labor provided Australians with high-speed internet access, Labor created the world-first disability insurance scheme, we are implementing the Gonski education reforms, we introduced Commonwealth paid parental leave and Labor enshrined net zero emissions by 2050—and I could go on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All those reforms are due to Moreton volunteers like Alannah, Sasha and others like them, led by Ros, Sasha and Terry. Thank you all. In every one of my campaigns, I've received great assistance from the trade union movement. From the CFMEU, the UWU, the meaties, the QTU, the QIEU—my union—but especially Rohan, Anne Marie, Angus and the others at the amazing AMWU. Thank you, comrades, one and all. The unity of labour is the hope of the world. It was true in Barcaldine back in 1891, and it's still true today, while political parties trot out leaders who masquerade as hard men and friends of the poor.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I'm proud to be on the side of the workers. I believe the Labor party is the political wing of the union movement. If we ever lose this core purpose, we will be set adrift. I've seen up close what happens to a party when it is led by a soulless shapeshifter with no moral core. That way destruction lies. Labor must keep union values in our heart and our industrial comrades right alongside. This combination can achieve a fairer Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The modern union movement looks like modern Australia: people like Sally McManus, Michele O'Neil, Wendy Streets—who I think is in the gallery—and Ged Kearney, to name just a few. They're the modern unionists. And I give a special shout-out to the class of 2000 organising work graduates—there's one and there's another—Mary Doyle and Senator Lisa Darmanin. Three from the one class in federal parliament must surely be a record. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech I talked about bringing a bit more poetry into parliament.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't always been as kind as I could nor as courageous as I needed to be, but I've done my best. So, to all of my staff past and present, who have put up with my lack of kindness and/or courage, I say, 'Thank you,' especially to Sasha Marin, my chief of staff; Lee Lunney; Michelle Howe, who's also sitting over in the advisers box; Isaac Cavanagh, also over in the box—don't you have work to do, you three?—and Peter Shaw, who has been with me for 18 years and, in that time, has never once laughed at my jokes! </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Kane, Kylie, Kate, Norma, Matt, Michelle, Sarah, Ben, Jen, Sandy and Angus, and so many other wonderful people: thanks for looking after the light on the hill in Moreton. I know that Jules Campbell will tend the same flame with a little bit of help from you, not because we ask you to but because you feel you must, because you all believe in providing kindness during another's trouble. So thank you all. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all the MPs and senators who've helped out in Moreton over the years, especially Tanya Plibersek, Mark Dreyfus, Brendan O'Connor, Penny Wong and Murray Watt, for their friendship, guidance and good humour. To my good friend and neighbour Jim Chalmers: I still vividly recall all the doors we've knocked on together and the good times we've had at the Sunnybank tavern after eating way too much at the Landmark. Thank you, Jim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to you too, Mr Speaker, for the many events we've shared, and also to Senator Anthony Chisholm—who I'm not sure is here—who when he was state secretary was prepared to take on organised motorcycle gangs and their supporters in Moreton. You ask him about it. That was during that most difficult of elections in 2013 when Labor lost 17 seats, but in Moreton we actually received a swing to me. Thanks, Chis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all the voters in Moreton who were prepared to support Labor throughout the last seven elections, I say thank you. All MPs think their electorates are special, but multicultural Moreton really is. The word 'privilege' is thrown around a lot, but I do feel privileged to have represented all my different communities. I'm proud of how we work together, how we've taken the time to listen to each other's points of view and how we've learnt from each other—how we share cultural and religious celebrations and stay connected despite our differences. This occurs because of the generosity of people like Lewis Lee OAM, who's up in the gallery next to Jocelyn. I'm well paid to do my job, but Lewis is a volunteer, as his lovely wife, Jocelyn, can attest. Lewis leads by example. He has managed 61 citizenship ceremonies and fosters important community connections by promoting and attending cross-cultural events. Our country needs more people like Lewis. They are the glue that holds us together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And to those who could never bring themselves to vote for me: I can't tell you how much I appreciated working for you, despite having parliamentary privilege!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many great friends and good comrades in the Moreton community and the Labor caucus. There are too many good people to mention, so it would be easier if I only mention the bad ones! You're first, Rob Mitchell—no, just kidding! Where's Josh Wilson, who flogged me at tennis again this morning? It's especially lucky that my good friend Nick Champion has left the parliament, but I take this opportunity to mention that, despite a once furious media report to the contrary, I always beat Nick Champion when we played squash. On several occasions, the gymnasium staff asked us to stop swearing loudly, and I assert that all the foul language was exclusively Nick Champion's!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In another class of '07 valedictory speech, Bill Shorten tabled a list of all of his 192 staff to avoid reading them all into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. So, in a similar spirit, I table the names of all the people I've injured on the football, rugby, touch football, basketball and netball courts by playing too enthusiastically—your name's on there, Ed; don't worry! So I'll table that. But, to be fair, 28 of the names on this list are Keith Wolahan's! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do particularly thank Andy Turnbull for making so much sporting diplomacy and cross-party friendship possible in this place. Sport is a great way to make unusual friendships and international connections that are useful for this nation. Those contacts all help lubricate the gears of our wonderful democracy. Early morning sport also gets you into bed early, because nothing good happens in Canberra after midnight, and I say that with all respect to Darren Chester!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to all the co-chairs of the parliamentary friendship groups I've been involved with over the last 18 years. I have enjoyed working with Rowan Ramsey, Ken Wyatt and Judi Moylan to fight diabetes. Similarly, I have enjoyed championing the Red Cross, Amnesty, anti death penalty, support for Palestine, education and arts groups—especially arts groups—and several countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The diplomats and lobbyists who work in Canberra to ensure that politicians are better informed do a good job. Declared, registered lobbyists can make for better policy decisions. As long as there is no secrecy, I believe that they are an important part of this fragile, beautiful thing called democracy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I especially want to mention the Parliamentary Friends of LGBTQIA+ Australians group that I helped form with Warren Entsch and Senator Sarah Hanson-Young a long time ago. I know it's in good hands. But, with my good friend and comrade Louise Pratt and Warren leaving soon, I am concerned that the 48th Parliament might not be ready for the US-style attacks directed at the trans community. In Queensland, in fact, some might say those attacks are already here. Bullies and fascists always seek small groups to target. They are not alone in seeking out the trans community in this way, trying to turn real people into an 'other'. Remember that Jesus Christ is no weathervane. He loves all people always, not some people sometimes. He loves they and them and even you. If some politicians have become obsessed with how kids go to the loo, maybe it is time to leave the cult and go see a therapist. Dehumanising due to differences is a pathway to hell. It hollows out communities wherever it occurs, everywhere from Yeppen to Yeppoon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes bathrooms, pronouns and flags are merely political dead cats to distract from 34 criminal indictments or a nuclear policy with all the structural integrity of wet cardboard. Nevertheless, such attacks can be dangerous for people. An ABS study found that nearly thirty per cent of trans Australians have experienced suicidal thoughts. Suicidal ideation due to gender dysphoria is real. The coalition held a royal commission into the Home Insulation Program following the deaths of four young workers. So I am placing you all on notice right now: if you let politicians determine private health matters, kids will die. The young trans community needs kindness, courage and champions working for them right here under the big flag, because this building belongs to all Australians. Good people don't ever let bullies win elections by targeting the vulnerable. I know that the Parliamentary Friends of LGBTQIA+ Australians will never let caring become a crime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has also been an honour to work with all—actually, not all but nearly all—of the chairs and deputy chairs of the parliamentary committees I've been on. I did name that person, but my office said to take it out! Good committees where there is respect and professionalism are an essential part of this parliament, essential for policy and friendships and the strange links that glue this building together, glue that is needed in the hard times of politics. I spent way too much time with Keith Pitt in this the 47th parliament, also the late Kevin Andrews dealing with family law reform in the 46th Parliament and Karen Andrews in the 45th Parliament. But all effective committees bond over doing the right thing for this nation. My Liberal, National, Greens and Independent colleagues have all been passionate about their communities and their policies, and I have always respected their contributions, despite the fact they were usually wrong—no, just kidding! Nevertheless, thank you for your contributions, for your professionalism and for your friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Committees don't function without their secretariats, so thank you to all those helpful people who are behind the scenes. They make it all work. There are a lot of them in this building. I think my friends Anna and Siobhan are in the building somewhere at the moment. Yes, there they are. And I thank all the librarians, Hansard and all the rest who make this place very easy for politicians to work in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give a special thanks to the Leader of the House in his capacity as leader of the band. Thanks for inviting me into Left Right Out. I have had an absolute blast. Finally, we did our own original song last Tuesday. I will leave it to the Leader of the House to reveal when it's coming out. Playing with the Wiggles in the Great Hall was a highlight and playing for the Pharmacy Guild in the same venue—and that gig cost Mark Butler only $26.5 billion over five years. Gigs with some of my rock heroes like Mark Callaghan and Buzz Bidstrup were amazing, but truly not as much fun as jamming here on a Tuesday night. Thank you for the music and friendship, and I look forward to buying that single.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank John, Brendan, Sharon and Brenden from my old band Once I Killed a Gopher with a Stick—yes, that's their name—for doing fundraising gigs every three years for me since 2004.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the men and women of the press gallery, who I've always seen as an essential part of a healthy democracy, I don't think any other parliament in the world has put the press inside the building, complicit in this precious grand project called democracy. Obviously, that means you must do so much more than provide space in a Harvey Norman catalogue. Unfortunately for me, you've always accurately reported what I said, which has been the source of half my troubles!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the media business model changes, I wish you all the best in your devotion to truth. And now that the news and social media are polarised by design, some monsters are skilfully and ruthlessly exploiting fear and ignorance. The consent of the governed is harder to corral, and more and more journalists are being killed in the line of duty or arrested or sued for just doing their job. Nevertheless, the job of a good journalist, like a good politician, is to seek the truth and make it known.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so, in this cold, hard, complicated post-truth world I hope the honour in journalism continues to provide you all with purpose rather than inconvenience—and clicks and paid subscribers too, because good journalism costs money. Unfortunately, so does bad journalism, but that's a whole other problem for Rupert and Lachlan. May you never be deserted by the muse and anonymous sources. And if you ever run out of former politicians prepared to comment on the politics of the day, don't ever phone me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister, I want to thank you for many things. They say in life that you should never meet your heroes, but, Prime Minister, thanks for introducing me to your friend Billy Bragg, who is even better in person. And thanks for the Kessels Road and Mains Road and the Coopers Plains overpass—just half-a-billion dollars or so. Thank you for being a good friend to Moreton and a good friend to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you especially to foreign minister Penny Wong for facilitating the release, with you, Prime Minister, of Scott Rush and the remainder of the Bali Nine. I thought I'd be leaving this place with that as unfinished business. Instead, Scott had his first Christmas in 20 years with his parents, Lee and Chris, in Graceville.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've enjoyed the work of the Brisbane Olympics and Paralympics Games committee with Minister Wells. There have been some challenges with both the professional parties of protest in my state campaigning against the games, but we will get there. I look forward to Queensland and Australia putting on the best games ever in 2032.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And mainly, Prime Minister, thank you for being a steadfast leader, the sort who makes a promise and keeps it. I've loved seeing family law and education policies that I was involved with developing in opposition now Australian law and practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the parties of protest become louder, while the walking jeremiad and his echo acolytes become more shrill, I take great comfort from seeing a Prime Minister focused on delivery. And while the coalescence of whingers on the fringes gets louder, I know you will steer our nation on a sensible, egalitarian path towards sustainable prosperity. There's a quote I love in your mentor Tom Uren's autobiography <span style="font-style:italic;">Straight Left</span>:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We consider it a moral obligation of the fit to look after the sick, of the young to look after the old, and of the rich to look after the poor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good platform for any re-election campaign, and I know the wind is swinging in behind Labor as the fourth quarter gets willing, so good luck.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I note that when I made my first speech in 2008 my long-separated mother and father were in the gallery sitting together. They're both gone now. You're young and then you're not. Mum's been gone for over a decade, but I still associate her with Canberra, probably because I always found the time to call her when I was away from my own family. Peggy Perrett always gave me good advice, especially after she passed away. She was a strong guide, and I hope I always made you proud, Mum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see my brother Simon and his partner, Michael—with a beard to rival Dan's!—up in the gallery. They were here in 2008. I'm glad that there are some things in this world that have not changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This can be a hard place to maintain your pride. I've seen politics land blows on all sorts of people. It's a tough place for those who come here seeking some work of dignity and noble purpose. As a species, we do have that capacity for infinite kindness and infinite cruelty, but the everyday people of Moreton lean heavily towards kindness. And the poorer they are, the more kind and generous they seem to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must, through times of disagreement, remain focused on bringing people together. As I said in my first speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I wish to remind all Australians that the price of harmony is hard work. Each and every one of us must be eternally vigilant when it comes to community relations. We must knock on all our neighbours' doors and offer a helping hand. We must build understanding, trust and friendship, irrespective of race, religion, age or political beliefs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So if you are a representative of the Australian people and you exploit conflicts overseas to stoke fear and tension and divide people, then hopefully you will have no place here. Labor will continue to fight against racial and religious vilification and those who use division for political gain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They say the only thing you can count on in politics is your fingers. I had just turned 42 when the 42nd parliament started, and I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then, but now here in the 47th parliament, as a 47-year-old, I've come to the end of the best job in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are always more dogs than bones in the world of politics and I was never great at snarling, howling or learning to work with wolves, but I've enjoyed it. There comes a time for a bit of contemplation, as the early promise of life melts into later regrets. I'm so thankful to the mighty Labor Party for gifting me some sense of completion, almost satisfaction—not quite, obviously, because the work of equity and freedom is never done. But thank you all for letting me help our wonderful cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some say politics is a grubby crawl towards noble things that you never see, but I've seen plenty of good in this place. I'm looking at it now. We only get one wild and precious life so we must find some usefulness, and the big purpose of every life is little kindnesses. I hope to distribute some more kindnesses in a different place. It really has been an excellent adventure and I love youse all. So after 'welcome', 'sorry', 'soon' and 'thanks', I'd like to make my final words in here a bit of poetry from the always pithy Dorothy Parker:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:50</span>):  on indulgence—In his first speech in this place the member for Moreton promised to bring some poetry and literature back to the chamber, and in his final speech he's done both; Graham has certainly held to that commitment. I'm sure all members would agree that, whatever the issue is before the House, it's always worth listening to the member for Moreton's contributions to debate both for their substance and the way they are presented with humour, insight and, importantly, heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Graham has been an extraordinary colleague for a long period of time. He has friendships, quite clearly, across the chamber. Some, as we've learned today—with Darren Chester—are closer than we know about; I'll leave that to those two to deal with!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever you visit Graham's electorate of Moreton, two things come across. One is his pride in his community and everything he's worked to deliver over 18 years as an MP. I reckon my visits to Moreton are probably up to around 30 or 40 at least—everything from multicultural events to Mains and Kessels, which is the most expensive overpass anywhere in Australia, it's got to be said: more than $300 million on an intersection! Graham was absolutely determined to do that, and it has unclogged that part of Brisbane. It was a real investment. We went through the processes and found that, bizarrely, it did stack up in terms of productivity and the difference it would make. That was just one of the many projects Graham advocated for in the electorate, from level crossings to a range of infrastructure projects to community infrastructure projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that you notice about Graham—I'm not sure of the name of the shopping centre in Sunnybank—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ALBANESE:</span>
                  </a>  Sunnybank Plaza. We did a walk through that shopping centre. I'm someone who does that. Some people would advise against doing this sort of activity but I do it because it's the only way that you actually get engagement with people that is not pre-planned. Going through that shopping centre with Graham on at least two occasions, there were two things I noticed. One was the people he knew, which was a lot of them; that showed a member in touch. The second was the genuine warmth, engagement, interaction and respect that he had with the people he didn't know. Whether they were raising issues that were easy to solve or whether they were raising problems to be dealt with, Graham dealt with them in exactly the same way—respectfully and with courtesy, and aiming to do, if he could, what he could for them. Where he couldn't because of differences where he thought the issue they were raising was not one that he supported, he'd tell them up front. We did multiple multicultural round tables in that very diverse electorate as well. I'd get regular reports from my first cousin Helen, who lived in Sunnybank, about Graham's effort as a member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about Moreton is that Graham won the seat off the Liberal Party and held it. It has been a marginal seat for all that time, and he has extended the margin out over a period of years. When we launched Julie-Ann Campbell's campaign for Moreton the Perrett army was there, transferred over to work for Jules. No doubt she will follow Graham as the member for Moreton and will do a fantastic job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was some misinformation out there from the media as well about Graham's preselection. I want to put this on the record. I went to Graham and said, 'Mate, if you want to run again, you're absolutely in.' He was like: 'I'm done. I've made my contribution. It's time.' He came to that decision himself, and I respected that, even though I was disappointed. But he also did something that not everyone in this place does: he lined up a fantastic successor in that electorate who can carry on his legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Lea, thank you for what you've given up as well. Thank you for lending us your hubby for such a long period of time. And to Stanley and Leo—I think a definition of good parenting is defined by the fact that Stanley is a South Sydney fanatic. That shows good parenting, particularly given Graham's St George—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Perrett:</span>
                  </a>  He knows a Dragons supporter!</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  That deserves compassion because it's been a hard time and it's going to get worse as it goes on! To the family—I've been to Graham's home on a number of occasions, and watching the boys grow up has been a great privilege as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will miss your company here, but we will treasure your friendship forever. I've never seen anyone more excited than when he got to meet Billy Bragg, in his dressing room, and insisted on a thousand photos with Billy Bragg. I look forward to ongoing friendship and engagement with you, mate, and look forward to catching up for a beer after the election.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  I just want to congratulate the member for Moreton for his lovely speech. We'll have a lot to say to each other afterwards.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been almost 23 years to the day since I rose in this very chamber to make my very first parliamentary speech. In fact, I was sitting on the other side; I was trying to locate where exactly, but I don't remember. In that speech, I recall that I spoke largely about the nature of the community I would represent and serve in this place. In that first speech, I said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Multiculturalism is one of the modern foundations of our nation. It is one of our proudest achievements. Nowhere is this more evident than in the electorate of Calwell where two-thirds of residents are either first or second generation Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 23 years, there have been many challenges to multiculturalism. It is a fact that external events, international developments, have had a profound impact on Australia's social fabric, testing the resolve of our multiculturalism from both a national security and a social cohesion perspective. And, of course, I'll say a bit more about that after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, first, it wasn't always my plan to be a member of parliament, and I certainly never really intended to stay this long, but I'm proud to be the first Greek-born woman to enter Australia's federal parliament. I'm also proud of all that we—my staff, my community, my constituency and my colleagues from all sides in this place—have achieved together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had always been interested in politics, but I never aspired to be a politician. I officially joined the Labor Party in 1982, but my very first foray into active politics dates back to 1975, when I was a very enthusiastic year 11 student of politics at Princes Hill high school. With the dismissal of the Whitlam Labor government, 1975 was a very intense time for Australian politics. In fact, the entire seventies were a time of change and reform. The establishment of multiculturalism as a social policy was by far one of the greatest reforms in modern Australian history. My interest in politics and the drama of 1975 led me to the Victorian Trades Hall Council, and I ended up working with the Migrant Workers Committee that had been established to re-elect the Labor government. The people I met there, people such as George Zangalis, Christos Tsirkas—my friend and mentor—Theo Sidiropoulos, Giovanni Sgro and others, were incredible role models who taught me a great deal about the passion of politics, its capacity for empowerment and change, and the art of campaigning. I also remember meeting prominent feminist Germaine Greer when she came to speak at Trades Hall. I was 16 and absolutely in awe of her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went on to study arts and then a diploma of education at the University of Melbourne before I went on to teach at Thornbury High School. I spent two years coordinating the Greek Festival, which was the predecessor of today's Antipodes festival, Melbourne's largest street party, and I'm sure some of you will be attending that in a few weeks time. When I decided to leave teaching in 1987, I applied for two jobs. One was as an electorate officer in the office of the former member for Calwell Andrew Theophanous, and the other was with the Red Cross blood bank. I was offered both jobs but Andrew offered me the job first, and I accepted. I often wonder what might have happened or what could have been if the Red Cross had got in first.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor adopted affirmative action quotas in 1994, and when the opportunity to stand for preselection in a federal seat came up, I was encouraged to throw my hat in the ring, despite some reluctance on my part. At that stage, I had two young children, Stavros and Stella, and the thought of coming to Canberra weighed heavily on me. My husband and family and, indeed, my comrades in the Labor Party, especially my good friend former senator Kim Carr, urged and encouraged me to run. So despite my reservations, I stepped up.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2001 election campaign proved to be a very difficult one. It was the election of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa </span>and the SIEV X, and it was two months after the horror of September 11 and the beginning of the war on terror. I was standing for a seat that had one of Australia's largest concentrations of residents who observe the Muslim faith—in excess of 15 per cent. It was home also to one of the largest concentrations of Turkish-born and Turkish-identifying Australians, who started arriving here in large numbers after the White Australia policy was officially axed in 1967. Today, the number of constituents of the Muslim faith in Calwell stands in excess of 25 per cent. It was also home to many migrants of Lebanese heritage. They were part of a broader community of postwar migrants from Greece, Italy, Scotland, Ireland, Croatia, Serbia and Malta as well as the more recently arrived refugee communities from Iraq and later Syria. Now, there is a growing number of residents from India, Pakistan, Bhutan and Nepal.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Calwell is also the home of the original inhabitants of the Wurundjeri and Marinbulluk clans of the Woiwurrung tribe. The matter of ultimate recognition and reconciliation with our Indigenous Australians is still outstanding. Whatever form reconciliation takes the future, it will be the role of this place to decide in consultation and partnership with the Indigenous and broader community what that looks like.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a migrant myself, I share a common story with my local communities, and this experience has been critical to my ability to represent them in this place. I would often be asked both here and abroad how it is that a person of Greek heritage could be supported by migrants of Turkish heritage. The answer has always been simple—that, as an Australian, I live in a multicultural country where waves of generations of migrants have settled with a common purpose. It is our shared migrant experiences that bind us as Australians and outweigh the polarised divisions emanating from the original homelands.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to Arthur Calwell, Australia's first immigration minister, and credit him and the Labor government of the time for seizing the opportunity to lay the foundations for modern Australia. In fact, Calwell—and even though the term was not used at that time—can be considered the father of multicultural Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2001, 9/11 and the Tampa incident tested our nation on how we managed our borders and our sovereignty. They also tested multiculturalism in Australia. On 12 September 2001, the day after 9/11, my constituents of Turkish, Lebanese and Arabic heritage suddenly found themselves defined only by their faith as Muslims, and, to many, they were suddenly seen as a threat. In fact, I remember visiting a constituent in Broadmeadows at their home, and, just as I was leaving, with some hesitation, they asked me if they should be concerned about their next-door neighbours, whom they had known for 20 years and had always thought of as wonderful people. Their neighbours were Muslim, of Turkish heritage. I reassured them that they would have more chance of being hit by a car walking to Broadmeadows shopping centre than of their neighbours causing them any harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was to be the beginning of dramatic changes in mainstream perceptions of and views about multicultural Australia. At the heart of these changing attitudes was fear and loathing amongst some elements of the Australian community towards fellow Australians of Muslim faith. This affected in particular Muslim women and young people, who had to endure racist taunts, innuendos, attacks and endless allegations and suspicions about their loyalties to Australia and doubts about whether their Muslim faith and their values would allow them to integrate and adapt successfully into the broader community. It was feared by some that Islam was not a religion of peace and that we were facing, in this country, the imposition of Sharia law.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My local council, under the leadership of the late Gary Jungwirth, who was mayor at the time, had already put in place, before 11 September 2001, the Hume City Council's interfaith network. Gary's commitment to social justice and belief in multicultural Australia led him to form a social justice charter, in addition to the interfaith network. He was a visionary councillor and served the Hume City Council with distinction. The interfaith network represented a diversity of religious faiths, with Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs participating, and of course I was honoured to be its inaugural chair. We were able to hit the ground running, and our local faith leaders led the way in building bridges and fostering understanding between our local faith communities by encouraging tolerance, urging restraint and calling for dialogue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the highly charged atmosphere of Tampa and September 11, we all understood what lay ahead for our local community of Muslim faith. You see, from this time forward, some in the political class, the media and the national security agencies began to define identity and refer to migrants and refugees in terms of their faith rather than their ethnic or linguistic heritage, and Islam itself was under relentless scrutiny; so were those who identified with Islam. Suddenly, multiculturalism became a matter of national security. We began to police the integration process, because it wasn't about nation-building now; it was about terrorism, hotlines and being on alert for foreign interference and homegrown terrorism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I don't want to downgrade the concerns or the threats, but I've always rejected the takeover of multiculturalism policy by the security agencies. Sure, they have a job to do: protecting Australians from credible threats from wherever they emanate. But we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. We are better than that. Here the media has a grave responsibility in how it portrays, amplifies and perpetuates a view not based necessarily on facts but on opinion, thus becoming, knowingly or unknowingly, accommodators of prejudice, hate and division.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to those faith leaders, such as the late Yasser Solomon, a local constituent and friend, who, at the time, was President of the Islamic Council of Victoria and worked hard to convey the true meaning and practices of Islam. Others included Father Malcolm Holmes from the Uniting Church in Broadmeadows; the then imam<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>of the Broadmeadows Turkish mosque, Imam Younis Jan; and the late Sheik Famini Imam, leader of the Arabic-Muslim community in Victoria.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I reflect on the last two decades, I realise that a whole new generation of young people have grown up under the shadow of September 11 and the war on terror. I can say that many young people in my community endured challenges to their identity as Australians and as followers of the Muslim faith, and all because of the external events which were very much beyond their control. Despite this, they have risen to the occasion, and they have succeeded.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was education that transformed and enabled my generation, and it's education that has seen my local young people of Muslim faith excel and contribute in a variety of positive ways. I want to pay homage to a dear friend, the late Ibrahim Dellal, a true teacher and a wise man. He was an Australian of Turkish Cypriot background who led the way in supporting and nurturing young people of Muslim faith by providing educational opportunities, because he knew this was the path, and the only path, to success and contribution. I worked with Ibrahim in my first term as he set up one of the first non-government Muslim schools, known then as ISIK College. Many more have subsequently followed not only in my electorate but in electorates across the country. In my electorate I note the dedication and commitment of the teachers of both Ilim College and Sirius College. I have enjoyed the many visits to these schools and witnessed firsthand their academic excellence and community spirit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ironically, I stand here today in the wake of continuing destruction, tensions and conflict following the terrible events of October 7 2023 and the subsequent Israeli assaults on Gaza and Lebanon. Once again, we are facing challenges to multiculturalism, concerns about the fraying of social cohesion and a diminished capacity for community dialogue. It is often said that different migrant communities should not bring their troubles and conflicts to Australia. This is a naive view. It is inevitable that communities with histories and families in other parts of the world will feel passionately about conflicts and catastrophes that take place in their original homelands. It is an affinity, a connection, that we should not reject but understand and even utilise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We Australians in general have an interest in, and opinions about, world affairs. We also have an affinity as a middle moderate power, especially but not exclusively from the Labor tradition, of being peacemakers, problem solvers and conflict resolution internationalists. Resolving conflicts and mitigating differences is never easy. There is never complete clarity about who is right and wrong, especially in contexts where they are sourced overseas and out of reach or our influence is inconsequential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People shouting at each other in the streets is not what multiculturalism is about. I reject the notion that multiculturalism is a failure and a liability because of some of the ugliness that we have witnessed recently and throughout the post-9/11 period. The important point is that we must work to ensure that such issues and differing opinions are not used as political weapons to further divide people. That is what threatens our social cohesion. Social cohesion is not about everyone agreeing. It is not about wanting everyone to become devoid of opinion, passion or difference. It's about working to build dialogue, civilised debate and a respectful society within which people can express their views and, where possible, work for common, beneficial outcomes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 23 years, I've represented communities that carry with them historical, ancestral, protracted and ongoing differences. Working with them in a constructive and respectful manner has helped achieve many significant outcomes—outcomes that could only happen in this country and can only happen because of our multicultural ethos and demeanour.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A great example of the sort of mediation and facilitation I'm talking about is on an issue that is very close to my heart—the reunification of Cyprus. I acknowledge the presence of the High Commissioner for Cyprus, Mr Antonis Sammoutis, who is in the gallery. A small intervention of what can be achieved was set by two Australian men, one of Turkish Cypriot background, Yalcin Adal; and the other of Greek Cypriot background, Stavros Protz, who, together, walked across the length of Cyprus for 16 days in 2018—'from east to west', they called it. Theirs was a mission of peace, reconciliation and healing to a still divided island. I pay tribute to my friends Yalcin and Stavros for their courage and humanity. I was honoured to be involved in their campaign when they both came to Canberra to meet with then senator Pat Dodson. They asked him where they could source a native tree to plant at the end of their journey in Cyprus, which they did. I also pay tribute to my constituents and friends Peter Minas and Tumer Mimi, Greek and Turkish Cypriots who have worked with us over the years to promote rapprochement between the two communities both here and in Cyprus. Our rapprochement work saw me become the first Australian MP to cross the border into the north of Cyprus in 2002 to visit my husband's home, Agios Epiktitos, in the northern part of Cyprus, that he fled in 1974, and to visit Greek and Turkish Cypriots who were and still are seeking a way forward to reunite the island. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Rudd-Gillard Labor governments that officially supported the Cyprus Academic Dialogue that sought to give Australia a practical role to play in building capacity for peace and resolution through the network of academics and civil society. I credit my husband, Dr Michalis Michael, for pursuing this important initiative through his work with the then Centre for Dialogue at La Trobe University. By partnering with Greek and Turkish Cypriot counterparts, both here and in Cyprus, we were able to establish an ongoing collaboration where civil society took a lead in dealing with the complexity of issues. It's a fine example of Australia's citizen diplomacy. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was followed more recently with the Famagusta Dialogues that involved the local municipalities. Here our peace-making, middle-power, internationalist disposition, combined with our multicultural ethos and access to diasporas, enabled Australia to mount these second-track peace dialogues. To sustain them, and hopefully others like them, they need support and resources. As with foreign aid, they are but a fraction of what one item of military hardware costs. It's a worthwhile investment in peace. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My advocacy for Palestinian self-determination is well known. It has always been about supporting the right of the Palestinian people to determine their future through their own statehood. I have visited the region on many occasions and I've worked with both Palestinians and Israelis over the years with a shared common purpose. I want to thank the former ambassador for the General Delegation of Palestine, Dr Izzat Abdulhadi, for his friendship and advice over the years. I also want to thank APAN, which I've worked with over the years, and also my very good friend Wendy Turner, who would be known to many of us in this place. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially during the last year, has caused major disruption and angst both here in Australia and elsewhere in the world. It remains an outstanding issue that needs an amicable solution—one that is just and one that brings peace, stability, prosperity and security not only to the region but also, importantly, to Palestinians and Israelis. My support for the Palestinian people and Palestinian statehood does not preclude my support and hope for peace, security and prosperity for Israel. I've been critical of the State of Israel over the years, as anyone and everyone who believes in human rights and international law should be, but I have a great affection for the Jewish people, and the current wave of antisemitism in our country is of great concern to me. The horrors of civilian deaths in Gaza and the destruction of Gaza cannot go unnoticed, and it begs outrage, and rightfully so. But we cannot ignore the extremities that are happening in our own community. These acts are conducted, as usual, by anonymous cowards who harbour dark intentions that have little to do with Palestine. Equally, those who seek to exploit antisemitism for their own interests should exercise restraint, responsibility and civil diligence, for they sow the seeds of hate and division. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When my family came to Australia in 1963, we settled in North Carlton. The inner suburbs of Melbourne were home to newly-arrived migrants—to Calwell's new Australians. Largely because of the textile, clothing, food and car factories, they were located there. The typical migrant story was to go where the work was and where families and communities were settling and forming. Carlton was where the first Jewish Holocaust survivors settled as refugees until they started to move out in the late 1960s and early seventies. It was Arthur Calwell who accepted the first ship of Jewish refugees to Australia when other countries wouldn't. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents worked in the local factories. My mother worked at the Ivan Porter shoe factory in Fitzroy, with many other migrants. She befriended a woman named Rosa. Rosa was a Polish Jew who had survived Auschwitz. They worked together in this factory and walked home together. When my mother first invited Rosa to our house, I was eight years old. I remember Rosa vividly to this day. My first impression was of a very highly strung woman. Today we would recognise this as post-traumatic stress disorder. My good friend—known to many of you—Paris Aristotle and his organisation, the Victorian Foundation of Survivors of Torture, or Foundation House, would have been able to render assistance. Mum spoke little English, so I had to be the interpreter. Rosa carried with her in her big purse photographs of her family members who had perished in the death camps. She carried 'the mark', as she called it—a numerical tattoo on her forearm—and she cried as she spoke of her dead family members. I had to translate all of this to my mum, but she understood anyway. She understood empathetically what was going on; she and Rosa didn't need to speak to each other in English.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents had experienced the German occupation of their village, Agios Petros, in Lefkada in the Ionian Islands. They were 10 years old when the war started. Agios Petros village sits at the back of the island, and the German command set up their communications stations at the top of the mountain just above the village. What is left of the ruins today are referred to by the locals as the 'German remains', and people don't really want to venture there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents, aunts and uncles often spoke of the brutality and cruelty of the German soldiers. They were terrified of them, and the German command made sure of this. They also spoke about the concentration camps, the gas chambers and the killing of Jews. As children, we would listen to these stories, and these experiences and memories were our family's legacy. It is what they and other post Second World War migrants brought with them to Australia. It is what more recently arrived refugees and migrants bring with them also. They shaped and influenced my generation's thinking, and they will do the same for current generations within the context of our multicultural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this period of post Second World War migration, it always struck me as incredible that my parents would finally meet the Jewish people they had heard about during the war, that they would live amongst them in Carlton and that they would work alongside them. My mother and Rosa shared the pain of lost homelands and loved ones, the experiences and memories of the devastation of the Second World War. My formative years were shaped by these stories and these people. I know they shaped and haunted my parents' generation and all those who endured the violence and devastation of World War II. I pay tribute to them all because they were all resilient. Australia gave them opportunity, safety and a new home. They embraced their life circumstances and became nation builders. We owe them a great debt. We owe them our modern Australia. We have a responsibility to honour and protect their legacy, and to follow their lead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Rosa has been in my thoughts constantly lately. The 85th anniversary of the Holocaust reminds us that we cannot ignore what is happening in our community at the moment. As parliamentarians, we can't just offload the challenges for others to deal with. We have to work here and within our own communities with genuine intent, and lead initiatives to lead people together.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk is cheap. Politicisation of conflict is dangerous. In the 23 years that I have sat in this parliament, the weaponisation of immigration, refugees and multiculturalism has not helped social cohesion; it has threatened it. I want to thank the member for Monash, who, in recognising these dangers, tag teamed with me to establish the Parliamentary Friends of Multiculturalism in 2015. Our purpose was to reaffirm the importance of multiculturalism and to encourage the restoration of bipartisan support. A SBS news item described us as 'the odd couple of federal politics' because we were on opposite sides of the political spectrum—one of Greek heritage; the other of British stock.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give the House an example of what a practical response to encourage social cohesion in our community looks like. I refer to an event I organised in partnership with the now member for Macnamara, Josh Burns, when he was a young staffer in this place. At Josh's initiative we held an event for progressive young Jewish and Arab people to come together as a way of breaking barriers and confronting stereotypes resulting from September 11. In November 2012, quite a while ago, we hosted an intercultural dialogue event at the Banksia Gardens Community Centre in Broadmeadows. We had two inspirational speakers. One was the Hon. Justice Emilios Kyrou AO, the first Greek-born judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria, who now heads the AAT. Emilios grew up in Broadmeadows and endured, like myself and others of our generation, the rejection and racism of the time. The other speaker was renowned author and activist Arnold Zable, himself a Jewish migrant, who, like me, attended Princes Hill high school; it is a good school, and quite a few notable people have been there. They both recounted their experience growing up as migrants, experiencing racism and being outsiders. Yet despite this they were able to rise beyond it all and become successful members of the Australian community. This event had a major impact on the young people in that room not just because the speakers themselves had walked in their shoes previously but, more importantly, because in that space on that day they were able to sit together—Jewish and Muslim youth in one place at the same time. Their paths would never have crossed otherwise. I thank Josh for this initiative and look forward to Josh being returned as the member for Macnamara in this place, as he has a very important contribution to make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This event helped convince me that it is our responsibility to lead the way. We have to make dialogue happen in a way that brings people together, especially those who have such entrenched views about each other. We can make a difference; 50-plus years of multicultural policy shows us the way. And now, 13 years later, we find ourselves in yet another crisis where old hatreds resurface and where we risk another generation of young people experiencing these fears and prejudices. We must do better if we are to protect and preserve social cohesion, and we can only do this through initiatives that encourage dialogue—not marketing or advertising it but actually conducting it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Multiculturalism is about much more than managing intercommunal tensions or focusing exclusively on immigration and refugees; it is a practical policy framework to ensure social inclusion and equal access to services and opportunities. One of the keys to access inclusion is language and communication. A prime example of what this might look like is the initiative during the Rudd Labor government to translate the instructions on the bowel cancer testing kits into multiple community languages. I approached the then health minister, the member for Sydney, to explain that one important reason for the low take-up rates of the free bowel cancer testing kits that we all receive in our letterboxes after turning 50 and thereafter was a lack of understanding, especially amongst communities whose first language was not English. She was very quick to respond by directing her department to rectify this. The information became available in multiple community languages, and for my part I continued to tell my constituents that when they turn 50 and go onwards—as I had at the time—the Australian government sends them a birthday present in the mail, and I advised them to open it and make use of it. I hope they did!</span>

                  </a>  I will! It was such an obvious but significant dissemination of the health department's information, with the potential to change and indeed save lives. This, surely, is the point of multicultural policy—to ensure that everyone has full access to information services and that everyone, regardless of language or culture, can fully participate in our society. This is the multiculturalism that I and so many others have fought for and will continue to fight for, despite the naysayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that all migrants should be given every opportunity to learn English, no doubt; they have to. But like my constituent and good friend the late Stefan Romaniw, I believe in the importance of supporting the retention of the teaching of community languages. Stefan, sadly, passed away last year. He will be greatly missed by the community languages sector whose advocacy he led, but he'll also be missed by the local Ukrainian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The retention of language is not only important to our diaspora communities; building multilingual capacity is a valuable resource and asset for Australia, especially so in our bilateral relations and interactions with the world and more so with our Asia-Pacific region. It was a significant achievement when the then education minister, Julia Gillard, developed the national school curriculum, which included community languages. The member for Adelaide and I carried into this place a petition of some 22,105 signatures supporting the inclusion of the Modern Greek language on the national school curriculum as a language of cultural, community, historical and economic importance to Australia and the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greek community is often held up as an example of successful integration. It is very much that. Its success is a result of multicultural policies and its own cultural and social resilience. My generation was encouraged to retain culture, language, faith and traditions while simultaneously proudly owning and bringing this inheritance along with us in our integration process. I hated going to Greek school. But I'm grateful that I was forced to by my parents, because today I'm bilingual and that is an asset. I can tell you one more thing: multiculturalism helped my generation—and I say this to a lot of schoolkids—deal with the double life we were living in our formative years, because it was a double life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Successful integration doesn't happen by chance. Multiculturalism has and will continue to enable the integration of migrants and assist their journey to becoming Australians. It will enable our newer, emerging communities who are coming here from our region with the same aspirations and desires to hold on to language and culture, and who are making and will make their contribution to the great Australian story, for they are the next wave of nation-builders.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw this last week, at the SBS television's celebration of Lunar New Year here in parliament. This event was hosted by SBS's friendship group—again, convened by the member for Monash, me and the member for Fowler—and it saw the member for Monash and me dress in the traditional garments of a Korean groom, which was quite fun. The acknowledgement of country was conducted in Korean—a poignant example of contemporary Australian multiculturalism in action. SBS is a vital piece of our multicultural infrastructure. It's in-language focus is critical to our nation, to our social inclusion and to our national security.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My passionate belief in multiculturalism is why, in this place, I have always sought to be a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. I have served on this committee over six or so parliamentary terms, both as chair and deputy chair. I'm especially proud of the committee's report <span style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry into migration and multiculturalism in Australia</span> from March 2013. This inquiry looked at the economic, social and cultural impacts of migration on Australia. It was, as I have said, an audit into migration and multiculturalism, following a decade of criticism and fear-mongering. Other reports followed, including <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> one teaches you to become an Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> and the most recent, <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">pathway to nation building. </span>These reports made many recommendations, but they also affirmed that, in general, Australians support multiculturalism and accept that we are a multicultural nation and that they also support migration as a nation-building enterprise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area of public policy that's been consistently close to my heart throughout my time here is health. I started off specifically taking an interest in support for people with cancer, and, even more specifically, breast cancer. My very first private member's business in this place was in 2002. It was about mammary prostheses. It called on this House to note the recommendations of the February 1995 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs to amend the Medicare rebate schedule to include provision of mammary prostheses. The report noted at that time, some 23 years ago, that women diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent mastectomies were forced to endure not only the emotional and physical stress of the disease itself but also the financial burden of breast prostheses. Many had to use crude, birdseed-filled prostheses, like the one my mother did, or they had to make do with reused prostheses from women who had died. This motion came about after I accepted a meeting with this amazing woman named Roz Hill, who herself had had breast cancer and a mastectomy. She led the Canberra based organisation Caring for You, and, together with the Melbourne based Breast Cancer Action Group, advocated for the Medicare rebate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke to my private member's motion, which was seconded at the time by my colleague the former member for Charlton the late Kelly Hoare, who had mentored me in my first term, I used a prop. As a former teacher, this seemed the best way to illustrate my point to the House. I demonstrated what a more sophisticated version of a breast prosthesis looked like and why it should be available to all women regardless of their financial status through the Medicare rebate. Its appearance startled and bemused the deputy speaker, who at the time was the dry witted former member for Scullin and later Speaker of the House, Harry Jenkins. The mammary prosthesis was a version of the real thing, and it caused Harry to pause for a moment—a very long moment. I eventually got the message that I should put it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also caused a flurry in the media across the country the next day. Everyone was outraged as the headlines screamed 'Birdseed in the bra' and 'Dead women's breast prostheses resold'. As a result of the public outrage, the then shadow minister for health Stephen Smith, although unable to implement the recommendations of the 1995 report to amend the Medicare schedule, did commit to provide a nationally funded dedicated breast prostheses program to public hospitals to ensure that funding went directly to the provision and availability of these prostheses. This was a commitment we implemented when we came to government in 2007. It proved to me that advocates could make a difference and influence policy in this place and in this room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went on to become good friends with Roz Hill, and she encouraged me to keep going over the years when I had doubts about staying. Roz was a two-time breast cancer survivor but sadly passed in 2015, almost 40 years after her first diagnosis. I spent many terms up here involved in raising awareness about breast cancer through the parliamentary friends of the breast cancer networks. My own mother died of it at 53 years of age. Her experience, and mine of losing her at a young age, devastated our family, and I know, as many of us do, the impact of such diseases on the individual, the family, the community and, of course, on the public resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Breast cancer support became the first of many other vital access areas of health that I have taken an active interest in. I believe strongly that everyone regardless of socioeconomic status or English-language capacity should have access to information and preventative screening programs that are designed for early detection and saving lives. Raising awareness on public health issues has been critical to my work. People and communities cannot flourish without good health, and, from an economic point of view, not only does screening programs, awareness raising and early detection programs save lives but also they're cost effective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also co-chaired the heart and stroke friendship group for many years, and I believe that friendship groups have a very important role to play in this place. I, like most of you, am on scores of them, and I particularly want to thank another wonderful woman, Tanya Hall from Hearts 4 Heart, for her advocacy and tenacity. My involvement in these groups has always been about how I can assist and better inform my local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the colleagues that I worked with to achieve the passing of the presumptive legislation that provides protection for firefighters. With the support of the Victorian United Firefighters Union secretary, Peter Marshall, I bypassed unwittingly my own caucus's internal processes, teamed up with the member from Melbourne and the member for Monash—there's a theme here—and secured tri-partisan support for this crucial bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 23 years, I have witnessed many changes in both of my workplaces—the main one being my electorate and the second one being here in this building. When I first came up here, there were far fewer female MPs. This place was very different. We sat longer hours. It was not uncommon to sit well into the early hours of the morning. I remember one time I was listed to speak at around 3 am on a particular bill and I had to stay awake only to discover that the bill was finally guillotined just before I was due to speak. This happened often in those days. I know it happens in the Senate more regularly but this is the House of Representatives, where government's formed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was first elected, my children were aged six and eight. Children were not accommodated for in these halls and members of parliament were expected to function in spite of rather than alongside being parents. With more women here, and both women and men of different ages and life stages, the culture has changed, and it's changed for the better. Sitting hours have become a lot more family friendly, and we actually have a childcare centre on site—something, believe it or not, that was vehemently rejected when this House was first planned and built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes have not only benefited women; they have meant that male colleagues have been more comfortable talking about their children, bringing them to Canberra and involving them in their working lives. I recall an incident, and there were many of them, in 1993—this is going back a while—when I was here as a staffer to former senator Kim Carr. He had his eight-month-old baby, Ruth, who he had to hand over to an attendant before entering the Senate for a division because 'strangers' were not allowed on the floor of the chamber. Of course, now it's much more common for members to bring their babies into the chamber. That makes a real difference to a lot of the women here but also a lot of the men. Admittedly, it took some years for these changes to evolve, and I'm sure they never would have happened without more women being elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased to note the increasing number of women from diverse cultural backgrounds being elected to parliament. It is very important for our migrant communities, both established and emerging, to see people like them in positions of representation, power and influence. Not only does it give them the courage and confidence to aspire to their own goals in public or community life; it helps to ensure that cultural nuance is more likely to become embedded in the making of public policy. In my inaugural speech I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… effective representation involves empowering the community you serve so that it can help itself. It will be my job and proud duty to share in this work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also said that it was especially important for recently arrived migrants, and, in particular, migrant women, to take up leadership roles where they can and make a real impact on decision-making for the benefit of our community. I'm pleased to say that there are many such women in my electorate today. They may not necessarily become members of parliament, but they are already leaders in my community. I have always found that approaching women in my communities is the most efficient and effective way of learning about the issues that matter most to people—to help spread awareness of, and access to, services for the people who need them the most. It's usually the women who understand the needs of families, children and the elderly. They are the ones who get the jobs done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I became an MP because I was always interested in being involved—or, as I often explained to school students, because I don't mind my own business. It's been gratifying, rewarding and sustaining to have met and worked with so many others who also don't mind their own business—many of them for no financial reward. I've met so many amazing people over the years, but I would like to highlight just a few of the extraordinary women from my electorate that I've had a privilege to work with.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll start with Nayana Bandari. She leads the Oorja Foundation, a community group she helped established to help the growing Indian community. Thank you, Nayana, for the wonderful work you do and for giving me the opportunity to be part of bringing to Australia the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Geeta</span>, an award-winning documentary about an acid attack survivor Geeta Mahor and her daughter, Neetu, and their fight against gender based violence. We showed this film in the Parliament House theatre. I want to thank its director and producer, Emma Macey-Storch, for her amazing work in helping to make arrangements for Neetu to give evidence by phone from India to the Human Rights Subcommittee inquiry into violence against women and girls.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maria Liistro approached me many years ago to help her persuade a hospital to give her 13-year-old son, Sammy-Joe, life-saving treatment for his rare condition, trichothiodystrophy. Maria fought for him and established the Friends of Sammy-Joe Foundation in 2006 to raise awareness and to support other families in similar situations. Sammy-Joe was not expected to live beyond 25 years of age, but today he is 36 years old—largely due to his mother's sheer and unwavering determination.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Agnes Nsofwa established the Australian sickle cell advocacy group. I'm proud to have been the inaugural patron of this very important organisation; it was a real highlight to launch ASCA at the Royal Children's Hospital in 2018. Even more so, Agnes lobbied and succeeded in getting newborn screening for sickle cell disease added to the newborn bloodspot screening program, and I want to thank this government for actually implementing it. It's made a huge difference to the community.</span>

Wendy overcame the impact of childhood trauma and abuse to educate herself and fight for the rights of all caregivers. The apology that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered to the forgotten Australians was a milestone in Wendy's life, and it encouraged her not only to not stop campaigning but to continue to campaign to improve the lives of many others.</span>

Dorette was the first woman to qualify as a dentist in her hometown of Basra in Iraq. There are many such qualified medical practitioners and other professionals from Iraq and Syria living in my electorate. Like Dorette, they have made me acutely aware of the enormous talents, skills and qualifications within our diverse communities, especially the refugee communities, which we should respect, support, harness and recognise. We should find a way, at least, to allow them to participate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aynur Simsirel is a teacher, education adviser and, now, Ilim College's new chief executive officer. I've worked with Aynur over the years but more recently following October 7. She has been instrumental in guiding the school's response to the consequences of October 7. In her caring and compassionate manner, she set up support groups for the children who lost family members in Gaza and, later, those who came to Australia from Gaza. They have settled in Calwell, and my local community has embraced them with love and support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental ill health is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and, along with addiction, the sheer weight of its impact is wreaking havoc in the lives of our constituents, especially young people. The mental health of our community is as vital as its physical health. As it currently stands, the mental health system is overstretched and therefore limited in its capacity to respond at all times. This is especially critical in the non-English-speaking communities, where attitudes to mental illness and addiction are influenced by cultural nuances such as shame, lack of information about getting help and an inability to navigate the system. We need to support and partner with the mental health professionals, the mental health advocates and the grassroots community groups who are well-placed to be part of a more holistic approach. One such example is Mental Health Foundation Australia, a grassroots organisation focused on providing a referral service for multicultural communities. They do amazing work, and they're effective, but they don't receive any government funding. I'm joining their board, and I hope to use my knowledge about how this place works to convince government that the foundation should be supported. If community is prepared to step up, government must be prepared to step up also. We shouldn't stick to the usual funding script alone. I want to give a big shout-out to team GROW Clinical Psychology, a psychology clinic in Roxburgh Park using their professional expertise and cultural and linguistic know-how to help our local Turkish-speaking community. The practice recently received one of the inaugural Stronger Medicare Awards, recognising its exceptional service.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the changes in demographics over the years, Calwell remains a predominantly blue-collar constituency. The loss of the car industry—and, particularly, for us, the closure of Ford—continues to have a huge impact on the local economy and employment opportunities. A lot of local people have lost jobs through the decline of manufacturing, once a mainstay of Melbourne's northern suburbs. But I'm proud to say that this government has not given up on Australian manufacturing, and we have seen new industries grow, including in food production and medical and advanced manufacturing. When I was first elected, the Kangan TAFE boasted a state-of-the-art aviation school. Sadly, that is now gone, but Kangan, with the support of the state government, has built a new health and community centre of excellence, opening this Thursday, which the minister and I visited recently. Maybe we can get leave to go and share some birthday cake with them. That's always been a problem, you know. The leave business has always been a problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we have faced change that is not always welcome in my community, we are resilient and resourceful, and we are always looking to the future. The electorate has changed in shape and complexion. Where Craigieburn was once the outer fringe of Calwell, it is now the geographic centre, and the northern growth corridor stretches ever further north. The member for McEwen and I have always tussled and had fights about Craigieburn, because it keeps bouncing between us during the redistributions. I've got all of it back now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate now reflects the new sources of migration to Australia, including from the subcontinent—the countries of India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan, in addition to, as I've already mentioned, the large refugee communities from Iraq and Syria. Faith is central to many people's lives in Calwell. Our faith communities now include the rapidly growing Sikh, Hindu and Buddhist communities. I've enjoyed my longstanding relationships with a number of temples, and particularly with the Tibetan Buddhist Society, and one of their very important leaders, the venerable Anna Goldstein, who I worked with many, many years ago in the office of Joan Kirner, when she was the education minister. Life has a strange way of coming around.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is ironic, therefore, that I, who vehemently and publicly opposed Australia's involvement in the Iraq War in my first term here, would end representing in this place the biggest constituency of refugees from the region, who are Chaldean Christians and Assyrians. The churches play a central role in their lives. For many years, I have worked closely with Father Maher and others. I even helped bring the then governor-general, Sir Peter Cosgrove, to attend mass at the Chaldean Church of our Lady of the Plants. The community was thrilled to have the Governor-General in their church. It was a powerful sign of connecting to this country's highest office, and it made them feel that they were truly included in Australian society.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to add my praise for the caring principal of the Good Samaritan Primary School in Roxburgh Park, Paul Sedunary, and his wonderful staff. I thank them especially for the work they do with the young refugee children. Seventy per cent of their students are refugees from Iraq and Syria, and, recently, from Gaza. This school and its staff, including the beautiful Ban, who is their liaison officer, go above and beyond the call of duty. Of course, there are many incredible public schools and non-government schools throughout my electorate who continue to do a wonderful job of teaching and supporting our young people. Visiting as many of them as I have been able to has been one of the highlights of my parliamentary career and has allowed me to continue to practice my teaching skills—and I have come to the conclusion that if I were to be back into the classroom now, I'd be in all sorts of trouble. I'm completely out of date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to begin by thanking Mary Elizabeth Calwell for her friendship. She has remained a constant and loyal friend, ensuring my connection to Labor history, Labor values and the legacy of her father, the man who my electorate is named after, remains strong and well-informed. Arthur Calwell was a visionary operating within the context of his time. As such, he can only be described as bold, courageous and with a firm commitment to acting in Australia's national interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my staff—and there have been so many over the years; too many to mention, so I'll try and do that another time—I just want to say thank you to all of you, current and past. Some of you have gone onto do exceptional things, and I'm very proud of you. I do want to make a special mention to the longest-serving members of my team. Helen Patsikatheodorou, otherwise known in our community as the 'pink mayor', on account of her having been Mayor of the City of Hume twice during her diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer. In our office, she is known as: 'If anyone can, Helen can,' because of her unyielding assistance to our community and her determination to solve problems, and she does. Joanne Dougall was with me from the beginning, and after a break she returned to the office. It's only fitting that we retire together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Carole Fabian when she interviewed me for that electorate officer's job in 1987. We often joke that I went on to become the boss, and I am the boss now. I hope I'm a good boss. Also Basem Abdo, who is now the Labor candidate for Calwell. I look forward to watching Basem take our community forward into the future. He is young and smart, and I have no doubt he will make an excellent contribution both in here and in the electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, to my family—there they are—guess who's back! My husband, Michalis; my daughter, Stella; and my son, Stavros. They were six and eight when they were first here, which gives you an idea of just how long I've been here. It hasn't been easy for you guys, but it's been very hard for me. The 24/7 job I stepped up for meant I had to find ways of accommodating its demands and expectations with those of my family and personal life. I have missed so much while I have been up here in all those years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I tried to manage it by ensuring that I always knew where my kids were and that I always took their calls, no matter where I was or who I was with—there are some stories, and I won't name that prime minister! I took helicopter parenting to new levels. Today it would be drones, and I reckon they would have been more useful. I solved problems ranging from finding socks to what to have for dinner and everything else in between, and I did all that over the phone. Zoom and video weren't available in those early years, and, now that they are, no-one at home really has the time to sit and zoom with me while I'm up here. I don't think they want to, either! My life revolved around the parliamentary sitting calendar, and so did my family's. They were sometimes resentful, but we remained close and intact along the way. I want to thank you for the many times you have said to me: 'It's okay, Mum. Don't worry. We're good.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've known so many people in this building. So many wonderful people make up the sum of who we are in this place. In my opinion, ours is one of the best parliaments in the world and the most architecturally elegant, and no-one should say anything other than that. I've enjoyed being here. It has been a privilege to have sat in this chamber. It truly is a measure of our success as a modern multicultural democratic nation that we are given opportunities to participate and to be heard no matter who we are, where we come from, our colour, our creed or whatever. But it has been an even greater privilege to have been given the opportunity to serve my local community of Calwell, and I want to thank them for eight consecutive terms of support. I have grown to know them so well, and I'm very proud of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you all. We are a great country and we are a successful country, but we shouldn't take our lucky country for granted. It's our responsibility to protect it, regardless of our difference. To you, Mr Speaker, I hope I've been of some use over the years as a mentor in the early days before you rose to fame. You have been a really good Speaker, so I want to leave with this: geia sas, sas efcharisto kai kali synechia. Loosely translated: see you later—I think you all know what 'geia sas' means—thank you, and may you go forward successfully. Thank you.</span>

It was full of grace and gratitude and particularly concentrated on the importance of supporting multiculturalism and Australia's diversity—something that she has done in her entire time in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her electorate, of course, is one of Australia's most multicultural. In any visit that I've made to that electorate, Maria is someone who has engaged with those multicultural communities, brought people together and enhanced social cohesion. She can be proud of all she has given in service of the Labor Party and our nation, and in Basem Abdo, whose campaign I was happy to launch with Maria at an early learning centre in her electorate in Calwell in December, she has found a replacement who will carry on a commitment to multiculturalism and to looking after the people of Calwell. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  Like that of just about everybody who gets to this place, my journey here was not entirely straightforward. In 2007, Manuela, Gabriel and I were living in Surry Hills—a lovely part of Sydney but not very fruitful territory if you wanted to be a Liberal MP. So we moved to Miranda, and I sought Liberal preselection for the seat of Cook, covering the Sutherland Shire of Sydney. As history records, I did not succeed. But, just 18 months later, Dr Brendan Nelson announced he would be stepping down in Bradfield. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Manuela, Gabriel and I were now back in Surry Hills, living in a recently, and rather expensively, architecturally renovated terrace house with our family expanded by the happy arrival of Hugo, then around six months old. So when I told Manuela that I was turning my attention from the southern suburbs of Sydney to the northern suburbs of Sydney she took a moment to gather her enthusiasm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But very soon she was fully on board for this latest quest—and, if the Princess Highway heading south had been the boulevard of broken dreams, the Pacific Highway heading north turned out to be the yellow brick road. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within a few short months I was standing in this chamber giving my maiden speech, as it happens, precisely 15 years and one day ago—although it feels like five minutes. In that speech, I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I want to be a voice for rational policymaking which recognises some basic realities—the reality that we are a small country in a large world which does not owe us a living; the reality that the prosperity we enjoy today is not guaranteed but needs continual work; the reality that our prosperity depends much more on the efforts of the private sector than the public sector; …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How would I assess my performance against the aim of being such a voice for rational policymaking? In the marking scale used when I was a student at Sydney university in the 1980s, I would not give myself a high distinction or even a distinction, but I think it's probably worth a credit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky to work on some issues where I had relevant expertise. After the 2013 election I was made parliamentary secretary to the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull. He asked me to take charge of the Mobile Black Spot Program, our election commitment to spend $100 million on better mobile phone coverage in rural and remote Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I travelled all around the country, holding community meetings and visiting black spots, as we finalised the rules of the scheme and kicked it off. A lot of people said to me, 'Telstra has the best network in regional and remote Australia,' so just give all the money to them. But I thought we could design a reverse-auction process to maximise the competitive pressure on the three telcos—Telstra, Optus and Vodafone—and in turn maximise the number of new base stations we would get for the money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the telcos lodged their bids, it was clear the strategy had worked. For this relatively modest sum, they collectively committed to build 499 new mobile base stations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I drew several lessons from this experience. First, well-designed, competitive selection processes are a good way to get value for money for the taxpayer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, you should aim to have government intervene just enough to get the outcome needed but no more—in this case, what was the smallest subsidy we could pay to get a telco to build a new mobile base station?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third and most important, in politics we are often seeking to deliver emotionally important outcomes. But the more work you put into developing a rational and carefully designed policy, the better your chances of getting the outcome you seek.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of careful policy work, we didn't get 200 or 300 or 400 new base stations; we got 499.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am certain that for every one of those there are people alive today because a triple 0 call could be made and help obtained quickly after a farm accident or a car crash on a country road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The emotional outcome—enormously important—is saving lives, as well as all the other benefits, such as being able to make or receive a phone call in areas where before this program it was impossible. But we got a much better outcome because of good policy design.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All too often in this place, the fact that the objective is important, that it is emotionally compelling, is the excuse for poor, ill-disciplined, wasteful policy design. As I will touch on later, I regard the National Disability Insurance Scheme as suffering from this problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I drew on these policy principles time after time as a minister. Working on the news media bargaining code with Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison, we wanted just enough intervention to bring Google and Facebook to the negotiating table with Australian news media businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The process we designed worked as intended, securing some $200 million in payments from the platforms, not only improving the profitability of Australian news media businesses but also leading to a lot more journalists being employed. It is a shame that the current government has not been able to continue our work effectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, I am pleased that in other areas this government has continued directions I established. I welcome their support for the eSafety Commissioner, and I'm delighted to see Julie Inman Grant in the gallery today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the more sensible approach to extending the NBN fibre rollout. Instead of building fibre to every home, now there is fibre built down the middle of the street, with the connection to the customer's home done only when the customer orders a high-speed broadband service—a much more efficient use of taxpayers' capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the changes I made to Australian content rules for free-to-air television have not been reversed. These rules required commercial TV networks to show multiple hours of specified content, including drama and children's content, each week. But not many people watched it, and much of this content was low-cost, low-production-value material produced solely to meet the quota.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes I made aligned with what I saw as the broader strategic goal for the Australian screen production sector—how to make shows that would sell globally, including to the global streaming services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we needed to remove perverse incentives to create content that was not globally saleable. We also needed to give better financial support for the production of television content, including streaming, so we increased the producer offset for television from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Screen Producers Association strongly opposed these changes, but I believe they were a positive for the screen sector. And, while there are ups and downs from year to year, over the past few years we've seen a clear upward trend in Australian screen production.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my most challenging times as communications minister was the 2019-20 bushfires. On the worst day, around 150 mobile base stations were off the air across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. No mobile coverage means no EFTPOS and no capacity to call or text for help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a reminder of something we too often overlook: the sustainability of the physical telecommunications networks which underpin the internet and, in turn, the digital economy. These networks are built and maintained by Telstra, Optus, TPG, NBN and the rest of our telco sector. In many places these networks are vulnerable, with little or no network redundancy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an economic issue as well as a network design issue. The margins made by the telcos in building and operating networks are modest, while the global tech firms which write over those networks are making supernormal returns. This disparity presents a growing risk, in my view, and needs policy attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues in communications were interesting and important. Equally fascinating were the issues in cities and urban infrastructure, a portfolio in which I served under various names from 2015 until 2018 and then again for nearly 18 months from late 2020, when it was added to my continuing responsibilities for communications and the arts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The high point, undoubtedly, was working on the Western Sydney airport. When Malcolm Turnbull asked me to take responsibility for this project, I set out to learn as much as I could about airports in general and about this project in particular. I visited Changi Airport in Singapore; Incheon in Korea; Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton in Britain; Schiphol in the Netherlands; and Dallas-Fort Worth in the US, in each case meeting the chief executive and other members of the executive team. All of them were extremely generous with their time and insights. This was a policy nerd's dream trip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also spent many months engaging with the Sydney Airport Corporation. This company held a legally binding right of first refusal to develop the Western Sydney airport but, in the end, decided not to take up that right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were well prepared for that scenario and announced almost immediately that the Commonwealth would establish a special-purpose company, WSA Co, to build the airport, with funding of $5.3 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will not just be a new airport; it is the core of a new western parkland city, a new third city for the Sydney basin. It will have parks and recreational space. It will have a 23-kilometre-long metro rail line, with six stations running north to south, as the spine of the new city. It will have medium- and high-density housing around the stations. Because of the airport and the businesses the airport will attract, there will be jobs locally for people who live in that housing. This is urban policy, economic policy, transport policy and environmental policy all coming together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this would have happened without the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister, the key role that Lucy Turnbull played as chair of the Greater Sydney Commission and the strong backing for this vision from New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian and her government. I worked particularly closely with the then New South Wales Minister for Western Sydney, Stuart Ayres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stuart and I worked closely with the eight councils who had joined with the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments in the Western Sydney City Deal. I was impressed with the way the councils stepped up to think about what was best not just for their area but for the whole of Western Sydney. I acknowledge the advocacy of key Western Sydney leaders like David Borger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anybody who has had the chance to drive down The Northern Road and look at the massive Western Sydney airport site and how well-developed that project is would agree with me that this is going to have a very big impact for our city and our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In years to come, I believe Western Sydney airport and the associated policy framework, including the Western Sydney City Deal, will be seen as a template for urban policymaking in Australia. It's important for a host of reasons, including the huge challenge of housing affordability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can deliver new planned cities like this, with a combination of medium- and high-density housing, extensive parklands and local economic activity delivering local jobs, we have a powerful policy tool to bring a growing supply of affordable housing in areas which offer good quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the solution to housing affordability, I believe, comes with delivering better public transport connections, particularly rail, between our big cities and surrounding regions. This lets people buy homes in more affordable areas while remaining plugged into the economy and jobs markets of our big cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We did significant planning work between the Commonwealth and state governments on what we called faster rail. In the 2022 budget we announced funding for three rail corridors from the federal government: $1 billion for a corridor between Sydney and Newcastle; $1.1 billion for a corridor between Brisbane and the Gold Coast; and $1.6 billion for a corridor between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast. I want to acknowledge the two members for the Sunshine Coast, with whom I worked very, very closely on securing that announcement, and the 'on again, off again, but ultimately on again'—as best as can be determined—commitment from the current government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the 90-kilometre corridor from Brisbane to the Gold Coast, our funding was targeted to a 19-kilometre segment between two stations roughly halfway along the corridor. This would double capacity from two tracks to four and realign and straighten the tracks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should you care? Because having a stretch of four tracks means you can run more express trains and all-stops trains. It gives benefits along the whole corridor, allowing faster, more frequent and reliable services. It's not a coincidence that that was also what the funding for the Newcastle-to-Sydney corridor was dedicated to, similarly increasing from two tracks to four.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This might not be as exciting as very fast trains, but it's targeted, it's cost-effective is and it will deliver tangible benefits within a few years. It was a privilege to work on these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also a privilege to be the Commonwealth arts minister. This brought some extraordinary experiences, such as visiting the set of <span style="font-style:italic;">Thor: Love </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Thunder</span> in Sydney and giving then 11-year-old Hugo the chance to meet Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, who were both extremely charming, I must say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally special were the days spent visiting artists in four Indigenous communities in the APY Lands in the north of South Australia. Travelling with then South Australian Premier and arts minister Steven Marshall, I met some remarkable Australians, including Robert Fielding and Betty Kuntiwa Pumani, winner of the 2017 Wynne Prize.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no more distinctive feature of brand Australia than Indigenous art. As arts minister, I spoke very deliberately of wanting to build the market for Indigenous art. I visited Desert Mob in Alice Springs, Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair and the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair. These are important marketplaces where very talented artists can earn an economic return and buyers can purchase remarkable works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When COVID came along, almost immediately performances were cancelled, venues were closed and artists and crews lost their gigs. I felt a tremendous sense of responsibility. Could we devise policy settings to help sustain the arts sector and get it going again once COVID was over?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We could. I want to acknowledge the strong support of Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg. The Morrison government provided unprecedented support to the arts sector, with more than $10 billion in wages and cashflow support under programs like JobKeeper. Our $200 million RISE fund supported 541 projects, created more than 213,000 jobs and stimulated a two-year pipeline of events, with an estimated total audience of many millions of people. We managed to get money into art forms that had been underfunded for a long time and money into suburban and regional Australia, which normally do not see a very big share of the Commonwealth arts funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Left-leaning journalists at the ABC and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>—I acknowledge that phrase is a tautology—take it as an article of faith that the arts sector receives support stronger support under Labor than the coalition. Let me give you this fact. In 2021-22, under the Morrison government, there was record Commonwealth government funding to the arts of more than $1 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say in particular to those coalition supporters in the arts sector: yours can seem a lonely and dangerous existence, I know, but I know you are there and actually in quite surprising numbers in some places. After all, artists, theatres and bands are businesses. Today we think of Shakespeare as a genius playwright, but he was also an entrepreneur, taking risks, employing people and building a business. I reckon old Will would have understood the solid policy case for giving small businesses with a turnover of less than $10 million a capped tax deduction of up to $20,000 for business related meal and entertainment expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In communications, arts and infrastructure I was lucky to have had some prior interest and exposure, but when new Prime Minister Scott Morrison asked me to become social services minister in August 2018 I was coming into a portfolio about which I knew little. I only did the job for nine months. I learned a lot in a short time. I lived in constant fear that a journalist would start an interview with the question, 'Minister, what is the JobSeeker payment for single adults under 55?' Since you ask, it's $778 a fortnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The portfolio included the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We need to acknowledge reality. The costs of this scheme are running wildly out of control and the governance and controls are deeply unsatisfactory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I referred earlier to the tendency in this place to use high emotional importance as the excuse for poor, ill-disciplined, wasteful policy design. This is what I believe has happened with the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Its advocates promised that, by spending more money on people with disability, the scheme would increase their capacity to work and to make a productive contribution and, in turn, it would generate economic benefits. That is a very worthwhile goal, but there is little evidence that it is happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a well-designed, well-targeted, efficient scheme to support people with a disability, but what we have is very far from that, and every Australian taxpayer is being hit with a big and rising annual bill. There is a lot of work needed to fix this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something else our nation would benefit from, in my view, is a scheme under which older Australians can use some of their superannuation balance to purchase an annuity from the Commonwealth. Recently I was interested to see the Grattan Institute advocating such a scheme. Just to be clear, my view is it should be a choice. I would strongly oppose compulsion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another policy in another portfolio I think we should adopt is a system of per kilometre road-user charging for electric vehicles. I advocated for this unsuccessfully as urban infrastructure minister, pointing out in one speech that, under our current fuel-excise system, somebody driving an old Holden Commodore is effectively paying 4.5c a kilometre through fuel excise to use our roads, but, if you drive a Tesla, you're paying nothing. In other words, we have a fairness problem, but we also have a problem that, as the share of electric vehicles rises, revenue from the fuel excise will drop. Today this is a revenue stream in net terms of some $11 billion or $12 billion, which is money we rely on to pay for building new roads and maintaining existing roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, it would be fair and sensible to impose a federal per kilometre charge on electric vehicles set at a rate derived from the average effective rate per kilometre paid by users of petrol and diesel vehicles through the fuel excise system. Today electric vehicles are relatively expensive, and they're bought by more affluent Australians, so such a charge is unlikely to discourage electric vehicle sales. Rather than undermining the transition to electric vehicles, I see this as a policy measure which supports this inevitable and desirable transition by getting our road-funding arrangements set up for a world in which more and more vehicles are electric. It's one of a number of things I think we need to do, along with rolling out better and more comprehensive charging infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for those who would criticise this as a new tax, my answer is, on the contrary, it's about updating an existing tax to deal with technological change. Liberals want to see the lowest possible taxes charged fairly across the broadest possible tax base. If most Australians have no choice but to pay a tax but a small minority avoid it by buying an expensive vehicle using the latest technology, then we have a problem with the design of the tax and we need to fix it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you're a minister, you regard parliament as an annoying constraint on your work. You have to answer all those pesky questions, and, when you have a bill, you have to get it through the chamber. But, in this term, as Manager of Opposition Business, I've had to pay a lot more attention to the workings of the parliament. I want to thank and acknowledge you, Mr Speaker. Working collaboratively with you was an unexpected pleasure, but I have formed some clear views about how this place works and how it could improve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our voting process in the chamber is inefficient. It should be electronic. In my view, once the Speaker says, 'Ring the bells for four minutes,' after members have come in and the doors are locked, members would hold up a smartcard or their phone to a reader. The vote would be captured and electronically tallied, and it could all be done in a minute or two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having question time at 2 pm is inefficient. So much time is spent across this building every day preparing for possible questions in ministers' offices and working out questions to ask in other offices. It should be at 11 am with the standing orders providing for it to conclude automatically by 12.30 pm at the latest. This would free up lunchtime for meetings and events, and it would reduce the amount of the day committed to fairly unproductive short-term work in preparing for question time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three-year terms are inefficient. To move to four-year terms should be a no-brainer. Under our current system, within about a year and a half, you start to hit the pause button on doing anything significant because your first consideration is how it might play in the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might conclude from some of these comments that you are listening to a grumpy, splenetic man leaving the parliament, disgruntled that his greatness has not been recognised and spraying around a collection of uncharitable observations as a parting gesture. On the contrary, as I leave this place I am not disgruntled at all; rather, I feel a deep sense of gratitude for the opportunity to serve in parliament and as a cabinet minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only possible because of the Liberal Party, and the committed and dedicated volunteer members of the party in Bradfield and all across Australia. Our democracy is a precious and fragile thing. People who commit their time and energy and often money in being a member of a political party make an absolutely vital contribution to that democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot mention everybody in Bradfield who helped me but I do want to acknowledge my three FEC presidents Alister Henskens, Carolyn Cameron and Jon Stewart; and to mention just a few others Nick Campbell, Jimmy Chen, Namoi Dougall, Penny George-Farlow, Ros and Geoff Jarrett, Robyn and Roger Kerr, Charles and Belinda Khong, Brett and Vicki Kvisle, Simon and Alicia Lennon, Michael Li and Michelle Lam-Li, Alan and Lyndy Lipman, Jenny Powell, Victoria Qiu, the late and much missed Geoff Selig and Jane Selig, Les and Lorraine Taylor, Barbara and Gary Ward, Jan and Tony Ward, James and Leanne Winter and Di Woods. I have missed out many others and I apologise but I certainly recognised and appreciated your support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My Liberal Party involvement goes back to 1981 when I joined the Young Liberals and 1983 when I joined the Sydney University Liberal Club. I retain close friends dating back to those days, including Stephen Coutts, Patrick Fair, Don Harwin, Marise Payne and Michael Photios, all of whom helped me very considerably as I sought out a seat in parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those engaged in careful decoding, yes, all are self-proclaimed moderate Liberals, as am I. So too are other good friends who helped me on my journey, including Matthew Abbott, David Begg, Simon Birmingham, Scott Briggs, John Brogden, Matt Cross, Matt Daniel, Jason Falinski, Joe Hockey, Matt Kean, Brendan Lyon, Natalie Ward, Sam Witheridge and Trent Zimmerman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I may be a moderate but I am a strong believer in the importance of diversity of opinion in our party room. The Liberal Party is at its best when both our conservative and our small-l liberal traditions are respected. Most Liberal Party members and overwhelmingly our voters have zero interest in factions and arcane internal ideological squabbles. They simply want to see a strong, capable, sensible centre-right government which is careful with their money, which works to build a stronger economy and which keeps a careful eye on our national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud of our coalition parliamentary team and the discipline and focus we have shown over this term, under Peter Dutton's leadership. We are a real prospect for government, which 2½ years ago seemed most unlikely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My parliamentary career was only possible because the people of Bradfield saw fit to place their trust in me for six successive elections. Politicians as a class are not held in terribly high regard by the Australian people, but they tend to make an exception for their own local MP. I have been treated with courtesy and kindness, and I thank the people of Bradfield for that. Over recent weeks as I have gone about the electorate I have been very touched by the number of people who have come up to me to wish me well for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it was only possible because of the love and support from my family. I am so pleased that my wife, Manuela, my stepson Gabriel and my son Hugo have joined me at Parliament House today. I have put them through a lot and I am very grateful. As I often say when Manuela joins me at political events, she is the human face of the operation. But as well as being a wonderful wife and mum, she is also a very talented jewellery designer and accomplished businesswoman, with her store, Zappacosta Jewels, having operated successfully in the Strand Arcade in Sydney for over 20 years. I am very proud of what she has achieved.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to gratitude to family members, I also want to mention my mum, Mary, my sister Sam, her husband, Andrew, and sons Tim and Nic. All of them have handed out at numerous elections and helped in countless other ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful to all my personal friends and supporters who have helped out on campaigns—including, softly be it said, some who are not Liberal voters but still came along to put on the T-shirt and hand out for me. I am grateful to the many people and organisations who made political donations in support of campaigns in Bradfield and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful to the four leaders I have served under: Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton. All gave me opportunities to contribute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful to the many wonderful colleagues I have worked with in the coalition party room over more than 15 years, and I also want to acknowledge and express thanks for friendships with people across the parliament, of every political stripe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm grateful to all who served as my staff in my electorate office and in my ministerial and shadow ministerial offices, quite a few of whom are here today. I can't mention everybody, but, in my electorate office, Jackie Barnes and Jacquie Parker were key in earlier and later years respectively. As chief of staff at various stages, Luke Coleman, Alex Waldren, Boronia Morison, Ryan Bloxsom and Brooke Curtin led my office very capably. I was pleased to have a number of ministerial staffers with deep sector experience, like Emma McDonald. I want to particularly mention the wise, unflappable and often extremely amusing Imre Salusinszky.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me close by speaking about why I am optimistic for Australia and our future. This sentiment can feel rather unfashionable at the moment, but I think we live in a remarkable country with a very bright future. We should give ourselves more credit than we do for our remarkable national achievement in building the most successful, multi-ethnic, multiracial, multicultural, multireligious nation in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Bradfield is a microcosm of Australia. Almost 25 per cent of its residents report being of Chinese heritage, another four per cent are Indian, three per cent are Korean—and many other backgrounds as well. I should acknowledge our Armenian community, our South African community, our Jewish community—and there are plenty of others that I'm forgetting in that quick list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I see in our schools, in Scouts and Guides groups, in sporting clubs and in so many other institutions is a no-nonsense, lets-get-on-with-it attitude to make everyone feel welcome and included regardless of who they are or where they come from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not mandated by governments or decreed by bureaucrats. It is the ordinary practice of millions of Australians—building relationships and making friendships, and thereby overcoming the suspicion and mistrust that all too easily can arise between people of different backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm optimistic about Australia's future because I believe we will keep attracting smart, motivated, energetic people from around the world. Our focus on skilled migration for many decades has served Australia very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also optimistic about technology. When I reflect on the unbelievable changes just in my own lifetime, to me the evidence of scientific and technological advancement improving our lives is absolutely compelling.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a strand of thinking on the far left which hankers for some kind of pretechnological state of grace and purity. It is delusional. How anyone can maintain this belief the first time they have a serious dental issue requiring treatment is entirely beyond me.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do I think all applications of technology are positive? Of course not. But consider the internet—it has transformed the way we live, work, meet our partners, entertain ourselves, do business and a hundred other things besides.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is there a lot of pointless, stupid stuff on TikTok and social media generally? Of course there is. But the phenomenal amount of practical, useful information available to any one of us is, in my view, absolutely something to celebrate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'What about artificial intelligence?' I hear you say. 'It's going to take our jobs.' As the expression goes, predictions are hard, especially about the future, but we can see a clear pattern from every previous wave of new technology. There has been alarm that it would destroy jobs. Instead, it has changed jobs and created new jobs while increasing prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'What about global warming?' you ask. 'Aren't we all doomed?' Let me be clear—I absolutely believe that we're seeing an increase in the parts per million of carbon, that there's a link to the burning of fossil fuels and that we need to phase out fossil fuels, and of course net zero is the clear commitment of the Liberal and National parties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm an optimist that the human race will get this job done, and science and technology will be the way that we will do it. I have to say I'm even more optimistic now, after spending 2½ years as shadow minister for science, visiting supersmart scientists, researchers and businesspeople all around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once you've had a few decades on this planet, you've heard plenty of examples of seriously scary things that are about to destroy us. When I was a school and university debater, it was the coming ice age. Later it was peak oil. Then there was the Y2K bug—remember that? It was going to bring the entire global economy to its knees because computers had been programmed with only a two-digit field for the date back in the sixties and seventies, and, once the date flipped over from 31 December 1999 to 1 January 2000, everything would suddenly stop working, chaos would descend and zombies would walk the earth. It didn't happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are things that it's rational to be concerned about, but to be rationally concerned about risks and threats is one thing; to plunge from that into despair is not the right response. I believe the right mindset for our nation and indeed for our world, to use the title of an impressive recent book, is rational optimism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude. It has been a privilege to serve in this place for 15 years. It is time for renewal. Thank you. It has been great. Keep in touch.</span>

He has been in our leadership group as Leader of the House. As he said, he's served under four leaders in our party, and we have each seen great qualities in Paul, and he hasn't let us down. He's been able to contribute to many debates because of his business background and because of his intellect, and his capacity has been on display around the shadow cabinet table and the cabinet table for a long period of time. We will miss him in his seat, but I know he's done a lot of work to help Gisele and provide support to a transition, which is going to be incredibly important, because we want to maintain that seat, and we want Gisele Kapterian in this parliament as the next member for Bradfield.</span>

Families often make a sacrifice, and that's true in the Fletcher household as well. But Fletch has an incredible next career ahead of him. He has been a dear friend, a confidant and a great supporter to many of us for a long period of time, and we wish him every success in the next phase of life.</span>

Paul has made an extraordinary contribution for his side of politics. The role of Manager of Opposition Business is where we have worked most closely together, and on that I simply say that the most important thing about that relationship is that in the worst and most heated moments you can trust that you will always be honest with each other. Paul has been impeccably honest and has kept to every agreement that was made—and when he couldn't make an agreement, he just said so. In terms of the running of the parliament, I don't think you can ever ask for more than the integrity that comes with that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of his portfolio, for his side of politics, the legacy is extraordinary, and I'm glad he focused so much on Western Sydney Airport, which has been an issue which has gone back and forth—certainly well before I arrived here, and before the Leader of the Opposition arrived here. It was a live issue when the Prime Minister first arrived here. To have played a significant role in that development is something he'll be forever proud of.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  Standing to give a valedictory speech after just three years as the Independent federal member for North Sydney is nothing short of surreal. No-one—well, except maybe Antony Green—could have predicted this plot twist, especially given that, when as a community we decided to take our voice and our vote back in 2022, we had plans that reached well beyond one parliamentary term. At the time we were deeply dissatisfied with what we saw as a lack of direction or ambition offered by either of the major parties. Regardless of what our MP said to our faces in our electorate, when they came here they would always cast North Sydney's vote the way the party instructed them to. The blue tie/red tie dynamic was too focused on working for itself rather than for us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we wanted faster action on climate change, we were witnessing prevarication and outright denial. We were literally told we were overreacting and we needed to calm down. Where we expected integrity, transparency and accountability from those in parliament, we were instead offered $10 million in regional sporting grants to fix our iconic—and not-so-regional—North Sydney Olympic Pool. It seemed the expectations for appropriate conduct set by us ordinary folks were too pedestrian, and we were told that if we had a problem with that we could take it up at the next election. Where we wanted to see a society where everyone could reach their full potential regardless of gender, racial, cultural, sexual or religious background, we were offered a government hell-bent on advocating for women only when it was not 'at the expense of anyone else' and who openly castigated those who wanted true equity as 'woke'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, after 115 years as a safe Liberal seat, we did the unthinkable and turned up en masse to take our parliamentary voice and vote back, rather than simply handing it over yet again to an unresponsive and disrespectful party system. As one of the first seats ever established in Australia, North Sydney has a long history of not just looking out for ourselves but doing what we can to ensure no-one is left behind. While some have decided to describe us as 'woke, latte-sipping, inner-city dwellers', my community has contributed much to our country, from innovation to leadership and economic stimulus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my community's champion in this place, I've done everything I could to ensure our authentic voice was heard here—not one filtered through a party backroom but one that has been raw, honest and at times controversial. That has taken courage but courage is something North Sydney has in spades, as was evidenced by the way we approached the Voice referendum in 2023. Offering my respects to the traditional custodians of the land that I am speaking on—the Ngunnawal and the Ngambri—as well as to the traditional custodians of the land on which my seat sits—the Cammeraygal and Wallumattagal—isn't something I do because it's politically correct; I do it because I was taught we should respect those who have come before us, honour the legacy they have left us and aspire to learn the lessons they pass to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of our First Nations people, for many years our country has not listened for what we might learn, instead often choosing to pursue agendas which assume we know better than those who are living the experience firsthand. This attitude has seen what is often described as 'well-intentioned policies' pursued relentlessly, even as those impacted by them have asked us to step back and listen—and we seem determined to carry on in that fashion. I don't say this from some high horse but as someone who has been an active member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and who, in that role, has witnessed some of the most reductive thinking I have seen from people in this place when it comes to recognising and honouring First Nations people's capacity to make decisions for themselves. In 2023, my community's courage, compassion and wisdom to vote for the Voice to Parliament reaffirmed that I was absolutely representing the right people. Ultimately, I believe we must confront our past, embrace the learnings and pursue true reconciliation with the First Peoples of this continent in a way that prioritises fairness and respect.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a step back and share a very personal truth with you—that being that, as my parents will attest, as a child I dreaded the game of musical chairs. It was such an anxiety-provoking experience for me, as I hated the thought of having to race or fight for a chair and I worried how the person who did miss out would be left feeling. Fast forward to today, and I can't help but laugh at the fact that I seem to have found myself once again in a game of musical chairs and no seat is left for me. As my seat in this place is abolished, however, rather than feeling anxious I feel really deep gratitude for the extraordinary experience serving my community has been. From the rapid learning curve through to the sheer volume of information I've had access to, the great minds I've heard speak, the people I've met and the processes I've witnessed, the learnings I take from this place will last me a lifetime. That's because, as an Independent on this House of Representatives crossbench of the 47th parliament, I have been one of just 151 people in this country who have had the opportunity to develop, discuss, debate and decide the laws that govern us, and that is a pretty bloody extraordinary thing to have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the boundaries of my electorate have ebbed and flowed over time, with Warringah created in 1922 and Bradfield and Bennelong in 1949, North Sydney has always held its own until the most recent Australian Electoral Commission review of our electoral boundaries. Over 124 years, North Sydney has been a seat of many firsts. In 1900, we were one of the original 75 divisions created that contested the first federal election in 1901. In 1990, we elected Ted Mack, who was the first Independent in the modern era of politics, breaking an 89-year-old hold on the seat by conservative party politicians. In 2015, we elected Trent Zimmerman, the first openly LGBTIQA member in the House of Representatives. In 2021, we were the first new seat to announce our intention to run an Independent in the 2022 election. And in 2022, I became the first woman and only the second Independent to win the seat. In 2025, we're the first Federation seat and the first seat held by an Independent to be abolished and, to be honest, I could have done without those last two firsts. While I think ending as an Independent seat held by a woman is a great way to go out, I do want to acknowledge the members for North Sydney who came before me, all who contributed more than what they took from this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving forward, our community will be absorbed into Warringah, Bradfield and Bennelong. While it is the end of an era, I know the courage, conviction and compassion of the North Sydney community will strengthen those electorates. I've tried not to take a single minute for granted in this place, with people much wiser than me, including the inimitable Cathy McGowan sitting up there in the wings, counselling me very early on that I needed to work like I had just one term—and thank goodness I took their advice! Working with my community, my team and others in this place and key stakeholders across society, I've introduced three private member's bills to parliament to drive broader discussion and legislative reform. One was to bring Australia into line with the rest of the world and give people access to cleaner cars. Another was to end indefinite detention and finally make it illegal for the Australian government to hold those fleeing for their lives and seeking our protection for more than 90 days or to detain children. The final one was to apply a human rights framework to housing and homelessness policy and bring consumer voices to the front of that debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the power of working across political lines and building consensus and awareness, I've also worked with parliamentary friendship groups, including establishing the Parliamentary Friends of Youth Mental Health and co-chairing the groups for cancer care and a cure, women in work, Amnesty International, the Australian Red Cross and the Hazara community. I've served on three joint parliamentary committees, including: the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Standards, which developed the first ever binding code of conduct for parliamentarians and everyone working in or visiting parliamentary workplaces; the joint standing committee overseeing the workings of the Parliamentary Library, which provides invaluable research and data to everyone in this place; and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which not only scrutinises every bill that passes through this parliament for human rights compatibility but has also held inquiries into the potential for a national human rights act and income management in our country and is currently investigating antisemitism in our universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you can believe it, I've spoken 143 times and moved 82 amendments to 19 different pieces of legislation. I can see the Leader of the House smiling as I quote those stats as many of them have been done with him. Each of those amendments was designed to improve transparency and accountability, whether that was in climate policy or for small business, to improve economic inclusion or on superannuation reform laws. In total, I have made 238 statements, including questions of government, amendments to legislation and constituency statements. But more important than numbers are the truths they reflect. I was there fighting to legislate 43 per cent emissions reductions as a floor, not a ceiling. I was there fighting for a binding code of conduct for everyone in this place and for better behaviour. I was there fighting for human rights for all. I was there fighting for HECS reform and rebates for young Australians. I was there fighting to lift the single parent payment. I was there fighting for greater protections for small and family businesses. I was there fighting for families to enable access to a home and for fairer childcare fees. I was there fighting for the best and cleanest transport for our kids, and I was there fighting for our environment. Each of these actions fundamentally helped shape the debate in this place and helped create what I hope is a new path towards consensus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my term in parliament comes to an end, I wanted to share my key take-outs in the hope that they will inspire others to choose optimism over despair. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, there is power in understanding our democracy is the direct result of our individual voting decisions and actions. If we are unhappy with the direction our country is headed in, fixing it is on us. No-one else is going to come and save us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, winning the seat of North Sydney says everything that needs to be said about exactly what one person can do. The community movement in North Sydney showed that a group of committed people, united behind a common idea, can achieve extraordinary things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, though, there is still so much work to do. While the environmental catastrophes of the 2019 and 2020 summer and the appalling treatment of women in this place were enough to drive momentum for change in 2022, the past three years have seen us continue to struggle as a nation, to find our way forward, as some have actively sought to divide and undermine our national character. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, finally, despite progress, we continue to move too slowly—too slowly to embrace the economic opportunities that come with addressing climate change; too slowly to help the most vulnerable, as more and more everyday Australians get left behind while vested interests double-down to protect their margins and the status quo; too slowly to end debates that pit us against one another, whether that is man versus woman, city versus country or those who were born here versus those who have immigrated; and too slowly to change a political dynamic which gets stuck on being so focused on maintaining short-term power that it's incredibly difficult to drive the necessary long-term reform. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we've faced significant challenges over the course of the last three years, including increasing global conflict, starting with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Iranian regime's crackdown on its citizens, the October 7 attacks in Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza. Every instance has left us shocked as we've witnessed the brutality that people have levelled against one another, with far too many innocents caught in the crossfire. Meanwhile, democracies have been under siege globally as far-right movements sweep through previously progressive societies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here at home, the campaign around the Voice referendum unveiled a schism in our society that stunned many, while more recently the rise in all forms of racism, particularly antisemitism, has created a sense that hate is boiling over. This is further reflected in the abhorrent increase in the rate of violence against women across our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Economically, many have been left feeling like they just can't get ahead, as wages have struggled to catch up with inflation, and young Australians are being left behind in the race for homeownership and long-term financial equity, drowning under levels of educational debt not previously seen in this country. Underlying it all is the increasing frequency and severity of climate disasters that see our emergency services fighting fires in one place while responding to catastrophic floods in another, with the knock-on effects driving a cost-of-living crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, these issues have translated to a significant loss of green space, as open land is sacrificed to infrastructure and greedy owners seek to increase their property value by killing trees along our foreshore, while a housing crisis has pushed essential workers and young people out of our community. It has also created challenges to our social cohesion, with various members of our community feeling increasingly unsafe, whilst worrying rates of youth mental health distress, unprecedented numbers of women and children seeking refuge from domestic abuse and more and more pensioners living in our community struggling to stay in their homes are leaving us with more people living in vulnerable situations than we've ever seen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contemplating everything I've just outlined then, I can't help but feel that we must ask ourselves: what is it that we believe in today, and what are we prepared to do to fight for those beliefs? As Robert Menzies, the father of the modern day Liberal movement himself, once said: 'It happened because we had something to believe in, not just something to oppose.' So while many of my experiences in the last three years would suggest our current political frame has sunk to a place where opposition for opposition's sake is all that matters, I have hope—hope that is driven by an understanding that any government derives its power and authority from the people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this way, democracy is not reserved or an entitlement for certain parties, groups or individuals. Rather, political equality amongst all of us means no single person's vote is any more important than another's, and that truth is not only important but must be protected. A healthy democracy requires public awareness of personal responsibility, understanding of democratic processes and, I believe, active participation. I've seen the power of that level of participation not only through our day-to-day work in our electorate but during the deliberative democracy forums I've hosted on topics as contentious as housing availability and supply, access to early childhood education and care and support for small businesses. As my Independent predecessor Ted Mack said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… government should be open to public scrutiny … elected representatives should enable people to not only participate in all decisions … but ultimately find ways to have people make decisions for themselves … a decision taken by the public as a whole will be right more often than decisions taken by an elite group …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But currently our parliament operates on the basis that, 'Because I have the numbers I am right and you are wrong,' and that is holding us back. The alternative is a democracy where Independents bring authentic community representation to this place and force conversations that are focused on building consensus across the chamber to move us forward on tax reform, forward on economic development, forward on renewable energy, forward on nature protection, forward on gender equity and forward on human rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, communities like North Sydney disrupted the system. As more and more communities announce their intention to run their own Independents in 2025 I am truly hopeful that courageous and ambitious thinking and debate will be brought back into this place. Community Independents run because their community asks them to and because they believe our democracy will be stronger if their community has a genuine voice which is heard during the political debate. On the other hand, communities send Independents because they want their parliamentary voices to be heard for their individuality in this place, not because they think they have all the answers or they think they have a greater right to be heard but because they believe that by sharing their collective experiences, opinions and ambitions they will add value to the national discourse. Unfortunately, they know that at the moment neither of the major parties are providing that level of discourse for them. They want to see a parliament that is diverse, vibrant, resilient, responsible, responsive and optimistic—a place where people listen as often as they speak and are prepared to work together to help move our nation forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I made my first speech in this place I talked about four values I believed had led me here and would guide me in my time as member for North Sydney. They were community, curiosity, compassion and courage, and they have indeed been the foundations of everything I have done. During the election of 2022 the traditional two-party system touted the rise of community Independents as a risk to stability and predictability, and we're hearing those same threats thrown around today. They argue that without party domination our parliament would descend into chaos. We've proven them wrong during this term. Rather than chaos, I believe people like me have brought a level of debate and consideration to this parliament that has not been seen since the earliest days our democracy, and that is a good thing. This parliament should serve the people, not the politics. Yet, for this to happen, people must continue to stand up, turn up and speak up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I leave this place I do so with a very deep sense of optimism that through greater community representation in parliament we can develop a deeper understanding of what it means to be Australian: to recognise and respect everybody's fundamental human rights; to get comfortable with the conversation around racism so we can recognise it, name it and act on it; to achieve true gender equity, with our expectations of appropriate behaviour and integrity modelled from the top down; and to, as a nation, fully embrace the huge economic potential that comes with no longer shying away from the challenges presented by climate change. But this will take true leadership that inspires and encourages us all to push for something better. That will need to come from a place that is grounded in compassion and courage, and to me that sounds a lot like the community Independent movement has more to offer. Extraordinary things can be achieved when we take the time to truly listen to each other, and that must be the ambition for this process and this place. It cannot just be about power and control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Doing politics differently is incredibly tough. It's isolating, sometimes overwhelming, and it requires coverage, conviction and support. In closing I want to thank the thousands of people who have helped me in this experience, and I have to preface it by saying I haven't named names, for fear of missing somebody out. To my community, to the board of Kylea Tink Independent Ltd, to the incredible volunteers, to the people who take the time to speak with me, to the advocates who turn up and reach out to me time after time, to my donors and supporters and to my friends and the wider community Independent movement, thank you for seeing what you did in me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those in parliament, the people who keep it working—the clerks, the security team, the cleaners, the gardeners, the stewards, the hosts around this house—your smiles have made every one of my days in this place better. Thank you. To my peers, colleagues in both the House of Reps and the Senate, while we've not always agreed, I've always valued the opportunity to listen to the arguments you have made and have respected the fact that progress is only possible through the open and honest exchange of ideas. Thank you for continuing to fight for what you believe in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the political leadership, especially the Speaker of the House, Milton Dick, thank you for your patience, humour and guidance. This is a crazy environment, and I'm so appreciative you were willing to help me try to make sense of it. And to the ministers in this government, thank you for being prepared to listen to my arguments and to have those conversations. I have truly enjoyed that interaction with you, and I believe you are 100 per cent committed to making this place a better place. I also want to thank the Leader of the House and the opposition's business manager. You've taught me things and I still don't think I've learnt everything, but I'm very prepared and looking forward to watching my crossbench colleagues continue to challenge you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my team, thank you for holding the line, for turning up in a way that has prioritised listening to our community, working incredibly hard to digest and critique every piece of legislation that has been presented to us and for always having my back. My trusted advisors—you know who you are—are the people who when they say no I hate it, but I listen. And when they say go, I ask you how far you need me to move. Thank you for pushing me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My family, my mum and dad—I am so grateful you have been there every moment. Thank you for wanting to protect me when I've been under attack and for reminding me that this is just another chapter in my life, not my entire story. To my brothers and sister, thank you for getting interested in politics and, again, for being there to shield and support me when vitriol was being hurled my way. To my kids, you are my world. Back in 2021, I only said yes to running because I wanted to be able to honestly say to you that I had done everything I could to leave this place better and to leave it as something you deserve. I'm actually really sorry this experience has been so disruptive for our family, but we did it together—and I think Uber has been very grateful that I've spent three years here. And for a family like ours to do something like this together, well, that's pretty bloody incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my current crossbench colleagues, you are such an extraordinary group of human beings. You are articulate, you are intelligent, you are courageous and it has been an absolute privilege to get to know each of you. To leave calling you friends is a true blessing. You've got this next election. Our country needs you, so please hold the line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, finally, to those community independents who will run in the upcoming election, including Nicolette Boele in Bradfield, if you remember nothing else, remember this: first they will ignore you, then they will laugh at you, then they will fight you, and then you will win. Go get 'em tigers! Thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Arts, Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Cyber Security, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  on indulgence—On behalf of the government, allow me to acknowledge that Kylea Tink's first speech showed an infectious enthusiasm and that that enthusiasm and optimism has been the story of this whole term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When redistributions come by, the loss that you immediately go to—it isn't as though a community won't be represented, because the communities all go somewhere. The loss that everyone was talking about immediately was the loss of Kylea Tink. What many people outside the oddness of our occupation won't appreciate is the number of changes that are made that are not in the public view. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know with legislation of my own and some briefings where, at the end, having provided a briefing of legislation I was intending to introduce, it was almost shell shock in terms of some of the responses I got sometimes. But there were changes that were made to legislation before it was introduced. The one that comes to mind immediately was a variation in how same job, same pay was done. Even though it still didn't have the support, there was a fundamental shift in how we did it because of feedback that was given by Kylea Tink because of her business background. There are changes in legislation—that story will be all across the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, I think, most importantly, beyond that, there was a change of tone, because Kylea Tink's optimism was part of the parliament. North Sydney was better served because you were here, the parliament was a better place because of your role here, and Australia is a better country because of what you've done in the 47th Parliament. So thank you for your work.</span>

It's not bad for a kid who went to Coonabarabran High School and rose to great heights. I think it's a lesson for a lot of young people in regional Australia today: to never sell themselves short, always aspire to be their best and try to make a difference in our community.</span>

You have the good fortune of spending more time with her. Unfortunately, I'm not sure whether she's a good cook or not, but Uber may suffer as a result!</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  As I said the last time we spoke on the Customs Amendment (Expedited Seizure and Disposal of Engineered Stone) Bill 2024, Joanna told me how she was going through her problems and what it meant for her and her daughter's future. She contracted silicosis while working in a quarry in Montrose, where she worked in admin and did some of the more hands-on work. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No matter where you were in the plant you would be exposed to dust. It would be all over your clothes and skin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no escaping it. There was no protection for the workers who were doing an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. She talked about how there was no information about the danger from her employer. Despite it being a multinational company, there was no education and no warning about the risk. Understandably, she talked about her anger when she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I fear this will affect my life and my family's life and I am angry. I should never have been exposed to this disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, I have been on the tail of this, writing to ministers, lobbying, working in the government for reform. I'm pleased to report that this government has not rested in our attempts to protect Australian workers and to make sure no worker is subject to the long and agonising deaths that are linked to silicosis and silica related diseases. With cooperation with states and territories, we have implemented a world-first prohibition on use, manufacture, supply, processing and installation of engineered stone benchtops, panels and slabs that cause these diseases. And this legislation does prevent greedy businesses from putting their workers at risk and into vulnerable positions to suffer the consequences of this disease, closing loopholes that put Australians at risk by prohibiting illegal importation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ban complements the government's work on Australia's domestic ban under the WHS laws, because now all engineered stone in Australia is manufactured overseas and imported. That's why the Albanese government is acting decisively to add more layers of deterrence at the border, giving Border Force more mechanisms to prevent this silent killer from slipping through the cracks and doing irreversible damage to people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regulation to enact the import prohibition is currently under development. To ensure the effectiveness of these measures, the Australian government has committed $32.1 million of funding over two years, as highlighted in the 2024-25 budget. The Customs Amendment (Expedited Seizure and Disposal of Engineered Stone) Bill 2024 is a key component required to support the proposed prohibition. The amendments in this bill would support ABF's operational effectiveness by allowing ABF officers to more efficiently administer and dispose of seized engineered stone at the border. It's building on previous policies that the Albanese Labor government has implemented to protect Australian workers, like the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill, because only a Labor government will stand up and fight for workers. Labor's commitment to ongoing industrial reform continues to be at the forefront of our agenda—something the coalition fight at every single turn. While they say they're for the Australian worker, they're really for their mates who supply the private jets and the fat wallets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change is needed not only to protect Australian workers but also to make sure our Border Force and Customs have mechanisms and processes that deal with the product that will not compromise their ability to effectively manage other priorities at our border. It's important because it's a bulk good, and the government recognises the practical challenges of management of seized engineered stone products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment seeks to combat the importation of engineered stone. This will cause an increase in the volume of seized goods required to be stored and associated work and will affect ABF's capacity to effectively regulate and administer other operations. The legislation streamlines the logistic and administrative tasks related to managing seizures for the intended new engineered-stone prohibition. It will allow for more-efficient compliance processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important factor about this legislation is that, while it will have exponential effects on health and safety conditions for workers, it is only importers who are still attempting to import engineered stone containing the crystalline silica and have the prohibited goods seized who will be affected this change. And I'd like to remind the House that this amendment we are debating today is just one of the steps we've taken to address this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July 2024 we joined with states and territories to implement the world's first prohibition of the use, manufacture, supply, processing and installation of these engineered-stone benchtops, panels and slabs in Australia. These are all steps taken by our government to reduce the rate of silicosis and related diseases, because, without the measures that our government introduced, the rates of silicosis and other respiratory diseases are unacceptably high. Back in 2023 an ABC report showed that, despite increased awareness, many Australians are still missing out on the diagnosis. The dust-borne diseases are preventable, yet it was shown that bosses, bad workplace practices and a lack of oversight were putting workers at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many young Australian workers are diagnosed with this preventable illness, and they are suffering an entirely preventable death. Dust-borne diseases impact workers from a wide range of industries: construction, manufacturing, tunnelling, mining and quarrying. Sadly, we know that the numbers will rise, given workers' exposure to a very high level of crystalline silica in the engineered-stone industry since the early 2000s. Medical experts warned that the time it takes from exposure to the time of diagnosis means the number of cases will likely increase over the next few years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Work is already being undertaken by Safe Work Australia to address silicosis. Jurisdictions have also taken immediate steps to address the increase in silicosis, including through legislative changes, development of codes of practice, education, awareness campaigns and compliance awards, and the establishment of a collaborative mechanism such as the heads of WorkSafe's working group on silicosis. This is all good work, but we need to maintain the momentum and ensure the safety of workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With all that said, let's go back to the basics of what we're talking about here. Silicosis is a lung disease mainly caused by inhaling silica, a mineral commonly found in certain rocks and soil. Silica dust is created when cutting, drilling, grinding or polishing certain types of stone, rock, sand and clay. Over time, inhaling silica dust causes inflammation, which leads to scarring of the lung tissue, which then causes stiffening of the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. Silica dust particles are 100 times smaller than a grain of sand—so small you can't see them with the naked eye. If inhaled, these particles become trapped and will cause irritation throughout the lungs, causing an irritation that the immune system cells will try to attack. The attack will be unsuccessful and cause the immune system cells to die, which then causes inflammation and scar tissue in the lungs. The development of scar tissue inhibits a person's ability to breathe, showing the signs of silicosis and, in severe cases, autoimmune disease. It's pretty clear why we need to be proactive in responding to this disease, because of the devastating and debilitating effects on workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Curtin University study shows that between 80,000 and 100,000 people may have silicosis. The Cancer Council estimates that roughly 600,000 workers have the potential for exposure each year across a wide range of industries, whether it's cutting marble for fancy benchtops or from the dust from the rocks cut in mines. Silicosis is not often diagnosed until it's in its advanced stages. Approximately 350 Australians contract silicosis each year. But, of that, around 230 people are diagnosed with the advanced prognosis. The ABC report I mentioned earlier noted that a surveillance program in New South Wales missed over 200 workers. These statistics are emblematic of why the Australian government needs to continue to be proactive in preventing engineered stone coming to our country and putting workers at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's only a Labor government that will stand up for workers. It is in stark contrast to the opposition, with a leader that consistently votes against criminalising wage theft, promises free lunch to businesses and swans around on private jets funded by the richest CEOs. It shows that the coalition simply don't understand working Australians and the challenges they face. Here, our government, the Albanese Labor government, is building Australia's future. It shows that we see the issues and that we care about protecting workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend Liam O'Brien from the ACTU for taking the time to bring people out to meet me and to tell their stories—to hear their stories and hear firsthand what it means to suffer from something that you had no idea was in the air. It's through that work of the unions, through the ACTU, that stand up and say, 'We've got to get this fixed.' They came to us, they spoke to us and we immediately swung into action to get things done, because this government believes that, when you go to work in the morning, you should go to a safe workplace and you should be able to come back home safe. With that, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this important bill, the Customs Amendment (Expedited Seizure and Disposal of Engineered Stone) Bill 2024. We're placing a few brief remarks on the record here. Senator David Shoebridge, who has been pursuing this issue for a number of years, will speak to it at more length when the matter goes to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one should have to die for a shiny benchtop. Yet, for years, manufactured stone has been silently killing young workers around the country. This deadly material is the asbestos of our time, causing incurable silicosis and destroying lives. That's why the Greens strongly welcome decisive action to ban it. For years we have backed the call from construction unions and other unions for a ban.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen firsthand the devastating toll—workers suffering slow, painful deaths and families left shattered. We've heard their pleas for action and we've fought alongside them. Greens senator David Shoebridge has been leading this fight since 2019. He was a driving force behind the New South Wales parliament review in 2020 and in a dissenting statement called for an urgent ban. As he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every month and year we delay, more workers will be exposed to the risk of deadly silicosis. No shiny benchtop is worth that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long manufacturers and developers have resisted a ban, insisting that site-specific controls were enough—just as James Hardie once did. We know from bitter experience and lives lost that these controls fail to protect workers. The only responsible solution is a total ban, yet as recently as mid-2023 SafeWork was still claiming high-silica manufactured stone could be used safely. The cost of that delay has been paid for in lives. It's time to act, because no benchtop is worth a worker's life. We strongly support the bill today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Customs Act to support the ban on the importation of manufactured stone, being an artificial product, that contains one per cent or more crystalline silica. It strengthens seizure and disposal powers to help the Australian Border Force manage manufactured and engineered stone goods at the border. Currently the act requires these prohibited imports to be stored for at least 30 days before disposal. This bill will empower the Comptroller-General of Customs to cause engineered-stone products seized as prohibited imports on and from 1 January 2025 to be dealt with as they determine appropriate, including permitting immediate destruction. This will mean engineered-stone benchtops, panels and slabs will only be able to be imported into Australia with a valid import permit or an applicable exemption. Similar provisions exist in laws for vapes, illegal tobacco and other banned products. Given the high volume of such products, retaining this storage requirement will significantly increase workload, complicate storage and transport, and hinder both the import ban and other border operations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it's critical to note that a ban needs to be just the start. We know that the young tradies who have been working with manufactured stone and get sick need quality medical support and will likely require compensation. Within Australia, we face the impossible situation that manufacturers of this product weren't able to get insurance, meaning that workers risk being stranded without compensation for the deadly disease that they are experiencing. Of course, the parallels in this country with the history of asbestos are clear, but in many ways the risks are greater from manufactured stone at the moment than they were with James Hardie because manufactured-stone producers have no production facilities or other assets in Australia to meet the claims in the absence of insurance. This means that whenever Caesarstone think it's no longer profitable to be involved in the Australian market they can cease operating, and given the lack of insurance there will be zero assets from which fabricators, tradies or home renovators with silicosis can recover damages. This needs to be avoided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, our Greens senator David Shoebridge has been calling for a ban on the use of manufactured stone, because of the risks, since 2020. As I said, he was a driving force behind the New South Wales parliament review of the product, and his dissenting statement called for an urgent banning of the product. To repeat his words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every month and year we delay, more workers will be exposed to the risk of deadly silicosis. No shiny benchtop is worth that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this legislation. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  The Australian government is committed to protecting Australian workers from harm associated with silicosis and silica related diseases. On 1 July 2024, the government joined with states and territories to implement a world-first prohibition on the use, manufacture, supply, processing and installation of engineered-stone benchtops, panels and slabs within Australia. The measure is supported and strengthened by the prohibition on the importation of engineered stone, and that was implemented on 1 January 2025. The Customs Amendment (Expedited Seizure and Disposal of Engineered Stone) Bill 2024 will amend the Customs Act 1901. The amendments in this bill are essential to supporting the effective operation of the import prohibition by enhancing existing seizure and disposal powers under the Customs Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little about the disease of silicosis because silicosis changes the lives of not only the patient but also the family, friends and the clinicians that support, treat and care for them into the future. We know that silicosis is actually a spectrum of pulmonary disease. It's caused by the inhalation of free crystalline silica, or silica dioxide. There's actually written evidence of silicon related occupational lung disease dating back to ancient Egypt and ancient Greece. There's been documented evidence and information relating to this disease for quite some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The clinical presentations of silicosis, the diagnostic work-up, the evaluation and the pulmonary disability that occurs with silicosis actually has quite the spectrum. You've got acute silicosis on one end, which is that hyperrealisation of symptoms, including dyspnoea—shortness of breath, particularly at rest. You could have pleuritic pain—pain around the chest and lungs. You can have haemoptysis—the coughing up of blood—as well as fevers and the like. All of those can range from acute to chronic silicosis, and it can actually occur from hours to days after exposure to silica, as well as up to multiple decades after exposure. You might be exposed to it at one point and then you won't know, or you won't present to the doctor, until many years later, which is what makes this such a dangerous thing in our society. Those in the occupations who are on-site with the tradies won't necessarily know that they've become unwell. It's not until they present late at night coughing up blood with chest pain, or they go to their GP because they've got this intractable fatigue that they just can't get rid of, or weight loss, that they are diagnosed. It really, really is a dangerous pathology. This customs amendment goes to the heart of it. The more that we can control this issue and stop it from hitting our society, the better and healthier we will all be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've gone through the spectrum of what silicosis is—the acute, the chronic and the like—but there are other complications that can actually be associated with silicosis, along with the other pneumoconioses too, which are the other occupational lung diseases. In particular, with silicosis you've got an increased risk of things like microbacterial infection, chronic necrotising aspergillosis, lung cancer, rheumatic disorders, kidney disease, chronic airflow obstruction and chronic bronchitis. Going through some of these things, there's not only a cost to the patient but also a cost to the healthcare system. When someone develops pulmonary renal syndrome, where the lungs are failing because of silicosis, and then the kidneys begin failing—is that person then going to end up on dialysis? Is that person going to need renal replacement therapy? That's a huge medical intervention that people require. That involves staffing, dialysis machines and access to tertiary medical services in some instances. That can have a huge impact on our country and our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is chronic airflow obstruction and chronic bronchitis. We hear these terms thrown around when we talk about pulmonary diseases in the community, but, looking at what some of these things mean—chronic airflow obstruction and chronic bronchitis—we're talking about an inflammation of our airwaves. Eventually the end stage of this disease, if it either is untreated or cannot be treated, is essentially suffocation. You stop taking in air. You stop changing over that carbon dioxide to the oxygen that you need in your cells to live, and, at the end of the day, you will eventually suffocate to death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making sure that we control this silica and that we rid it from our society is so important because people have died from this. No doubt people will die from this in the future, which is an absolute tragedy. But we need to prevent it. That's what Labor governments do. We do this sort of reform. It doesn't matter whether it's here with silicosis and silica or when we look at things like asbestos; bulk-billing, universal health care and access to those health services that every Australian requires—it's really only this side of the House that has the wherewithal and the gumption to get that done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two outstanding health professionals and parliamentarians that are sitting here in the chamber now: Assistant Minister Kearney and the member for Macarthur, Dr Mike Freelander. They've always been champions of our universal health system and making sure that patients can get access to the treatment that they deserve. It's absolutely outstanding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's another thing that I wanted to run through with silicosis, and that's the link of chronic silica exposure to other diseases, which is a bit of a lesser-known aspect. Some links are stronger than others, but it is important, I think, to bring up. An example is rheumatic heart disease. We know that silicosis as a condition is associated with the production of autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor, which is interesting. You normally associate those types of autoantibodies, those circulating chemicals in the blood, with autoimmune diseases—things like lupus, discoid lupus, systemic lupus, erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases—but you wouldn't necessarily associate them with silica exposure. That's an area that absolutely needs a lot more research, but it's an interesting link to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke about chronic kidney disease before. With silica exposure, that airflow limitation can contribute to chronic bronchitis as well, and also to early lung malignancy and lung cancer. They're just some other conditions that have been associated with chronic silica exposure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Outside of those health related changes that are absolutely essential and need to be made in order to prevent silica exposure, why else is this change needed? As engineered stone products are a bulk good, management of seized engineered stone products at the border poses significant challenges in terms of storage, transport, disposal and administration. Managing engineered stone as a prohibited import without this amendment may result in a significant increase in the volume of seized goods that are required to be stored and an increase in associated work at the border. That will impact the Australian Border Force's capacity to effectively regulate and administer other border operations and protect Australians, at the end of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Streamlining the logistics and administrative tasks related to managing seizures for the intended new engineered stone prohibition will allow for a more efficient compliance process, resulting in the Australian Border Force having an increased ability to allocate resources across those priority areas. This isn't just another example of the Australian Labor Party strengthening health care and strengthening the rights of workers; this is also making sure that we're streamlining our administrative processes to make it easier for our Public Service to operate and make our community safer for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question that gets asked is, 'Can engineered stone still be imported?' The import ban is intended to complement the domestic ban under the WHS laws, as I said before. Almost all engineered stone in Australia is manufactured overseas and imported. The import ban will provide an additional layer of deterrence at the border. Regulations to enact the import prohibition are currently under development, with funding of $32.1 million over two years provided in the 2024-25 budget for the ABF to enforce the intended import prohibition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've gone through what silicosis is, how it's caused and what this bill means, but, again, as I was saying, it strengthens the health care of Australians and it goes to the heart of what this side of the House is all about—that is, ensuring that the health care of all Australians is accessible, affordable and equitable. I've spoken today in a private member's motion about strengthening Medicare and the tripling of the bulk billing incentive. In Robertson, we've seen tens of thousands of people able to access a bulk billed GP for the first time in years. We saw the opposition today in question time spruiking numbers of falling bulk billing rates, which was absolute rubbish. We know that bulk billing rates are on the rise—they are in Robertson, and they are in other parts of the country. This is in association with our cheaper medicines legislation, making sure that people can access PBS medications when they need it and where they need it—</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Member for Macarthur! That's whether they are blood thinners, diabetic medications or inhalers. These medications are important not only to sustain life but also to ensure that there are no other exacerbations of these chronic illnesses so that patients don't end up in the emergency department.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also the recent announcement regarding women's health—an absolutely outstanding announcement, a tremendous announcement, from the assistant minister and from the minister for health, looking at ensuring women's access to contraceptive devices and pharmaceuticals, and to clinics that can help diagnose, evaluate and then go on to treat things like endometriosis and chronic pain. Also, as to contraceptive access, I think it is absolutely outstanding and really should be commended, because, at the end of the day, whether you work in health care or whether you have the honour to serve in this chamber, you want equitable access for all Australians, and that's exactly what this does.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely fantastic that, later next week, in my electorate of Robertson, we'll be holding a women's health forum—the second Central Coast Women's Health Forum, in fact. It'll be at the Impact gym at Erina, starting at 5.30; RSVP through my office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first women's health forum gave women on the Central Coast a place where they could talk openly and safely about the issues that are affecting them, particularly with access to health care. That's what this second forum is about. It's about ensuring that I, alongside the assistant minister, can provide information on what the government is doing with regard to women's health care. It's also about making sure that women on the Central Coast can have their say about what they would like to see, whether that's access to primary care, access to pharmaceuticals or access to the new schemes for our pharmacies as to the treatment of UTIs and the provision of oral contraception.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That expanded scope of practice and making sure that all of our clinicians across Australia are working at the top of their scope is absolutely paramount, because that way Australians will be getting the care they need when they need it. The forum will be a great chance for people to have their say about that and really nail down those details to what that means every day. It means that you won't have to go to the doctor as frequently. I guarantee you: our GPs in the community will not be short of work! Patients will be able to go to the pharmacy and get the treatment they need, or go to the GP and get the treatment they need, or, if they are really unwell, come and see me at the hospital in the middle of night. You'll be able to get the care that you need when you need it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Really, it is only the Australian Labor Party, under the Albanese Labor government, with a terrific team of ministers and assistant ministers, and the great caucus that we are, that has made this possible, because, without the election of the Labor government in 2022, none of this would have happened. I guarantee you: bulk-billing would have been abolished. There would have been an ED entry fee. A GP tax would have been introduced. We'd be paying—</span>

                    </a>  That's exactly right; we'd be paying more for medications. As we know, the Leader of the Opposition was voted the worst health minister by Australian doctors, and he ripped tens of billions from our public health system. And that has repercussions. That has effects and flow-on effects over years. That means underresourced hospitals; that means understaffed hospitals—all because the Leader of the Opposition didn't have the gumption and the commitment to serve the Australian people and ensure the health care of every Australian citizen right across this country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  I will be on task shortly, but just let me reinforce what the member for Robertson has just said. Health care is in the DNA of the Australian Labor Party. We recognise that healthy people are productive people. We recognise that there is an equity issue about health care. And Australia has led the world in equitable access to health care. We've heard about the Leader of the Opposition and what he did to health care. Basically, he wanted to destroy bulk-billing, to destroy people's ability to equitably access health care and to make sure that only the wealthy could afford access to health care in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the Leader of the Opposition; don't forget what Jeff Kennett did to the Victorian health system decades ago—an absolute tragedy. Unfortunately, we now have the Liberal Party in a similar position; they want to cut health care. It really concerns me that we still have no health policy coming from the Leader of the Opposition or his health spokesperson. They've agreed to follow our women's healthcare plan but only after much prodding. There is nothing coming forward initiating healthcare policy. It is very poor.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the Customs Amendment (Expedited Seizure and Disposal of Engineered Stone) Bill, this is a very important bill. First of all, let me congratulate the government on banning the use of engineered stone in Australia. That was a really important change. It's something that was long overdue. Our government did that very quickly to make sure that Australian workers go home healthy every day—yet another thing we've done to promote equitable access to health care, and that's on an occupational basis. This bill is a follow-on from that to prevent the importation of engineered stone where it could have been used without any oversight. This is a very important follow-on from that initial banning of the use of engineered stone.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can take a step back, I'll tell you my experience as a young resident. We used to go into the respiratory wards, when I did a respiratory term, and we'd see people who were pretty fit, middle-aged men. These were people that were used to manual labour either as coalminers or as industrial workers. They were fit, very strong men, and they were basically suffocating from an entirely preventable lung disease. Silicosis is preventable, yet we were seeing numbers of previously healthy, strong men dying from this disease—and it's a slow death. It's not a good death, if any death is good; it's a slow, suffocating death—with them often carrying around their oxygen cylinders—from a preventable cause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia led the world in the prevention of silicosis and related diseases in coalminers and industrial workers. We had the Dust Diseases Board, which was important, to make sure that workers were protected from developing coalminers' lung or silicosis and other complications of lung disease like asbestos and mesothelioma. Initially the major concern was asbestos, but it was recognised that silicosis could develop in many different coalmines and others from the unregulated inhalation of silica dust—sometimes with coal dust but sometimes with asbestos as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Dust Diseases Board was a huge innovation, and my cousin, Julian Lee, a respiratory physician at the Woolcock Institute at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, was one of the leading physicians on the Dust Diseases Board. He always felt that governments had been very late in introducing regulations to prevent the development of this terrible lung disease—not just asbestosis but silicosis. There were large numbers of people in the coalmining industry and other mining industries and the tunnelling industry—and in industrial uses and, more lately, in the use of stone for benchtops et cetera—that had been exposed to silica dust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember meeting in my office a couple of years ago a well-known rugby league football player and industrial worker, Ray, who developed silicosis. He was a big, strong, muscular guy but breathing in grunting respirations—that's how they breathe. They breathe to try and keep their little air sacs open so they can get oxygen that they need into their lungs, and it's really terrifying to see these previously fit and healthy strong men basically suffocating in front of your eyes. I believe that subsequently he has gone on to now needing home oxygen, a really terrible end result from what was an entirely preventable disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The silicosis occurs because you can't see and you can't feel the silica dust, so people are inhaling it into their lungs without knowledge. These tiny little silica particles are gobbled up by the little protective cells we all have in our lungs called macrophages, but once they enter those macrophages the silica itself sets up an inflammatory process. That inflammatory process then leads to the immune system attacking it, causing scarring. What happens is that scarring gradually shrinks the elastic ability of the little lung tissues to open up with every breath and get that oxygen out of the air we breathe, and gradually the lungs get stiffer and stiffer, the little air sacs get destroyed and people find it more and more difficult to breathe. They help themselves by giving themselves end-airway pressure by the grunting respirations that keep the air sacs open, but, unfortunately, people can develop this without recognising it because our lungs have an ability to compensate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They can often at presentation already have untreatable chronic lung disease, and there are no really effective treatments other than supportive treatments. Use of steroids or use of drugs, such as those used in asthma, to open up the airways have a very limited effect, and very quickly people with silicosis become oxygen dependent. You can see them. They're otherwise healthy looking blokes, grunting respiration, walking around with tubes in their nose delivering the oxygen they often carry in a backpack or a trolley to help them move around. Eventually they will die of respiratory failure if they don't get a heart and lung transplant. Even with that, results can be difficult because, as we've already heard, the complications of silicosis include things like heart disease and autoimmune disease because the inflammatory process releases proteins into the blood that cause your body's own immune system to attack other organs, so people can have renal kidney failure and they can have other autoimmune disorders. It is a tragic complication of the disease of silicosis that not just the lungs are affected, and people die when they really should have many more years to live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party believes people should have the opportunity of going to work and coming home healthy, hence our moves initially to ban the importation of engineered stone and now to seize engineered stone at the border and to dispose of it quickly without it getting into the system, where it could be used dishonestly otherwise. This legislation is very important, but it's also a continuum of Labor looking after people and looking after workers in particular. As a physician, these are dreadful diseases that could have been prevented. We're still seeing people in this day and age suffering from silicosis, and that just should not be happening. Engineered stone is a particular danger because of the very high concentrations of silica in engineered stone, sometimes up to 80 per cent, whereas natural stone, even though it's not without risk, has usually 20 per cent or lower silica. It's very important that we don't use engineered stone. Unfortunately, as my cousin Julian Lee thought about asbestos diseases and coalminer's lung and silicosis, we are late in doing it. It should have been done years ago. We're very lucky that we've got a Labor government who's prepared to act on this quite dreadful disease and make sure that workers go to work and come home healthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've prohibited other imports before—vapes being one of them. That's a particular interest of mine. We should've banned the importation of vapes years and years ago. We've had to introduce legislation to prevent the use and importation of vapes, and we're now doing the same thing with engineered stone, which is very important. It's part of a suite of public health measures that Labor is committed to. This Customs Amendment (Expedited Seizure and Disposal of Engineered Stone) Bill is a really key component of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we have this bill because other seized products have to be kept and stored for a while as the legal process needs to happen so they can be destroyed. But engineered stone is very heavy. It's difficult to store; it's difficult to manage. This bill now gives the government and the authorities the ability to immediately remove any possibility of the engineered stone getting to market. Immediate destruction is the best answer for this, and this bill ensures that this will happen. It's yet another public health measure, as I've said, that prevents workers from becoming unwell and makes sure that they can go home safely every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people have previously suggested that more needs to be done to educate workers about the dangers of engineered stone and that more needs to be done to make sure that workers wear masks and gloves et cetera. But, in a workplace that may only be small or is isolated, it's very difficult to make sure that 100 per cent of the safety measures are undertaken, and so the best result is going to be what has happened—that is, the banning of the use of engineered stone altogether and the destruction of any engineered stone that gets to Australia. It means that we are able to destroy it immediately before any possibility of use, legal or otherwise, and that it can be destroyed very quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House. There is, of course, more to be done. We certainly need to be doing more in terms of educating miners and workers about the dangers of inhaling particles, not just silica but also particles from other forms of mining. We've done our very best to make sure people are protected from the dangers of asbestos disease, but it's important to note that we still have quite a significant amount of asbestos in our housing stock. People need to be made aware of the dangers of asbestosis and inhalation of asbestos, not just in our working community but for homeowners, and Labor is committed to doing that. This needs to be done together with people who are involved in the tunnelling industry, as my eldest son is. There are dangers such as dust inhalation in tunnelling situations, particularly if attention to protective equipment is not followed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's much more to be done for public health measures. This bill and the one previously that banned the use of engineered stone are fantastic protections for Australian workers. Only Labor has been able to do this. The previous government ignored the problem, and it's very important that our good work in public health continues.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  I rise as well to speak in favour of the bill that's before us, the Customs Amendment (Expedited Seizure and Disposal of Engineered Stone) Bill 2024. I note that I rise to speak after two members whose careers before entering this place, which continue whilst they're here, are in the health profession. They, like the entire health community, know of the dangers of silicosis and silica related diseases that are the result of workers and homeowners who might be working with engineered stone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When our state governments around Australia came together in this place to ban engineered stone, the recognition was that we did not want engineered stone to become the new asbestos. I would say that, in a very real way, the medical profession, the unions—the experts—were not listened to when it came to asbestos. After a very long community campaign, eventually we did ban asbestos in this country, and we are now working and living with the legacy of that ban.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over a third of Australian homes have asbestos in them, and the rate of death in relation to asbestosis and asbestos related diseases continues to be above 6,000 a year—too many for a product that people put into their homes during a particular period. It is a legacy that we continue to live with, and it is expected that the death rate will increase, unfortunately, because we still have so much asbestos in our built community. Our government, like previous governments, is working with the states and territories on how best to remove asbestos, when to remove it—whether it be heat maps and whether it be working with the real estate agents or with the building industry—to make sure it is removed as safely and as effectively as possible. Public buildings, schools, hospitals, homes—you name it—asbestos is almost everywhere. As I said, it is in a third of homes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the issues first started to arise in relation to engineered stone, the medical profession, the experts within those fields of research and the union movement did not wait to say, 'Look, we might need to address this.' It soon became a campaign to ban engineered stone. I was very pleased to be in a government that worked with states and territories to introduce that ban.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has committed to protecting Australian workers from the harm associated with silicosis and silica related disease. That's why, as I said, on 1 July 2020, the government joined with states and territories to implement world's first ban on the use, manufacture, supply, processing and installation of engineered stone benchtop panels and slabs in Australia. We didn't say, 'Let's drill it with water,' or try a separate way. The research was in, the evidence was in, and we needed to go for a straight ban. This measure that we have before us now supports and strengthens that prohibition on importing engineered stone that was implemented on 1 January 2025. This bill amends the act to say that where Border Force and officials come across the stone it can be seized and destroyed immediately. Similar provisions already exists for other prohibited imports, such as tobacco, vapes, dangerous perishable goods and illicit drugs. It is the easiest way to dispose of this product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that engineered stone, used in benchtops and in home building, is a big bulky product, so by destroying it straightaway it does not take up space. There is no room for appeals, denials, negotiations. It is imported, it is discovered, it is confiscated, it is seized and it is destroyed. This adds an extra layer of deterrence to those who might try and sneak the product in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know with the asbestos example, it doesn't stop countries or importers from trying to sneak it in. I've lost count of the number of times that our Border Force officials have found asbestos in products being imported into Australia. Whether it is deliberate or unintentional, asbestos is still finding its way into our country, and Border Force officials are working really hard to stop that from happening. It has been found in car tyres, children's crayons and building materials where things have been labelled wrongly. So this bill before us says that, in cases where it is discovered, it will be destroyed immediately. It is important that we have these protections in place to ensure that this dangerous stone is destroyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Managing engineered stone as a prohibited import without this amendment would result in a significant increase of these goods having to be stored and also an increase in the associated work that Border Force would have to do to regulate and administrate the management of it after being seized when those resources could be used elsewhere. Who is most affected by this change? Only the importers that are still attempting to bring in engineered stone when they are not supposed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous speakers have spoken about the nature of this product. Talking to builders and workers in my electorate and to people associated with the building trade, it is essentially a bunch of crap. It's a whole bunch of things slapped together in a slab, sold as fake marble, trying to convince homeowners they can still have a marble finish but with a product that is not marble. It is used in homes to sell a finish that it is not. What we know from the workers, their unions and health professionals is that the cutting of this stone and the concentration of silica and silica dust coming from this stone is what is creating a high level of disease amongst their workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ban means engineered stone cannot be imported whatsoever. Almost all engineered stone in Australia is manufactured overseas and imported. An import ban provides an additional layer of deterrence at the border, stopping this stone from coming in. I should also say that this is a relatively new product, so it is not like asbestos, where we had decades and generations of legacy product in our built environment. It's a relatively new product, so it means that the number of homes and buildings with this product is a lot smaller than the challenge that we face with asbestos. But that stage of the campaign will come next. How do we then make sure that we are tracking where the stone is so that people who may have purchased a home with it know that if they want to do any work on that home they have to handle that stone product with care. If it is in a benchtop, you are not going to have as much interaction with it as, say, a wall you might be sanding to repaint where you have asbestos. The risk is reduced because it's in the home and it has one purpose. However, it is important that people know, if they have purchased a home with this fake marble, this engineered stone, how best to manage it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the ban necessary? I've touched on this briefly, but I want to end on this point. It is because workers were dying. We all remember the heartbreaking stories in our media of young families being ripped apart as workers and their families were receiving this diagnosis of silicosis. Exposure to silica dust is a health hazard for workers who manufacture, finish and install natural and engineered-stone countertop products. But what we know is that engineered stone has a higher risk of exposure because of the nature of the product. In some states reports have shown that one in four stonemasons who've work with engineered stone are being diagnosed with silicosis. It is unacceptable. That's why we had to bring this ban in, and that's why we are now amending it to see that the stone is destroyed as soon as it's discovered. Scientific and medical evidence has found that even when workers cut and fabricate low-silica stone product it generates significant amounts of very fine particles of silica that can then penetrate deep into the lungs, causing the disease, as my colleague pointed out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of the ban there was overwhelming relief and support from many in the medical profession and the research profession, as well as the union movement. At the time, the ACTU assistant secretary, Liam O'Brien, said that a total ban would 'save lives'. He said, 'We thank the ministers for putting workers' lives ahead of corporate profits.' Another said that engineered stone was a fashion product that was killing workers who made it. And that's the point: it was a fashion product; it was a building choice. There are other choices that we can make for our benchtops in our homes, in our units, in our workplaces. Alternatives are readily available, and we should be choosing those ahead of a product that we know puts tradies' lives at risk for fashion in our kitchens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know from the research—and this is one of the key reasons we pushed for this ban—that there is no such thing as safe engineered stone. There is no safety measure that can be put in place to eliminate the risk and the aggressive lung disease. That is why the ban was necessary. A total ban is the only sensible option. Every day that passed prior to the ban coming in was costing lives. So this bill that we have before us strengthens the ban by requiring that Australian Border Force destroy the product the moment it is detected and intercepted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is unfinished business, and something our government is up for, and I want to make a few final comments before I finish. We need to continue the investment and the research into the health care of people with silicosis and, equally, people who might have been exposed to asbestos and have an asbestos related disease, like asbestosis or mesothelioma. There is more work to be done for us to support the healthcare research and to ensure that we have nurses and skilled health professionals to support those who might have been diagnosed with these diseases. The mortality rates of people who have silicosis, asbestosis or mesothelioma are far too high. And, as with previous cancers, where, as a government, as a community and as a research fraternity we have invested to improve the health outcomes of people who contract disease, we need to do something similar in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For people who've been diagnosed with breast cancer, the survival rate is now much, much higher. For people who've been diagnosed with melanoma, survival rates are much, much higher. We need to see that investment come into this space as well, because this is a completely preventable disease. This is based upon workers contracting this disease through going to work. So these reforms that are before us—the banning of this product—are very much in line with Labor's fundamental belief that every worker should come home safe at the end of the day. It is not just about being exposed at work to hazardous risks of an immediate danger but also about being exposed to an ongoing risk. That is why these bills are so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've touched briefly on asbestosis, which I think is an area related to this, and that's why I welcome the government's decision to expand the role of the Asbestos Eradication Agency to include dust related diseases, because, as I've mentioned, we now have a legacy issue. This stone does exist in our community—not to the extent of asbestos, but it is there. It is in people's kitchens, whether that be their workplace or their home, and we need to keep track of that. We also need to make sure we're developing guidelines on how best to manage that risk that people now have in their home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, can I give a shout-out and a special mention to all the young workers who have contracted silicosis through their work and say that we are all thinking of you and your families in your battle ahead. Your legacy will be to ensure that no other worker on an Australian construction site will be exposed to this disease, which leads to such terrible and tragic outcomes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Who knows? This could be the last week before the election—or we might have a few more sitting weeks; that's up to the Prime Minister. But we are definitely heading to an election soon, and I would like to reflect, in the time I have, on what a privilege it's been to represent the people of Nicholls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was elected at the 2022 election along with the member for Menzies, who, might I say, has made an outstanding contribution to this place. It's such an honour to represent an electorate like Nicholls for all of the good things it does for the nation. They're great businesses like SPC, all the dairy manufacturing businesses, food processing, the manufacturing, the farming—all of the things that happen in Nicholls are what's good about Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've tried to have a real grassroots engagement with my constituents, and that itself has been a privilege. I set out on a mission to train with all 44 football and netball clubs in my electorate. I am only eight clubs off achieving that, and I hope to go to the election saying I trained with them all. The training has been fun, and fitness is good, but it's just engaging with young people—particularly young people who are involved in football and netball clubs—and listening to what sorts of industries they're involved with, what is working for them and what isn't working for them that has been a great lesson for me, and it's informed a lot of what I've done up here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big successes can be had, and we can make people's lives better and their jobs more secure and their communities more prosperous, and I've seen that happen. But where I've seen it happen for my electorate and for Australia is with the ethos of the coalition and the focus of the Nationals. And I think, right now, Australia is not going in the right direction. Our economy is suffering, our energy future is in serious doubt, and the tools that the entrepreneurs of Australia need to thrive, be profitable and, most importantly, employ people are being taken away from them—not to mention the social cohesion, and I thought that was something that was ingrained in Australia and that we'd never lose. I've seen that fray over the last 2½ years to my great regret, because it's the country I love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Countries do really well when they set up a framework for private enterprise to thrive, and I don't think we have that framework at the moment. I think we've got a government trying to control everything, with an ideological bent. And, unfortunately for our nation, that ideology is being mugged by scientific engineering and economic reality. I really hope we can form government, because Australia needs to get back on track. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals in government will put agriculture back at the focus of this nation and give farmers the tools they need to grow food for our country and for the world. We will ensure that the Murray-Darling Basin communities can continue to irrigate crops and process food, all the while still caring for the river system. People who live in the basin communities understand how to care for the river system, as distinct from bureaucrats who try and run it from Canberra. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals, in a coalition government, will also build infrastructure, and I know that we will because we've done it before. In my community, we've seen the Echuca-Moama bridge built by the coalition in state and federal governments, and that's changed the lives of many people and many businesses in that community. It's also evidenced by the Shepparton rail upgrade, which is going to see nine return services from Shepparton to Melbourne—an initiative funded by the coalition. Again, it's something that makes people's lives better. And it can happen when you've got the budget in balance. And it can happen when you've got industries that are thriving and taxes that can be paid so that we can pay for these things that we all want—the infrastructure, the hospitals and the education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Australia, Victoria and Nicholls need to get back on track, and I think a coalition government can achieve this. I really look forward to continuing to move around my community, whether it be on the football field, on the netball court, in the clubrooms afterwards, on the street, walking into the private businesses of Nicholls or going through the schools and just talking to people about the Australia they believe in, the Australia they want: do they want the entrepreneurial Australia, the have-a-go Australia, the Australia that's focused on the fair go and the free market, or do they want this rigid control that we seem to be having?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  They might say that diamonds are a girl's best friend, but I am an aluminium woman. It is interesting how themes run through your life. Aluminium does have a very special place in my heart. When I was just 14, I won a scholarship to live in northern England. It was sponsored by Cessnock City Council, our local council, and Alcan, which ran the smelter in Kurri Kurri. I lived with a wonderful English family. I went to school there and I visited British Alcan in Lynemouth many times as part of my scholarship. I learned a lot about how aluminium was made and its importance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a big deal for a kid from Heddon Greta who hadn't really travelled the world at all. Fast forward 40 years and I now represent Tomago, and Tomago is the home of Tomago Aluminium. Tomago is located pretty much right in the heart of my electorate of Paterson. Tomago operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year producing 37 per cent of Australia's primary aluminium.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aluminium is our fifth-largest export commodity. Tomago Aluminium is pivotal to that export. A thousand-plus people work at Tomago, plus 200 contractors, and indirectly around 5,000 local people depend on Tomago Aluminium. Across the country 13,000 people depend on the smelting of aluminium in our country. But it's bigger than that, and aluminium is bigger than wrapping up the leftover sausages from a Saturday barbecue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aluminium is the future. It is in everyday products like the solar panels on our roofs. It is in our smart phones. Pretty much everyone in this place has a piece of my electorate in their phone, I'm guessing, because the aluminium that goes into these smart phones comes largely from Tomago Aluminium. It is in our military aircraft and our naval vessels. It is in specialised equipment. It is a key industry that's also forming our renewable future. It is part of electric vehicles, and it is certainly important in batteries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no facet of modern life that aluminium doesn't touch. That's why I am so pleased to say that our government, the Albanese Labor government, is backing aluminium in Australia. The Prime Minister came to my electorate a couple of weeks ago to make a $2 billion—billion with a 'b'—aluminium announcement. It is an aluminium production incentive and it's going to ensure investment in this industry is secure. And this $2 billion investment in the aluminium industry right across Australia is going to ensure the jobs of aluminium workers in seats like mine and in places like Tomago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't be prouder to back in those workers. I know what it's like to go into those potlines. I haven't worked in a potline, but I've spent a lot of time in potlines. They are hot; they are places where you're breathing air that has lots of things in it. Basically, it's really hard work to work in an aluminium smelter, but it's critical work. It's work that we need Australians to be doing. They're good, well-paid jobs; they're smart jobs, and we must continue to support those workers and their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other interesting part about this big announcement is that it's going to back in this critical metal into the future. When we talk about a future made in Australia, and you hear that talked about a lot here, this is what this is. It's backing in our manufacturing. We learnt during COVID that we'd stopped making a lot of things. I know that the previous government and governments before have treated our manufacturing industry very poorly. This government is backing in manufacturing. It's backing in industries like the aluminium industry. It's backing in Tomago Aluminium. That's what a future made in Australia really means when we talk about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got this plan to back in local manufacturing and local jobs and to invest in the future. Tomago Aluminium wants to run on renewable energy, but it's going to take some time. This $2 billion incentive is going to help bridge that gap. I back it every day of the week, and I back the jobs of aluminium workers and Tomago Aluminium.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286535" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise today to provide a brief brief on the major flooding events happening in the north of Australia at this present point in time. We are now in the recovery phase, although I'm asking everybody to please still be careful, because there is some more rain forecast for the next day or so. I would like to give a big special mention to the disaster management teams—the local disaster management groups of Mackay, Whitsunday, Burdekin and Townsville—who have kept our people safe and kept the whole event organised. I'd also like to give a big shout-out to the first responders—the police, fire and ambulance. The job they have been doing is second to none. To our SES workers: well done to those guys and girls. And last but not least, there is the community. The community has bonded together. It's what we do in north Queensland. We look after our mates. We get together, and we make sure the elderly, our neighbours and everyone in the whole area is okay, so well done to the community. It's very fortunate that in my electorate we had no loss of life. Unfortunately, a little bit further north, there were fatalities, and my thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families at this very difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After we could start to move around, I started to travel to the smaller towns. My first stop was Gumlu, and I caught up with the kids at the Gumlu school, some of the parents and teachers, and some farmers just to see how they had fared. Unfortunately, some of the farms are not going so well. Then I was off to Giru. Quite a bit of floodwater went through houses and businesses in Giru. I met Zoe, a pocket rocket. She has a black belt in karate, and she was mopping out her hairdressing salon. I hope you get back up and running as soon as you can, Zoe. There was a car collector there, and he had a lot of cars go under. The post office and the corner store had water through them, so that wasn't very good at all, but they are a very resilient community in Giru, and they got straight back on with the job. At Cungulla, they had water in houses and everything, including some of their community assets. The little community of Nome had a lot of fences and outdoor areas breached. Some of my major concerns are the sewage within the area, particularly around the septic tanks and those sorts of things, which is now floating around the yards—please be careful!—and also the damage to farms. We need to make sure that we keep an eye on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this event has highlighted is the poor state of the Bruce Highway. In my electorate alone, the highway was blocked at Goorganga Plains. The previous coalition government provided $10 million to go towards working out a plan to fix that. Unfortunately, the state Labor government sat on that, so nothing happened. It was blocked there. A T-section on the Bruce Highway at Hamilton Plains was blocked. Myrtle Creek was blocked. Albeitz Road, or 'Peter's Flats' as the locals call it, was blocked. Wangaratta Creek was blocked. Plantation Creek was blocked, and it's still blocked today, but, thankfully, some heavy vehicles are being allowed through. It was blocked at Barratta and at Alligator Creek.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is simply not good enough. This is how we get our supplies up from the city. It's how we get our produce to market, and it is how our families get around safely. To have all these blockages is not acceptable. It just goes to show that the Back Our Bruce campaign, which I have been running and which has been supported by all my federal compadres up and down the Bruce Highway, is certainly warranted. I am extremely concerned about the number of potholes. There is a conga line of potholes. If you could work out a way of putting a roof over those potholes, we could solve some of the Labor created housing crisis that we're experiencing at the present point in time. The other thing about potholes that I am worried about is people swerving and potentially running into incoming traffic. We desperately need some of the $7.2 billion announced by this government. Thank you, Mr Albanese, for that. It has been matched by the opposition. It's very important that this money doesn't all get spent down in the south-east corner. It needs to come into my electorate of Dawson and do some good where it is needed the most.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Victories as a local member come in all sizes, big and small. The small victories are just as important as the large ones, such as helping someone with Services Australia, the NDIS or a visa. But then there are also the big victories—those that impact entire communities, suburbs and regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken many times in the chamber about the rapid, unprecedented growth in my electorate. In many parts of the electorate, where fields and market gardens existed just a few years ago, there are now houses and growing communities. Paddocks have been replaced by rows of houses. Despite this growth, the provision of infrastructure, especially the upgrading of roads, has been woefully inadequate. The truth is there have been improvements in local public transport, such as a 2,000-space car park at Edmondson Park railway station. Getting this car park built was a community campaign over years with my colleague the member for Macquarie Fields.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of a road not fit for purpose is Fifteenth Avenue at Hoxton Park. This thoroughfare, because you can barely call it a road, has been left in the too-hard basket for years by successive Liberal governments at both state and federal levels. Ostensively a rural road, it is no longer fit for purpose given the growth of Austral and the new housing built over the last decade. It is seriously a disgrace in terms of both its condition and provision for tens of thousands of cars that use it every day. Everyday road users are stuck in traffic jams, resulting in massive disruptions to the lives of thousands of people and millions of dollars lost to the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The need to upgrade Fifteenth Avenue has been known for years. I know that because it was an issue I started working on as a councillor more than 12 years ago. The council's expenditure of $100,000 for an external lobbyist just before the recent council election did not get the commitment over the line. What did was meticulous data and, as the New South Wales Premier put it, 'being a pain', but, more importantly, it was federal and state Labor government members who value and respect their community. The council petition, active for several months, fell short of its 20,000 signature target by 18,000 signatures. Despite my constant campaigning over 12 years, successive Liberal governments have ignored our community even after they announced the Western Sydney airport, and Liverpool City Council has been ineffectual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, those days are over. While the Liberals procrastinate, ignore and deflect, Labor delivers. It was my honour on 19 January to host the Prime Minister, New South Wales Premier, New South Wales Minister for Infrastructure and other New South Wales ministers to announce a joint federal and state government funding agreement of $1 billion for Fifteenth Avenue. Let me be specific, this is not a promise to upgrade the road; it is a guaranteed commitment from the budget and it will happen. The announcement that a Liberal opposition will match Labor's announcement is nonsense. Labor understands the needs of Western and south-western Sydney. We understand the commute; we understand the distances between home and work, home and shopping, and home and leisure. We really do get the importance of a well-functioning road network, and I understand because I've lived there all my life and I learned to drive on this road. If the $1 billion upgrade of Fifteenth Avenue isn't enough proof of Labor's commitments to our local roads, it is on top of the $19.3 billion Western Sydney roads package that was announced in the last budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 22,000 vehicles travel along the congested Fifteenth Avenue every day, with eight per cent of those being trucks. By 2041, it is estimated that an additional 63,000 people will be living in the area. So not only is the upgrade of the road good news for now but it also future proofs it for our future residents, and the benefits for improving the connectivity with the Western Sydney airport are obvious. I genuinely thank the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier and Minister for Infrastructure for their support for my campaign. It is yet further proof that, far from forgetting the south-west, it is forefront and foremost in the minds of our government both at federal and state levels, and, more importantly, the funding is in their budgets.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  There are over 1.4 million Australians of Chinese heritage, and we have recently seen the culmination of the lunar new year festival period, also known as spring festival or Chinese new year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the electorate in this place that, on the new boundaries, will have the largest Chinese diaspora—at 29 per cent in the census—I want to say how grateful I am to represent this community and also how much I enjoy attending so many festivals in the community. This is the Year of the Snake. I was born in the Year of the Snake. Can I say—and apologies in advance to Hansard—xin nian kuai le, gong xi fa cai.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, I thank all of the organisers of the many events, including Michael Zhou of the Zhejiang United Association. We gathered at Riverstone Estate in the Yarra Valley and were joined by a lovely crowd, including the founding president, Jing Chen. I also thank the FCA, who organised an event in Springvale. Derrick Chen is the head of the FCA and also a constituent of mine in my electorate. I also want to thank his vice-president, Chunjiang Wu. This was an event that took a lot of work. I want to thank everyone who put it together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The signature event in Melbourne which attracts the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and, I think, just about every MP in Melbourne and beyond is the ABAW lunar new year event in Box Hill. I thank ABAW's president, Bihong Wang, its vice-president, Richard Shi, Tim Chen and their committee for their hard work and dedication. You are professionals in every sense of the word and that was a superb event. It was attended by over 100,000 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier in the day, I attended the light offering and world peace blessing ceremony in Box Hill. I want to thank Linda Chea, the president of this association. It was organised by Fo Guang Shan Melbourne and the Buddha's Light International Association of Victoria. It was also attended by the venerable Jue Min, superintendent of Fo Guang Shan Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the lunar new year committee from the CYSM, the Chinese Youth Society of Melbourne, who, with the HGYS and the BCA, the Bendigo association, gathered for a lunar new year parade and dragon dance in Melbourne. Thank you to Bill Lau, Carmen Lau and all of the organisers who put that event on. It was my honour to be there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in the day, we attended Melbourne's premier event for lunar new year, which had the Lord Mayor in attendance and many distinguished guests. Can I single out Christina Zhao, president of the MCBA, and also those who organised it, including Philip Liu, who is a councillor of Chinese heritage. There are many of Chinese heritage on the council, but he put a particular effort into organising that. That was also attended by over 100,000 people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Michelle Chen, David He and Derrick Chen again, who are from the Source and the FCA and had a spring gala event in the Besen Centre. I thank Tony Zalewski, who organised a community lunar new year event at the Stables Provedore Cafe. It was attended by over 150 people. I thank Selina Leung of the Manningham senior club Chinese celebration, which is the largest club in my electorate. At their event there were 38 tables, with over 10 people on each table. I was proud to sponsor that event. I thank Jordon Chen of the Shandong Association, who organised an event in the Box Hill Town Hall, noting that my principal adviser in my electorate office who teaches me Chinese is from Shandong as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Fusion Arts Spring Festival organisers, particularly Mrs Xia and Mrs Fang, for their event. I also thank the Box Hill Hawks for their lunar new year dinner. Ed Sill is the president, but the brains behind that is Diana Lin and the committee. Thank you for putting that together. It is a meld of two cultures: AFL and lunar new year. Then, finally, whilst not in my electorate, I spoke with Katie Allen, who is our Liberal candidate in Chisholm, and she wanted me to put her thanks on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record for the Glen Waverley event which was organised by Cecilia Hsieh and Hong De Lion and the Dragon Dance Association. Finally, it is worth noting that this is the first ever lunar new year event marked on the UNESCO heritage list. Xie xie.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the highlights of my year is always the citizenship ceremonies held over the Australia Day weekend. I always find it inspiring to meet our newest citizens and to hear their incredible stories. I was also thrilled to hear that one of Footscray's own became a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2025 Australia Day honours. Kleoniki Matziaris-Garay arrived in Australia from Greece at the age of 18 and has spent her life since then in the service of other migrants from Greece through the Australian Greek Welfare Society, Pronia. Pronia was established to help newly arrived Greek migrants to overcome language barriers and navigate government agencies and services. Kleoniki is a worthy recipient of Australia Day honours for her long service and embodies the spirit of service that makes our community thrive.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities right across my electorate have welcomed the Year of the Wood Snake with events that reflect all the colour and movement of Melbourne's west. Chuc mung nam moi At Ty. It has been a packed calendar, kicking off in Footscray on 12 January with an amazing event that successfully resisted the elements. On 19 January, the St Albans Business Group Association transformed Alfrieda Street in the heart of St Albans, hosting tens of thousands of revellers from breakfast to bedtime. Every year I think it can't get much bigger, and every year I'm happily proven wrong. In the spirit of healthy, celebratory competition, the Sunshine Business Association mounted a Tet festival on 26 January that saw the Hampshire Road shopping street filled with red pockets, red dragons, golden lions and painted faces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forty-eight hours later, I had to rustle up an appetite. I was in Braybrook for the Quang Minh Tet Festival. The Quang Minh temple is the spiritual heart of Victoria's Buddhist community, and lunar new year at the temple is an extraordinary experience. I encourage everyone in Melbourne to seek it out for next year's lunar celebration. It won't be an early night, but it will be an unforgettable one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend, the Vietnamese Community in Australia Victoria Chapter will bring to a close almost a month of lunar new year celebrations. On 15 and 16 February, a massive celebration will occur at Footscray Park. Tet is a time for Vietnamese families to come together to honour their ancestors and to look forward to a promise of a fresh start. 2025 is particularly significant for the Vietnamese community, who make up a third of Fraser's constituents. It marks 50 years since the arrival of the first Vietnamese refugees. The initial group was small in both number and size. They were orphaned children evacuated from Vietnam as a part of Operation Babylift. They were followed a year later by the first adult refugees, who had sailed more than 3,500 kilometres, seeking the fresh start that is celebrated at Tet. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's decision to open the doors to more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees came at a time that Fraser himself described as one in which 'the major political parties did not play politics with race or religion, with the lives of people fleeing from terror'. It was an honourable and courageous decision that changed the refuge and the refugee equally. The 100,000 refugees that made their home in Australia have run businesses and raised families. They have excelled in the professions, in community services, in the arts and in so much more. They have birthed their children on and buried their dead in Australian soil. Their stories have become Australian stories, and they are as many and varied as the people who carry them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to share one with you now. About a month ago I visited a constituent to wish her a happy birthday. Mrs Thi So Nguyen turned 105 this year and welcomed me to her family home in Cairnlea. Mrs Nguyen is a mother of eight and arrived in Australia at the age of 75 to be reunited with two of her daughters. It had been years since Mrs Nguyen had farewelled her daughters as they made the perilous journey to Australia. The eight children that she raised alone in difficulty, after the war in Vietnam and after her husband had been executed in front of her eyes, had scattered across the globe following the war.

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">SHARKIE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  Households and businesses are experiencing some of the most difficult economic times in living memory. Many of us in this place have talked about the cost of energy, groceries or fuel or about the economic hardship emanating from these rises. However, there hasn't been much discussion about the cost of insurance. While I've tabled a motion on this matter, I wish to again raise this important issue before the chamber. Across the nation, insurance premiums are rising well above the inflation rate and, in many instances, by more than 100 per cent. This is unsustainable, leaving many households and businesses opting to either not insure their assets or reduce the value of their cover. In doing so, they put themselves in serious financial risk. In the case of businesses, many are simply choosing to close, as they can neither afford the hike in insurance costs nor take the risk of operating without the correct level of cover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of even greater concern is that many postcodes have been deemed uninsurable by insurance companies with little or no evidence of increased risk. This is especially true in regional and rural Australia, where insurance companies have argued that the flood and fire risk is high, despite having insured properties in these areas for decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are experiencing is a complete market failure, and when market failures occur there is a legitimate role for government to intervene. The government must consider the broader implications of insurance premium increases for household budgets and businesses. I call on the government to go beyond consideration and establish an inquiry into the insurance sector to determine if fair pricing mechanisms are setting premiums. If insurance companies are denying cover or pricing people out of the market due to the purported increases in fires and floods, surely they must be made accountable for those decisions. Policy risk must be evidence based, and insurers should be required to demonstrate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, as I mentioned, what we are experiencing is market failure. If insurance companies are going to deny insurance coverage, the government must consider options. Accordingly, I call on the government to consider underwriting premiums as a last resort for postcodes that are deemed uninsurable or experiencing insurance premium increases greater than 50 per cent, because no Australian household or business should be at risk of losing everything they own. We must act decisively and with urgency.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  On Friday, I was so pleased to officially open Western Australia's eighth Medicare urgent care clinic in downtown Gosnells. It is Western Australia's largest urgent care clinic. Now our community will have access to free urgent medical care close to home, seven days a week, with extended hours. The Gosnells Medicare Urgent Care Clinic is equipped to treat a range of urgent but not life-threatening conditions and injuries—things like cuts, rashes, sprains and broken arms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2023-24, more than 40 per cent of the presentations to the emergency department at the Armadale-Kelmscott hospital were for semi-urgent and non-urgent conditions—conditions that are much better suited to an urgent care clinic. That often means people are waiting to be seen in the emergency department for too long. I'm conscious that a lot of people go to hospital with these sorts of conditions because they are not able to afford to book in to see a GP privately or because they need to wait days to be able to secure such an appointment. That is what's so exciting about this urgent care clinic; you can walk straight in and get the help you need quickly, and it's completely bulk-billed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new Gosnells Medicare Urgent Care Clinic will take a heap of pressure off the Armadale-Kelmscott hospital. With extended hours, it won't matter if it's after hours or on the weekend; locals can get the care they need close to home. Here in Australia, it's your Medicare card, not your credit card, that should determine the health care that you receive. I was joined at the opening event by Trish Cook, Labor's candidate for the federal seat of Bullwinkel, as well Colleen Egan, Labor's candidate for the state seat of Thornlie in the state election in Western Australia, because this urgent care clinic won't just be a big help for the community of Burt; it'll also service the whole south-east corridor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been proud to work with my local colleagues in the WA state government to deliver what's needed for our community. Whether that's delivering school funding alongside Tony Buti in Armadale, the Tonkin Highway extension with Hugh Jones in Darling Range, upgrades to community facilities in Southern River in the state electorate of Jandakot alongside Terry Healy and Yaz Mubarakai or cleaning up our waterways with Chris Tallentire in Thornlie, we've been able to achieve so much because we work together. I want to give a massive shout-out to Chris Tallentire, who'll be retiring at this state election. He's worked tirelessly for the Thornlie and Gosnells communities for almost 17 years. Chris, you have done so much to be proud of, and I can't wait to see what you do next. I also know that Labor's candidate for Thornlie, Colleen Egan, will continue your legacy. It's the partnership between the WA Labor government and the Albanese government that's seen so many positive outcomes for our community. As we look to the future, there's still much that we can achieve together.</span>

Karen started at Jumbunna as an assistant in 1989, and, while working full time, she studied for her degree and Master of Education. Jumbunna is an inspirational and much-loved organisation in my community. It is much more than just a preschool; it has an NDIS program, a playgroup and parental education programs. It provides early intervention for around 130 children each year, including children with disabilities and delays in development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Karen was instrumental in securing funding for the new Jumbunna hub. This is an extension of the preschool that offers early childhood support, support into adulthood, health alliance and psychology and counselling. I ran into Karen just two weeks ago, and she told me how much she loved her job, especially how moving it is to run into former students who are now grown adults and contributing to our community. Karen, thank you for everything you've done for our community and for the many children and the many families that you have made an impact on. I know you've left a lasting impact and influence on these children and their families. Thank you very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend is an exciting weekend in Lismore. There's going to be a Legends of Cricket Twenty20 match at Oakes Oval. I encourage everyone to get along. Lismore mayor Steve Krieg will captain the Mayor's XI and is going to take on Lismore's own Adam Gilchrist's XI. It's the second time the match has been held. It's planned around this time of the year because we're coming up to the three-year anniversary of the natural disaster that we had, and it's nice to have feel-good events around this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fans can look forward to seeing cricketing stars Steve O'Keefe, Michael Kasprowicz, Jason Gillespie, Dan Christian, Nathan Hauritz, Andy Bichel, Sammy-Jo Johnson, Claire Moore, Ebony Hoskin and Georgia Redmayne in action. Powderfinger's Bernard Fanning and Grinspoon's guitarist Pat Davern will also be putting on their whites. Excitingly, local young cricketers Cooper Williams and Joe Parsons will also be playing alongside these legends. Cooper's just 14 years old and is already playing first-grade cricket locally, hitting his first century just on the weekend. Joe Parsons is also making strides for Marist Brothers. Just last year, he had a remarkable innings, making 105 not out off 115 balls, which included 11 fours and two sixes. Thank you to all the players who are coming along to showcase their skills at Oakes Oval. It is sure to be a great event, and, as I say, it's especially important that this is happening as we come up to the three-year anniversary. I encourage everyone to get along to Oakes Oval this weekend.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  The Free TAFE Bill 2024 was passed by the House last week and sits now with the Senate. Hasluck—and, indeed, Western Australia—looks forward to the passage of the bill. The legislation lists seven national priority areas, and I've hopefully got time to mention three.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill includes a focus on the caring professions: aged care, child care, health care, disability care. We know there are shortages. We know there's a growing demand in these areas. We all know it. The Liberals and the Nationals know it, but knowing it and purporting to care about the caring professions and then failing to act is inexplicable. The Liberals and Nationals want to say they care about aged care, child care, health care and disability care, yet they allowed training in these sectors to run down for over a decade. They now oppose free training, and they refuse to tell us about their secret cuts to these sectors. If the coalition won't support our care workers then why should our care workers support the coalition?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area is housing construction. In the debate on the Free TAFE Bill, the member for Petrie said, 'We don't have enough tradies.' He's right. After a decade of neglect on the part of the Liberals and Nationals, it is no wonder we don't have enough tradies. This is the coalition that didn't even have a federal housing minister for most of its tenure. Not only has the Albanese government made the greatest investments in housing of any federal government since the Second World War, but the Liberals and Nationals have opposed those housing investments. We have reached out to support apprentices with a $10,000 incentive to assist them in completing their training. The coalition opposes free training for the very people who will build the houses we need. So, if the coalition won't support the tradies, why should the tradies support the coalition?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third area is our sovereign capability in manufacturing and defence. Henderson in Western Australia is now home to continuous naval shipbuilding. In concert with this excellent decision, the Albanese and Cook Labor governments are establishing Western Australia's Defence TAFE Centre of Excellence across four south metropolitan TAFE campuses in Perth. As well as helping WA workers to upskill and secure high-tech, well-paid jobs, this centre will create a pipeline of skilled workers in defence industries to keep Australia safe. There will be free TAFE courses at the centre as a matter of priority because the Albanese government prioritises manufacturing. The coalition voted against this support in the House and looks set to vote against it in the Senate. If the coalition won't support our manufacturing workers and won't support a future made in Australia, why should our manufacturing workers support the coalition?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  It's a great honour to represent the people of Petrie here in federal parliament. There are some 130,000 voters, and, when you add children in as well, there are a lot of people in Moreton Bay and Brisbane city that I represent. What we've seen under the Albanese Labor government is an increase in the cost of living, and it really hurts me to see that people are struggling in my electorate and around the country as well. Things have gotten considerably worse in the last three years since the Albanese government came to power and the government changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen, and how it's become more difficult for people of Petrie, is an increase in costs. Health is up 10 per cent, education's up 11 per cent, food is up 12 per cent, housing's up 14 per cent, rents are up 17 per cent—and acute homelessness is through the roof—insurance and financial services are up 18 per cent, gas is up 34 per cent and electricity is up 32 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at health, Labor talk a big game. I've said before that they continually say, 'Let's save Medicare.' The issue is that it's a complete joke. Under them, bulk-billing is lower. It's actually fallen by 11 percentage points in less than three years. The bulk-billing rate under the coalition government was 88 per cent; it's now down to 77 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to education, education is also up 11 per cent despite the rhetoric that we get from those opposite about free TAFE. Free TAFE is not free; it's costing taxpayers an additional $1½ billion on top of what we already spend on VET funding. The issue is that Labor only support the sector where their union donors are. That's why they want to do free TAFE, because you've got more unionists in TAFE, as far as it's been in state education. The problem is that it's not getting the results that we need. Under our system, we were ensuring that we were boosting apprenticeship schemes and actually paying for 50 per cent of wages, but Labor don't want to support employers; they only want to support union membership. When you govern that way, you get bad results, and that's partly why we've got a housing crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Food is up 12 per cent. Labor did not extend the 22 per cent discount that the coalition had in place on fuel, so, because of transport costs, we're seeing milk up 17 per cent, bread up 17 per cent and eggs up 17 per cent. And, when it comes to housing, there have been 12 interest rate rises under Anthony Albanese, and that's added $30,000 to mortgages, or $600 a week. Rents are also up 17 per cent, and that's why we're seeing acute homelessness growing under the Albanese government. Between the 2016 and 2021 censuses, the coalition reduced acute homelessness, reduced rough sleeping, reduced couch surfing and reduced severe overcrowding. Insurance is up after Labor's attacks on accountants and financial advisers. And electricity, the $275 promise, is out the door. In fact, it's gone up 30 per cent, and 100 per cent for businesses. We need to vote out Albanese.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  From the moment we came to government, we made it clear that we would prioritise tertiary education and support students, reversing nearly a decade of ideological attacks from the Liberals and Nationals. Our Australian Universities Accord set out a comprehensive blueprint for reform, focusing on accessibility, equity and long-term sustainability in higher education. Unlike the previous government, who ignored these challenges, we acted immediately on the accord's recommendations, addressing HECS debt relief, strengthening student protections and investing in a future-ready education system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start with student debt. We've already wiped $3 billion off student debt by fixing the unfair indexation of HECS. At times of high inflation, it is not fair to index student debts at rates higher than wages growth. We saw that problem, we did the work we needed to and we backdated the change. Refunds have flowed to those who were hit by this inequity. But it doesn't end there. If we're re-elected, we'll wipe 20 per cent off every student's debt to make tertiary education even fairer and more accessible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around the time that I went to university, my fees made up about 30 per cent of the cost of a degree, so my debt was lower. Under nearly a decade of the Liberals, that percentage went up to around 40 per cent. Thousands of Aussies were paying more than their predecessors. Wiping off this 20 per cent is about equity, accessibility and cost-of-living relief. In Bennelong, 23,692 locals will benefit from these changes, with an average of $5,700 wiped from their HECS debt. In Bennelong, we're so fortunate to have access to Macquarie University and three TAFE campuses—at Meadowbank, Ryde and soon St Leonards. Students from all these incredible institutions will benefit from the most significant reforms to student debt in our history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not just fixing the cost of education; we're making universities safer too. For years students have been calling for action on sexual violence and harassment on campus. Reports like <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">red zone report</span> have exposed the toxic culture of hazing and abuse in university colleges. Brave student advocates have been demanding accountability for over a decade. In response, we've established the National Student Ombudsman, an independent body with the power to investigate and resolve student complaints, including those related to sexual violence. For the first time, universities will be held accountable for their response, or lack of one, to safety concerns. We're also introducing a national higher education code to prevent and respond to gender based violence, setting clear national standards for how universities must address sexual harassment and assault.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll unashamedly back those who seek a tertiary education. We'll back people if they go to TAFE, we'll back people if they go to uni, and along the way we'll make it fairer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, I'd like to hazard a guess and say that you understand completely the power of mother nature. Our thoughts and our support need to go to our brothers and sisters, our fellow Australians, in northern Queensland as they go through those terrible floods up there. I'd like to also recognise the great work my good friend the member for Herbert is doing with his great community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fact remains that, in my electorate down on the west coast of Tasmania, the electorate of Braddon, a different disaster is occurring. At the moment, approximately 16,000 hectares of my electorate are on fire. North of the Pieman River on the rugged west coast, our rainforests and our button grass plains are immersed in fires—many fires—to the point that they are almost now into forestry area, up onto the north-west coast, and posing significant risk to the coupes that are maintained by Sustainable Timber Tasmania and Tasmanian forestry. I'd like to recognise sincerely the great work of our firefighters—our Tasmania Fire Service, those volunteer rural fire brigade services and those tenders who get out there every day and who understand intimately their background, their back door and how to best fight that fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ironically, in an area that is so heavily wooded, it is our forestry operators that are saving the day with heavy earthmoving machinery. I would like to send a big shout-out to earthmovers Collins Contracting at Smithton, who have got several bulldozers putting firebreaks in. The logging contractors have got fellers felling trees, and I saw footage last night of a feller felling a large tree that was on fire. That posed a significant life-threatening risk to the person doing that job on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Often in this place, as we sit on our shiny seats, we forget that that very real risk takes place on the ground. I think it would do us all good if we thought about those real people doing that real, dangerous job, protecting their real communities from life-or-death risk. So, to all of those involved, I want to say a big heartfelt thank you. Of course, this comes just past the anniversary, on 7 February 1967, of Tasmania's worst fire disaster, Black Tuesday, in which 62 Tasmanians lost their lives, 900 were injured and 7,000 were left homeless. Mother Nature is indeed a powerful thing. We need to respect it and we need to fight it. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury and Assistant Minister for Employment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  When Labor took office, veterans seeking support faced a backlog of 42,000 claims, with some waiting over two years to have their case looked at. This was the direct result of a decade of Public Service cuts and outsourcing. Labor set out to fix it. Ninety-seven per cent of the veteran claim backlog has been cleared. Veterans' claims that once took over 100 days are now allocated within two weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the coalition wants to backtrack. The coalition plan to cut 36,000 Public Service jobs, reducing the workforce by 20 per cent. This isn't speculation. The Nationals leader has said outright:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The first thing we'll do is sack those 36,000 public servants …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer has dismissed investment in the Public Service as 'unnecessary spending'. But what they call 'unnecessary spending' is essential services. Public servants process 121 million Centrelink and Medicare claims each year, manage aged care and the NDIS, handle border security and protect our nation from cyberthreats. Under the coalition, the Public Service was deliberately hollowed out. A staffing cap forced departments to rely on 54,000 private contractors. Between 2013 and 2022, departmental spending increased 35 per cent, yet Public Service staffing fell by four per cent. The result? Longer waiting times, declining service standards and outsourcing of essential government functions to overpriced consultants. At Services Australia, underfunding led to robodebt, unresolved claims and a blowout in processing times. Pressures on our biosecurity system put Australia at risk of pest outbreaks. In Home Affairs, staffing cuts weakened Australia's ability to combat organised crime and human trafficking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor made a different choice. We lifted the staffing cap, reduced reliance on consultants and prioritised permanent skilled Public Service jobs. The result? Times for paid parental leave approvals, done in 31 days under the former government, went down to three days under us. Youth allowance applications that once took 28 days now take 10. At Services Australia alone, 3,000 additional frontline staff cleared half a million claims in just 10 weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's plan would undo this progress. The reality is simple: cutting 36,000 jobs won't make government services disappear; it'll just push the work back onto private consultants at a higher cost to taxpayers and with less transparency. The cuts wouldn't just hit Canberra; almost 63 per cent of the Public Service workforce is based outside the capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The election is a choice: do we invest in a Public Service that is fit for purpose or let right-wing ideologues weaken the institutions that hold the country together? If you want a government that works, don't backtrack with Dutton.</span>

Most recently, John Veage was awarded the 2025 Citizen of the Year. If you've seen a photo of someone in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Leader </span>or you've seen a photo of someone surfing at the Alley, there's a pretty good chance John took the photo. John, or Veagey as he is known around the shire, was a founding member of the Cronulla Boardriders Club and president of Surfing Sutherland Shire. He was the official photographer for 39 years at our local newspaper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Leader</span>. Next up, Veagey is looking at having a surfing museum in Cronulla so Loretta can help him get rid of the 100-plus boards they're storing around their house. I'm going to support him to get it done.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge the Order of Australia recipients in my local community. Michael Byrne was appointed as an Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to the transport industry and his community. Michael was a former CEO of Linfox and advised the government on logistics and supply chain issues during the COVID pandemic. Michael's also volunteered for Elouera Surf Club, has played soccer for 48 years and has played cricket for 38 years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Medicare and bulk-billed urgent care clinics are so important for many in my community after suffering a decade of cuts from Peter Dutton and the previous Liberal government. For too long, families, pensioners and vulnerable Australians in my electorate of Wills have struggled with rising healthcare costs and a decline in bulk-billing, the direct result of a decade of coalition neglect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government froze Medicare rebates and ripped billions out of primary care, causing gap fees to plummet. For years under the coalition government, my community told me how expensive it was for them to see their GP and how fewer and fewer GPs were offering bulk-billed services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been strongly advocating for an increase in bulk-billed appointments and free Medicare urgent care clinics to ensure that people in my community of Wills have access to quality, bulk-billed health care when they need it. Free Medicare urgent care clinics allow families to access bulk-billed health care without waiting hours in an emergency department. We have one near our community, in Carlton, which serves many in the south of my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Albanese Labor government, remarkably, 87 clinics have opened across the country, treating over a million Australians for urgent but non-life-threatening conditions—burns, cuts, broken bones. Every visit is fully bulk-billed. You don't need your credit card; you just need your Medicare card. For my constituents, this will mean faster access to care and less pressure on hospital emergency departments. It means parents with sick kids won't be spending hours in a waiting room. It means older Australians won't be skipping the doctor because they can't afford the gap fee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has also made the largest investment in bulk-billing in Medicare's history. It has tripled the bulk-billing incentives so that those who rely on their GP most—pensioners, kids and concession card holders—can see a doctor without worrying about out-of-pocket costs. But, while Labor is strengthening Medicare and building free Medicare urgent care clinics, we've got Peter Dutton as Leader of the Opposition, who's spent a career trying to tear Medicare down. As health minister, he tried to introduce a GP tax, forcing people to pay every time they saw a doctor. He cut $50 billion from public hospitals. He was voted the worst health minister in Medicare's history by Australian doctors. He tried to destroy Medicare before; we will not let him do it again. Labor built Medicare, and only a Labor government will protect and strengthen it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is now a full-blown crisis. To have the most dangerous roads and commensurate statistics since 1966 tells you that last year was the most deadly year on our roads since 1966. The Australian road toll continues to track in the wrong direction. As you've just heard, the annual fatality rate per 100,000 head of population is 4.8. Our national bipartisan target—a national target we've all subscribed to—is 2.0. At the end of 2024, Australia's 12-month road toll was 18.5 per cent higher than when the strategy began in 2021. That's higher than when we as a nation committed to putting this statistic on a downward trajectory, close to 20 per cent higher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The continual rise in road fatalities reiterates the need for national leadership on road safety and the crisis facing the nation. But, sadly, Labor is failing Australians on efficiency, on productivity and, most tragically, on the safety of our roads. We need better insight into the safety issues on our roads to ensure that road safety initiatives and infrastructure funding are being directed where needed and to address the road safety crisis, not the political crisis unfolding with those opposite. The Albanese government cut, cancelled or delayed more than $27.9 billion—it bears repeating: $27.9 billion—in infrastructure funding in its first 2½ years of government. Of course, we don't need to go over the 90-day review process, which felt like 90 months, but, in any event, it caused significant delays and resulted in life-saving projects being cut, cancelled or delayed. The result of the review cancelled important infrastructure projects and diverted funding from those projects to Labor's pet projects in marginal seats.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll leave others in this chamber to talk about their experience in their jurisdictions, but let me take you to South Australia. South Australia has a road network of 23,000 kilometres, but Labor only seems concerned about those roads that fall within the very tight boundary of the electorate of Boothby, which is 115 square kilometres. The federal and state Labor governments recently announced a $30 million infrastructure investment in Brighton Road. The investment follows $200 million to remove the tram level crossing at Morphett Road. Unfortunately for South Australian road users, federal and state Labor government infrastructure investment decisions seem to be based not on the science or the data around road safety but rather on the political needs of Louise Miller-Frost. When there exists a $3 billion road maintenance backlog in South Australia—not to mention the funding needed for pivotal future-proofing infrastructure projects, such as the Greater Adelaide Freight Bypass and the duplication of major freight routes, such as the Augusta, Sturt and Dukes Highways—we need leadership that thinks beyond saving the political skin of the current member for Boothby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian Minister for Infrastructure and Transport refuses to release the outcomes of the Australian road safety program, AusRAP, the five-star rating system, through the FOI process, despite state and territory governments agreeing in 2024 to end years of secrecy by publishing a range of data, including AusRAP data, on the federal government's National Road Safety Data Hub. The program uses assessment tools used in around 130 countries to target investment and reduce death and injury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It beggars belief that, at a time when this country is experiencing the worst road safety statistics since 1966, we've got an Albanese-led Labor government more focused on holding onto key seats—and indeed his keys to the Lodge—than investing in infrastructure projects that will save lives. The government infrastructure investment decision is short sighted and based on politics rather than evidence; Australia's productivity has been put on hold and community safety compromised as a result. In contrast, the former coalition government set us on the trajectory of increased investment in road infrastructure. We were building what was needed for the safe and productive movement of goods and to ensure people got home to their loved ones safely. We need to take the politics out of road investment decisions and focus instead on evidence and transparency. It's time to get Australia's roads back on track.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I thank the member for Barker for raising this motion on the very important subject of road safety and the horrendous road toll we have currently. Every year, hundreds of Australians lose their lives or are seriously injured in road crashes, and the devastating road toll calls for action on both sides of this place. It is something that we must all do together, across jurisdictions and across levels of government. Surely that's something we all can agree on—that we must lower our road toll. We must aim for zero deaths on our roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't need to tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, given you're from the Territory as well, where we had a really bad year on our roads last year, that it's devastating to see the mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, and children and grandchildren that have been killed on our roads or have otherwise been left with a big gaping hole in their families through road trauma and road deaths—those who leave home with no expectation that they won't make it to their destination. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It truly is not just in the Territory; it is a national tragedy. As the Prime Minister's Special Envoy for Defence, Veterans' Affairs and Northern Australia, our roads in the north are a key focus of mine. They provide the vital links across the north but also between the north and our southern hubs, providing a key supply chain for economic prosperity and for the defence of our nation. But, in all of this—the importance of our industry and the importance of our Defence—we must do everything we can to make sure that all road users are safe. I know it's something the ADF takes seriously and that industry continues to look at. We implore visitors, when they're touring to the north, to slow down and not be in a rush. Don't think that you've got to overtake on every overtaking lane, because we see that impatience on our roads causes crashes, injury and death. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, 58 Territorians lost their lives on Territory roads. That is nearly double the 31 lives lost the year prior, 2023. As the Australian Automobile Association reported, this 87.1 per cent increase in only one year made 2024 the deadliest calendar year on Territory roads since 2008. Already, four Territorians have lost their lives in 2025, and we're only in early February.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These lives are not just a statistic, of course. As I said, Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, and as you know well, they're someone's loved ones. Just this year, there are four loved ones who won't come home, which is why it is absolutely essential that the Australian government does its utmost to reduce the road toll. We are implementing the National Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030. This is underpinned by the National Road Safety Action Plan 2023-2025, in collaboration with all states and territories and all local governments, because road safety is a shared responsibility across all levels of government. We are doubling the Roads to Recovery funding from $500 million to $1 billion a year. We're on that path. I know, because I'm the chair of the black-spots NT committee, that we've substantially increased funding for the Black Spot Program, which is rising from $110 million to $150 million per year, and I think we can do more. As a government we know there is more to be done, and that's why our Labor government is continuing to work with the states to get the road toll to zero. We understand the importance of investing in our infrastructure and for making our roads safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to end with a message to all road users. Please think about how your actions today are impacting tomorrow's drivers. Your behaviour behind the wheel and on our roads is influencing that next generation of drivers every day. It's up to all of us to teach our kids how to be safe on the roads.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  It's a great honour to be able to second this motion by the member for Barker. I thank him for the cooperation in working to put this motion to this place, because he knows and understands, as a neighbour of mine, how important road funding is to regional and rural Australia—in particular, to his electorate, the electorate of Barker, and to my electorate, the electorate of Wannon. This data sadly speaks for itself, with 1,300 lives lost on Australian roads in 2024. Think of the impact that that has had on those families, the friends of those people and local communities right across Australia. This is something that we have to address. The last four years have seen the road toll go up each and every year. We haven't seen that since before the introduction of seat belts. We really need to see action from the government now. We need to see it from the Victorian state Labor government as well. We cannot see more lives continue to be lost on our roads, rather than less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we need to do to make sure that we turn this around? To start with, we need state governments—and we need the Victorian state government—to release the Australian Road Assessment Program data, which sets out what the rating is, from one to five, for every road across every state and territory. I was able to get this information, dating back to 2014, through a freedom of information request. That's what it took to get this information for Victorian roads. Why won't the state Labor government just release that data? If it did, we would know where we need to immediately fund our regional and rural roads in particular. If we know what the star rating is, we know where we need to put the funds towards. I call on the Victorian state government and the Albanese Labor government to require that that information be released every year so we know what is occurring with our road infrastructure and where we need to put urgent effort in to make sure that our roads are safe for people to travel on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need the Albanese Labor government to immediately reverse its cuts to our roads—over $80 million worth of cuts to roads in Wannon. It's unconscionable. We need more funding, not less. And we also need the Victorian state Labor government to put maintenance funding back into our roads. Don't cut road maintenance funding at this time. Put more maintenance funding back into our roads. How could they do it? They could act immediately if they wanted to. They've got their priorities wrong. We've seen all of this money go into the Suburban Rail Loop. The Albanese Labor government has set aside $2.2 billion to go into the<span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;&#xA;    font-family:Arial;&#xA;  font-weight:bold;&#xA;    color:#767676;&#xA;  text-decoration:none line-through;"></span>Suburban Rail Loop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> today that the Victorian state Labor government, due to the walloping they've had in the polls, are thinking about changing their priorities. Well, stop thinking about it and just do it. Look at fixing your existing infrastructure—in particular, your existing road infrastructure, which is declining day by day because you're not putting the investment into it that is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to drive our roads to see the urgent attention that is needed. I say this to Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister, and I say this to the Premier of Victoria: just hop in your car and do what I do on a daily basis and drive around my electorate. You'd see straightaway that there is a need for more investment, not for cutting investment. Not only that; you need to ensure your maintenance program holds up. In Victoria, we used to maintain our roads by repairing and resurfacing them every 13 years. Under this Victorian state Labor government and the cuts to funding by the federal Labor government, we'll be lucky to do that over the next 60 years. Let's get attention to our road network now. That's why I'm proud to second this motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELYEA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I'm pleased to join my colleagues the member for Solomon and the member for Macarthur in speaking on this motion moved by the member for Barker. Every day, Australians set out on their daily commutes to work, on school runs and on long-haul drives, trusting that they will reach their destination safely, while many people set off on holidays across the country, travelling in caravans and motorhomes. This past 12 months, we have lost 1,300 lives. This is the highest road toll since 2012. The road toll has risen each year for the past four years. This increase has not been seen since 1966 or before the introduction of compulsory seatbelts. The road safety crisis is now killing more than a hundred Australians every month and hospitalising a hundred Australians every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the mother of an 18-year-old young man who just got his licence, along with many of his friends, this is of deep concern. We know young men, in particular, take risks when driving. Ensuring they keep their speed down is critical. You will often hear me say, when I'm Flynn's passenger in the car, 'Slow down.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that impacts the road toll, which I hear about in my electorate of Dunkley when I'm out and about on the doors, is the state of the roads—the potholes that create damage to cars and tyres and that have people veering off in the wrong direction when they hit the holes or try to dodge them. Potholes make driving dangerous, particularly when excessive speed is involved at night and in the rain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Behind these numbers we hear about are devastated families, communities grieving and an economic toll that stretches into the billions. Every one of us has a role to play in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities on our roads. The safety of drivers on our roads is a priority for the Albanese government, and this government has done an immense amount of work to address this issue, more so than the opposition. On a very practical level, we have more than doubled the Roads to Recovery Program funding, from $500 million to $1 billion per year. This is funding that will go to local councils, like Frankston City Council, to deliver road safety projects across the country. In Dunkley alone, the federal government will spend more than $6.5 million to fix roads in the next five years. The $6.5 million given to Frankston City Council by the federal government includes a $2.8 million increase from the prior five years. On a national level, we have also increased funding under the Black Spot Program from $110 million to $150 million per year and created the new Safer Local Roads and Infrastructure Program. That will increase over time to $200 million per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also committed to improving data collection and using it to increase road safety, including ensuring there are improved data-sharing requirements for state and territories. This was something the Liberals and Nationals refused to do when they were in government. For the first time, it creates a requirement for the provision of a nationally consistent dataset on roads to help address the issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The road toll is an issue, particularly in big cities like Melbourne and in communities like Dunkley, with people driving far too fast on local roads. Lowering speed limits in high-risk areas, building more speed humps—a recommendation from Dunkley locals when I'm on the doors—and enforcing stricter penalties for speeding offenders will significantly reduce fatalities, because excessive speed is a major factor in fatal crashes and the road toll. Road crashes remain one of the leading causes of death and serious injury in our country, and my family knows that far too well. I urge everyone to watch their speed, particularly our newest P-platers on the road. The road toll is just far too high. Any death on Australian roads is one death too many.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I want to thank the member for Barker and the member for Wannon. We represent different parts of Australia. The members for Barker and Wannon represent rural and regional Australia for the most part, and I represent metropolitan Australia. I just want to acknowledge that this is an issue that covers every electorate, but it disproportionately affects rural and regional Australia because of the obvious fact that you have more trees on the side of the roads, cars going at speed directly opposite each other, and greater fatigue. That is why the road toll is, to our national shame, higher in rural and regional Australia. So I thank those members for their advocacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not just talking about numbers on a page. The member for Barker noted that the road toll per 100,000 is at 4.8. Every September, the MCG is full for the grand final, and at capacity it holds about 100,000 people. Imagine your one game of the year is that grand final, and the price you pay for that is that about five people in that stadium that day will not survive. That's the price you pay for attending that one game a year. All we are asking, and all both sides of politics have committed to, is to reduce that to two. We would move heaven and earth if five people died attending the grand final every year, but that sense of urgency isn't here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The criminal law is a blunt instrument, and very few road accidents are about deliberate, intentional criminal activity. They're mostly in the field of negligence or recklessness, mostly by young men. There are three tools at our disposal to reduce the road toll: technology, training and infrastructure. As to technology, I myself survived a car accident because of technology. When I was a baby, our car was hit head-on by a truck, and, but for advances in seatbelt technology, I wouldn't be here. In terms of training, we know that young men are more prone to taking risks. You see it on the road. When a car shoots past you, zooms into a lane or cuts off another car, more often than not it is a young man who thinks that he will live forever. I saw that in a yearlong trial that I conducted for road fatalities. We heard from world-leading experts that the only antidote to that is supervised experience with someone showing you the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the third part, infrastructure, is where the government can do the most work. We heard the fine speeches from those opposite about how every life matters and this issue is just a serious for them as it is for us, but let's judge them on their actions. In my seat of Menzies, there is a notorious intersection called Five Ways. It's called Five Ways because five roads intersect. The council have told us that, as a state road, all it needs is a roundabout, at the cost of $10 million. That's it—$10 million. Two years ago, just before I got elected, a young woman died at that intersection, and many others in the area know that they take their lives into their hands when they move through that notorious part of Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leading up to the election, the coalition had a commitment of $10 million. My Labor opponent said, in the local newspaper, they would match it. I thought: 'Great. Here is an example of bipartisanship, where we're agreeing that a problem is there, it can be solved and there's a plan.' But what happened? I went to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in her ministerial suite, and when I sat down, surrounded by all the department officials, they shuffled some papers and said, 'We're really sorry, but our candidate didn't fill in the form. You can do with that what you want.' So the first reaction was a process one. Whatever paperwork was supposed to be filled in by the Labor Party wasn't filled in, so I was told, and instead of the minister saying, 'But I will do it anyway; I will honour that commitment,' it was 'You can use it for political purposes.' Well, the minister can shove the political purposes, with respect. The correct response was to say: 'I will fix that road anyway because it is about lives. It is not about politics.' That is the problem with this government. It's always about the politics. It's not about lives. It's about the politics. I don't care about the politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll be making that commitment again, and I won't just call on my opponent to match it. I will say: 'Show me the paperwork, because we don't trust you. We don't trust this government's commitments, because you are putting Australians' lives at risk.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  As a young neurosurgical resident in the late 1970s, I went to Royal Ryde Rehabilitation Hospital on many occasions to visit patients who were in long-term rehabilitation for severe neurological injury following motor vehicle accidents and other accidents. It was terrible. I'd like to acknowledge that, whilst every day in Australia three people die on our roads, over a hundred are severely injured, many of them left with severe neurological problems. I'd like to pay my respects to Royal Rehab Private Ryde, which is still doing amazing work in the rehabilitation of people following major motor vehicle injuries and also other injuries, and I acknowledge the work they do. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge our first responders. I know the member for Barker, as a police officer, probably did see severe trauma on our roads and had to deal with that, as do our ambulance officers, police officers and, of course, our emergency doctors and nurses—seeing people brought in after severe motor vehicle accidents. What is a tragedy is that every one of those people killed affects their larger family, and those that are severely injured often have lifelong complications that affect not just them but their whole families. It is not only an enormous cost in terms of money but also an enormous emotional cost for all of those people that are injured on our roads, and their families.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, what is happening is that our road toll, both in terms of deaths and the severely injured, is increasing. This is in these days of improved technology, improved medical care, improved rapid responses, improved neurosurgery, improved orthopaedic surgery and quicker access to acute management. Yet our road toll is increasing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that we really don't know is why. I don't want to politicise this argument in any way. None of us in this place—none of us—want to see our road toll increasing. We want to bring it down, we want lives saved and we want to see fewer people with the severe consequences of motor vehicle accidents. It's not something that I want to politicise, but we do need better data. I'd like to acknowledge the work that Michael Bradley and the Australian Automobile Association are doing in trying to improve data collection in this space.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't really know why our road toll is increasing. Our cars are better, our technology is better and our health care is better, yet the toll is increasing. And that's creating a huge burden on our health services, on the NDIS and on the families involved with this. We have, of course, better access to better roads through our Roads to Recovery Program. The federal government has doubled the spending on the Roads to Recovery Program to a bit over a billion dollars per year. We've increased funding for the Black Spot Program. We've created safer local roads and community infrastructure. We're making our infrastructure better, yet our road toll is increasing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need better data collection. We need much better access to the technology involved in road safety. With the support of the Transport Workers Union, we've been able to get better, new technology for recognition of bike roads et cetera for our large vehicles by using the technology that's available. We need to get that in all our vehicles on the roads, and that will make a difference. But, above all, we need all our states and territories to get together to put together a much better data collection system so that we know what is causing our road toll and what is causing the deaths and the severe injuries. We need to make sure that lives are saved. This is not a political issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2022 federal election, the former Prime Minister said that his top priorities were jobs, jobs and jobs. But guess who actually delivered? That's right—the Albanese Labor government. This government has created over a million jobs, and that is a record. Last month's job numbers show that Labor governments have delivered the lowest average unemployment for any Australian government in 50 years. And this isn't an accident; it's not a black swan event. This has been by design. This is something that Western Australia cares deeply about, and this is something that matters to Swan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this actually mean in Swan? ABS data shows that there has been a six per cent job increase in the south-east region of Perth in December 2024, compared to December 2023. This region includes the entire Swan electorate and surrounds. This has resulted in almost 340,000 jobs for people in Swan that were employed during that period. Unemployment fell from 14,200 in December 2023 to 11,500 in December 2024. What a fantastic result! It highlights that our strong economic growth and jobs creation plan is working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policies are delivering real results. Initiatives such as fee-free TAFE are equipping people with job-ready skills. Infrastructure investments and wage growth are strengthening our economy and creating opportunities. But there is more work to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that Western Australia is the engine room of the Australian economy. WA has an abundance of minerals below the ground, but we also have amazing renewable energy resources above the ground. Our critical minerals are essential for solar panels, battery storage and wind turbines. As the mighty federal mining minister said, 'The world's pathway to net zero emissions runs through the Western Australian outback.' So it makes sense for us to explore the opportunities that are right under our feet. We have the opportunity to lay the foundations for our future, and we have a plan—the most significant initiative for Australia's resource sector in a generation, a plan to secure jobs and to secure our future. This includes a 10 per cent production tax incentive to boost critical minerals processing. As a former process engineer, I think this is pretty cool. That is a $17 billion investment over 14 years. The risk? Zero—no production, no tax credits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's motion recognises the role that tax credits will play in critical minerals processing, and yet once again the coalition says no. A plan for the future? No. The support for industry? No. Secure jobs for Australians? No. It is not surprising the Liberals voted against tax cuts, higher wages and cheaper medicines. Under the Liberals, inflation would have soared, real wages would have fallen and living standards would have declined. They have no plan; they have no vision. Under Labor, inflation is down nearly a third of what we inherited, real wages are rising and living standards are improving. The extra 1.1 million people in jobs are grateful that these jobs are existing. But we must take steps to secure jobs for the future, and we won't let the Liberals hold us back. Their slogan is 'Back'—back to six per cent inflation, back to higher unemployment, back to wages going backwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, the federal coalition are turning their backs on WA by not supporting this plan. They're turning their backs on Western Australians. Unlike the federal coalition, the WA Liberals and the Nationals understand the importance of the Albanese government policy. Libby Mettam, the leader of the WA Liberals has said, 'We will support this measure.' That's because they understand WA and they understand the resources sector. It has been supported by industry, too. Rebecca Thomson, CEO of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, said, 'This measure recognises the federal government's commitment to supporting industry.' Perhaps the federal coalition should listen to WA and not overrule the WA Liberals once again. Processing critical minerals will turbocharge our resources sector and create jobs all across WA.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  This time last year, I moved a private members' motion calling on the government to increase Australia's international competitiveness for new energy industries, specifically with production tax credits. I'd been worried that Australia was not acting fast enough nor decisively enough to take advantage of the global transition to green energy. Coming from WA, I wanted to make sure that we are harnessing every opportunity to transition swiftly and profitably. The government later announced the Future Made in Australia (Production Tax Credits and Other Measures) Bill 2024, which the Leader of the Opposition immediately attacked, calling the production tax credits 'billions for billionaires', displaying a sad lack of awareness about the opportunity for WA to continue to carry the country economically into a decarbonised world. This objection from the opposition was despite investors, climate finance experts and industry, including the Chamber of Minerals and Energy WA, supporting this bill. It was typical—opposition for the sake of opposition, rather than on its merits. Even the leader of the WA Liberal Party came out in support. This is because production tax credits, when designed correctly, make good sense for the economy. Here I am, 12 months later, rising once again to speak on production tax credits, and this time I call on the opposition to support the legislation that will mean we can actually get the production tax credit scheme off the ground. Can we please stop politicking and just get this done?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that a stable investment environment is essential if we want to attract investment that we need to unleash our next wave of future prosperity. Companies are actively looking to develop and grow their renewable operations in Australia, but they need tangible confirmation of Australia's energy transition vision. We need to give investors the confidence and certainty that Australia will welcome and incentivise the new energy opportunities currently knocking on the door.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Production tax credits is a proven economic tool that has been used prolifically under the US Inflation Reduction Act. While the future of the US IRA is no longer certain under a Trump presidency, the enthusiastic uptake of clean energy production tax credits under the IRA up until now does at least show us that investors are motivated by this credit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia and the Minerals Council of Australia have all given evidence to a parliamentary committee supporting this bill. Rebecca Tomkinson of CMEWA has talked about the need for this bill to level the playing field in an intensely competitive global market. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Passage of the legislation would set an important investment signal for further value adding activities and provide certainty to industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Production tax credits are a great way for government to derisk new investments. Instead of money paid upfront for something that may or may not turn into something tangible, production tax credits are payable only when a company delivers, so taxpayers are paying for results, not attempts. This helps with building a business case in a new industry, derisking the sort of forward-looking investment that we need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want WA to benefit from the global transition to green energy. If the government wants to be on the right side of history, it needs to be creating policy settings like this that derisk and crowd in private investment. We have so many resources that are essential for the transition. Critical minerals like lithium, nickel, cobalt, silicon and rare earth elements are essential components in many rapidly growing clean energy technologies. They're critical because they can't be easily or cost-effectively substituted. WA accounts for around half of global lithium production and is a major exporter of nickel, cobalt, manganese and rare earth elements. We have a skilled workforce and access to export routes. We should be leading on critical mineral production. The world wants this stuff, and WA can provide it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we're at risk of being left behind as other countries get the jump on us in transforming their economies. We have the opportunity to be well positioned for global trade in a decarbonised world, but if we're too complacent about it we will miss out. It's essential that we accelerate opportunities in WA's critical minerals sector and capitalise now on the position that critical and battery minerals will play in decarbonising the global economy. I urge members from across the House to have a bit of vision and support WA by getting behind production tax credits so we can make the most of the opportunities ahead and continue to carry the country economically.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I'm delighted to second the motion of my friend and colleague Zaneta Mascarenhas from the neighbouring electorate of Swan in the great state of Western Australia. In Hasluck, as in Swan, and right across Western Australia, the Albanese and Cook Labor governments are working with our vocational training institutions and universities, along with industry, to create the jobs for Western Australian workers. In WA, we have the lowest unemployment rate in the country, at 3.4 per cent. That's in a country where the Albanese government's policies have managed to keep unemployment low while getting inflation down from over six per cent to under three per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia is the engine room of Australia's economy. It is one of the most productive and diversified mineral and petroleum regions on the planet. With only 11 per cent of the Australian population, WA is the major driver of external trade, producing almost half of Australia's total merchandise exports in 2023-24. We're proud of it, and rightly so, because it doesn't come easy. It means hard, technically challenging work—often away from partners, children and family—in tough terrain and sweltering conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has visited Western Australia more than any leader in memory. Why? Because he understands the importance of Western Australia and that our federal policies must be shaped by what's happening on the ground in WA. Introducing and passing the Future Made in Australia (Production Tax Credits and Other Measures) Bill 2024 through the House in November was Labor's priority, because we understand the challenges and opportunities ahead for mining, manufacturing, innovation and exports in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, does the Liberal opposition leader understand WA? No, he doesn't. He voted against the bill in November. It's now February. Has the opposition wised up? The lack of Liberal speakers on this motion today is testimony to the fact that they are completely deaf to the needs of Western Australia. It's lovely to have the member for Riverina here, but New South Wales is not Western Australia, and it's certainly not Queensland either. How disappointing indeed. Just last week, Senator Reynolds indicated she would oppose the bill, and she said that we have 'quoted a couple of people in the mining sector who are supportive of this'. A couple of people? That's the understatement of the autumn sitting! If the senator or the member for Dickson think that they've got any friends in Western Australia on this matter, they might need to think again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The production tax credit is about building the future of WA and Australia, and it is supported by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia and the Minerals Council of Australia. These organisations have hundreds of members that they represent and speak for. AMEC's CEO, Warren Pearce, expects mining companies to establish valuable projects in Australia rather than overseas as a result of this legislation. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia—WA's peak resources sector representative body—knows critical minerals are vital to the future. Minerals like copper, cobalt, lithium, nickel and what are known as rare earth elements are needed in electricity networks, electric vehicles and wind turbines, and that's just the start. The CEO of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, Rebecca Tomkinson—who I'm very pleased the member for Curtin and the member for Swan referenced—expressed support for the Albanese Labor government's commitment to supporting industry and to level the playing field in what is an intensely competitive global market. She tells us:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Passage of the legislation would set an important investment signal for further value adding activities and provide certainty to industry.</span>

Regarding the US Inflation Reduction Act, Meg O'Neill, the CEO of Woodside, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It delivers tax credits once a project is up and running rather than up front subsidies—which is good for taxpayers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical minerals production tax credit is the same. The peak bodies are wholly on board with this legislation. The opposition find themselves very much out in the cold. We need to start listening to what Western Australians are saying. Liberals, you need to pass it; Nationals, get on board.</span>

                  </a>  I am sticking to the motion. The motion is very much about Western Australia. Here we go. Point (2)—and you seconded it—moves that this House 'commends the government for standing up for Western Australia and for recognising that Western Australia is the engine room of the economy'. Well, if sheep aren't part of Western Australia and aren't part of that engine room of the economy, then I don't know what is! It's your motion, Member for Hasluck, and I am speaking to that motion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you stopped the live sheep exports, not only did you hurt WA farmers; you hurt those Middle Eastern nations which relied on our live sheep. They relied on them for their traditional festivals and they relied on them for their customs, but what we told them was a big fat no. It was a diplomatic disaster. When the then agriculture minister, Senator Murray Watt—who I've got a little bit of time for—made the announcement that the live sheep trade was being banned, do you think he went and faced up to them? Do you think he went and eyeballed them? Do you think he went in front of them? No. He went to Perth and made the announcement, probably via Zoom. That was that; this was this. He got on the plane and came back to the eastern states. Shame on him! Part of politics is actually fronting up to those people who don't necessarily agree with you when you're making decisions on their livelihoods, and he did not. For those Western Australian sheep farmers, I praise them. I applaud them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you that the first order of business when we get back into government will be to restore this trade. This trade leads the world in animal welfare, leads the world in making sure that we take care of those animals on those ships. Yes, they had some improvement to do—no question. But to suggest that other nations which will now fill the void left by Australia if animal welfare is the first port of call for them—if you think that, you're vastly mistaken, because we had in place the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System. We had in place a system by which the sheep's pants were measured, their pen sizes were improved and the ventilation on the ships was improved. It was a good trade. Sheep, at the end of the day, are bred for meat. They're bred for meat.</span>

One of the great tragedies of the budget before last was when the member for Rankin went to that dispatch box and gave his speech. The biggest contribution and allocation to agriculture was to shut down the live sheep trade. The biggest allocation that the Labor government gave to agriculture was to shut a trade down—$107 million of compensation to stop doing what the farmers had done for years. That's the way Labor treats our farmers, thumbing their nose and telling the farmers that they are doing a good job. That's the Labor way.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  Today we celebrate a significant achievement. The Australian government has successfully created over one million jobs since May 2022. This milestone reflects the dedication of countless Australians contributing to our nation's recovery and growth. Under the Albanese Labor government, we have seen the largest increase in employment during a single parliamentary term in our history, with more than 652,000 of these being full-time positions. This accomplishment is particularly commendable given the global economic challenges, including pandemic effects, inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. The creation of these jobs demonstrates effective governance and a clear vision for a prosperous future. It signifies the commitment not only to recover from past setbacks but also to build a resilient economy capable of withstanding future challenges. These jobs created represent hope for families, stability for communities and opportunities for individuals to realise their dreams. This achievement is a collective effort and a collaboration between government, businesses and workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the Albanese Labor government for its unwavering support for Western Australia, recognising it is the engine room of our economy. Western Australia is not just a state. It drives economic growth through its vast resources. The state has consistently contributed significantly to national prosperity, accounting for over 20 per cent of economic growth in recent years, largely fuelled by critical minerals, energy resources and agricultural products. The Albanese Labor government's commitment to Western Australia is evident in policies prioritising job creation and economic stability. By investing in infrastructure, education and training programs tailored for Western Australians, we ensure that this state continues to thrive. Developing critical industries in Western Australia supports local economies and strengthens our nation's position in global markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One promising initiative is the introduction of production tax credits for critical minerals. These credits aim to encourage mineral processing in Western Australia and create secure jobs in the resources sector. The proposed critical minerals production tax incentive will provide a 10 per cent refundable tax offset, simulating investment and innovation in this vital area. Critical minerals are essential for modern technologies, from electric vehicles to renewable energy systems, and Australia is uniquely positioned to lead in the field. By fostering a robust critical mineral sector through these tax incentives, we ensure Australia remains a global competitor while ensuring jobs for future generations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This initiative will attract domestic and international investment, driving innovation and creating high skilled jobs that are crucial for our economy. Moreover, these production tax credits will support local communities by encouraging sustainable practices in mineral processing. As we transition towards a greener economy, it is imperative to harness our natural resources responsibly by investing in cleaner technologies within Western Australia, whose mining sector sets an example for other nations while safeguarding our environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we celebrate these achievements, we must recognise the importance of bipartisan support for these initiatives. I urge the opposition to reconsider their stance on production tax credits. Blocking such measures would hinder job creation and investment at a time when we need them the most. Supporting these credits is about securing a prosperous future for all Australians, especially those in Western Australia who rely on these industries for their livelihoods. The opposition have an opportunity here, not just to support government initiatives but to stand with Australian workers and businesses striving for growth and stability. By advocating for production tax credits, they can help ensure that Western Australia continues to thrive as an economic powerhouse while providing secure employment opportunities for thousands of families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, let us acknowledge the significant progress made together as a nation. The creation of over one million jobs is a testament to our resilience and commitment to building a stronger economy. As we look forward to the future, let us continue supporting policies that empower our workforce and invest in Western Australia as the engine room of our economy. Together, we can ensure that every Australian has access to secure employment and a bright future—a future where innovation flourishes, communities prosper and our collective potential is realised. Let us unite across party lines to champion initiatives benefiting not only Western Australia but all Australians. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  On Saturday, when I was out doorknocking in the Parkwood area, a suburb in my electorate of Tangney, I was proud to share with my many constituents what the Albanese Labor government has done for Western Australia. Every single one of the 1.5 million WA taxpayers, including the 87,000 in Tangney, has received a tax cut, and every single one of the 1.1 million households has received energy bill relief. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know Australians are doing it tough. We are doing everything we can to help to take the pressure off the cost of living—cheaper child care, cheaper medicine and a stronger Medicare. In my electorate of Tangney, the bulk-billing rate has increased by 2.5 per cent thanks to this government's record investing in bulk-billing. That means Tangney residents have had an additional 20,633 bulk-billed visits. Tangney residents have also saved more than $8 million on more than 80,000 cheaper scripts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Albanese Labor government more than 1.1 million jobs have been created. Unemployment is now four per cent. There is record participation and widespread job creation. Wages are growing. And we have made substantial progress on inflation. It is the first time in 50 years that Australia has had unemployment at four per cent or better at the same time as inflation has been below three per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia is a key part of the Australia's economy. The world is changing, and the pace of change is getting faster. The global transition to net zero is the biggest transformation of the global economy since the Industrial Revolution. Our $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia policy will help us grasp a new generation of opportunities and bring the jobs and prosperity of the future to every part of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia is front and centre when it comes to a future made in Australia. The Future Made in Australia plans build the foundation for a better future in Australia. It is about the many industrial and economic opportunities that come with the big global shift to net zero. It is about attracting and enabling investment, making Australia a leader in renewable energy and adding value to our resources. It is about science and innovation, skills and training to build Australia's future workforce, and investing in our people and places. Nothing could be more important to that than refining the lithium which will be such an important part of battery power and battery storage into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia has a central role to play in refining and processing critical minerals. Our production tax incentives are about more investment and more jobs in Australia's resources sector. These tax credits are about ensuring that local communities benefit as the world transitions to net zero. The legislation will give investors clarity and certainty to invest in Australia's potential to add more value to its natural resources and help deliver cheaper and cleaner energy. We want to drive private sector investment in new industries through production tax incentives for green hydrogen and processed critical minerals, structured in a way that the taxpayer pays only when an industry succeeds. This will help make Australia an indispensable part of the net zero economy of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are backing Australian ideas, innovation and science. We will create a new industry that will create new, secure jobs in the resource sector, and we will train the workforce of the future. This is standing up for Western Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this is not the first time I have risen in this House to put a national spotlight on the rural doctor shortage crisis that is having such a shocking impact on the health of residents in the Central West region of New South Wales and country communities around Australia. Put simply, our communities are at breaking point. The situation can only be described as catastrophic, and I will continue to speak on this crisis until immediate and real action takes place to fix it. Country people have shorter life expectancies than city people. It's both tragic and utterly unacceptable, but it's true, and there is no end in sight as this health crisis worsens every day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 May last year, I raised this crisis as a matter of public importance, calling on the urgent need for the government to immediately address the shortage of doctors in rural and regional Australia and deliver better health services for all Australians regardless of their postcode. In October last year, I started the End the Rural Doctor Shortage Crisis petition, calling on the Australian government to immediately fix the rural doctor shortage crisis and deliver more doctors to the bush without delay. The petition quickly gained over 13,000 signatures. On 10 October last year, I rose in question time to inform the Minister for Health and Aged Care about smaller towns in our electorate, such as Gulgong, that are being left without doctors and those that are closing their books to new patients. Book closures are happening in smaller communities, such as Molong and Canowindra, but also larger ones, such as Mudgee, Orange and Bathurst. The waiting time to see a GP in Wellington is now about two months. The pressure on our doctors, emergency departments and communities is immense.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November last year I again raised this issue in question time, where I highlighted the unfolding crisis and asked the minister when this appalling situation would be fixed and if he would come to the region to meet with local doctors and concerned residents to see the shocking effects this crisis is having. On 25 November last year I introduced my Doctors for the Bush Bill 2024 in the parliament. This bill was simple and straightforward and would have once again ensured that country areas had priority for overseas trained doctors, who would have to work there for up to 10 years. It would have alleviated the rural doctor shortage crisis, ensuring equitable health care for rural, regional and remote Australians. Unbelievably, the National Party, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party all failed to support the bill. This was extremely disappointing, particularly with respect to the National Party. They say they want action to get more doctors to the bush but don't vote that way in parliament. My bill would have given country areas the same priority for overseas trained doctors that they had before the 2022 election. In other words, it was the previous Liberal and National parties' policy, and they still refused to vote for it in this House. It's yet more proof of a party losing its way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This unfolding rural health crisis secured further national attention when, on 17 December last year, <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Current Affair</span> aired a story on the crisis. We heard from local Mudgee GP Dr Edward Lee, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is at a crisis level. It's a disaster for the patients of Mudgee and the surrounding regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Mudgee resident suffering from end-of-life emphysema and asthma said, 'It's like living in a third-world country.' When asked how this made her feel, she responded:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, my end might be coming a bit quicker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I've had constructive conversations with the Minister for Health and Aged Care and also the assistant minister, I again bring this issue to the House because urgent action is needed now. This rural doctor shortage crisis is a disgrace. Country people are being treated as second-class citizens. Immediate action is needed, and I call on this House to take it as a matter of urgency. I'm very pleased that the member for Mayo is joining me to second this motion because she knows how devastating this crisis is for country patients and country communities. Action is needed on both sides of the aisle, and I call on all members of this House to support this motion. I commend it to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I thank the member for Calare for putting forward this motion. Politicians like a quick fix. There is no quick fix to this problem, which has evolved over the last 40 or 50 years. And there are many causes. I approached the Minister for Health and Aged Care when I was first elected in 2016 to describe to him the difficulty that disadvantaged areas, outer metropolitan areas and rural and regional areas were having in attracting general practitioners. The member for Calare was a member of the government at that stage. That government did nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have watched the situation get much, much worse since then. Unfortunately, rural GP training positions were not being filled. More and more GPs were leaving the bush and rural areas. They were also leaving outer metropolitan areas, for a whole a variety of reasons. Health care has become very complex. You need to be highly trained over a whole range of disciplines to become a general practitioner these days. The member for Mackellar here well knows that. People need to train for long periods of time. They need a lot of supports in place to practise 21st century medicine. In rural areas, that's often very difficult to find. Skilled nurses, skilled allied health professionals, IT specialists, communication specialists and pharmacists are very difficult to obtain in rural and regional areas, but also in outer metropolitan areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I approached the Minister for Health in the Liberal-National government multiple times about this. Members of the Department of Health were often present in our discussions. Very little has changed. The Labor government has put in place a significant number of changes. It has increased the number of rural clinical schools. I paid my respects to the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton, who did his very best when he was the Minister for Regional Health, Regional Communications and Local Government in the previous government to try and improve that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, in northern Australia, we added more medical schools to try and encourage more local training of medical practitioners. In 2024, for the first time, the number of rural training positions for GPs was fully filled. That's after almost a decade of those training positions not being filled. So there's a combination of problems, including complex medicine and the importance of having supports for medical practitioners in rural and regional areas and outer metropolitan areas. There may be difficulties in moving a family to a rural or remote area, such as the lack of supports available through the health system, which have led to difficulty in attracting people to these areas. Unfortunately, as I've said, the difficulties continue. It is important that every level of politics—from local government to state government to federal government—is involved in improving access to health care in the bush. It's going to involve novel, innovative solutions as we move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicine in the 21st century is very complex. For a general practitioner in a rural area, it includes training in emergency medicine, child health, geriatrics, cardiology; expertise in genomics and genetics; and access to more-complex pharmaceuticals. These are highly complex positions, and we need innovative solutions. It's not just about training more GPs and getting more GPs to move to the bush; it's about improving social conditions and giving general practitioners access to sabbaticals. It's about retraining GPs in teaching hospitals on a temporary basis. It involves getting them access to schooling for their children and work for their spouse. It involves a whole lot of modalities, and there is no quick fix. No matter what anyone wants, there is no quick fix.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">General practice is a highly complex field these days, and people require a lot of training and a lot of support, more so in rural areas, where there may not be other general practitioners to help them. We need to encourage more people to move to areas of disadvantage, and this may involve significant expenditure.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  I rise to support the member for Calare's motion. I also acknowledge many of the comments made by the member for Macarthur. No, there are no easy fixes, but there are fixes. There are ways that we can address this. In my electorate, access to health services is one of the top three most pressing issues. We know that there is a $6.55 billion shortfall in regional and rural health spend. That means that around $848 per person is the difference between what is spent on a person living in metropolitan Australia and what is spent on a person living in rural Australia, and we most certainly feel it in the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While many say, 'Yes, these are problems we've had for several years,' the changes to distribution priority areas, or DPAs, have made it infinitely worse. In South Australia, an overseas doctor can go and work in Mitcham, a very nice, well-heeled area, instead of going out to the bush, and that is what they are doing. They are living in North Adelaide and working in Elizabeth. They are living in Unley and working in Morphett Vale. They're living in Mitcham and working in Mitcham. They are not going to the bush. That is something that changed with the change of government, and that has had a profound impact on my electorate. I'm in a region. I can only imagine what it's like out in Grey or Lingiari, way out west.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, what that's meant is that we've had closures in Meadows and Yankalilla. These are clinics that have closed. We have had historic shortages across Kangaroo Island. It has taken weeks—sometimes a month—to get in to see a doctor. On the Fleurieu and the south coast, where the median age is north of 60, the doctors have closed their books. They're saying, 'Well, we're not putting anyone on, because we can't get any doctors into the region.' I've written to the health minister about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are the solutions? What do the general practitioners tell us are the solutions? Just over a week ago, we had a general practitioners register forum in my electorate. I co-hosted this. It was the SA Future GP Forum, held in McLaren Vale. They talked about a number of issues, and they also, importantly, came up with solutions. We know that some time ago—maybe 10 or 15 years ago—around 50 per cent of medical students were looking to go into general practice. Now that's down to 10 per cent. There are a few reasons for this. One of the reasons is the cost difference. If you are a registrar and you want to go down the GP pathway, you have a shortfall of about $30,000 every year in costs. If you stay in the hospital and work as a registrar in a hospital setting, you get access to study leave and paternity leave, as well as that difference in income. That is a real barrier to people who want to be GPs going and doing the study to become GPs. So we need to address that. That funding was cut in 2014, and it hasn't been brought back since then. That, I think, has had a huge impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue is that we haven't lifted Commonwealth supported places to study medicine in pretty much a decade. Again, the number was frozen in 2014 and governments of both persuasions have not lifted it. We need to seriously lift the number of medical places, because our population has grown substantially but we've only seen very marginal increases. I think that in the last couple of years there have been maybe 100 extra places across the nation to study medicine, while we have an ageing population. These are two very simple policy matters that are contained and can be addressed. Those things could change One sits in education and one sits with the health minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I support the member for Calare's motion in saying that this is a critical issue. If, as people do in some parts of my electorate, you live an hour or an hour and a quarter from the city and you can't get in to see a GP, or you move to the area and the GP says, 'We're not even going to add you to our books,' that is a very serious issue. The brunt of the impact of this is in regional Australia. It's not in Mitcham, Morphett Vale or Elizabeth. This is in the regions, and the regions must have this addressed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  I'm very happy to speak on this private member's motion, and I want to highlight the challenges of peri-urban areas like mine, which sit in a bit of a no man's land between urban and regional. In fact, the region I represent is a mix of urban, regional, rural and remote in its character and geography, with small towns, hamlets, villages and large properties that mean it is not a one-size-fits-all place. No single model of primary care is going to suit my constituents, and that means we really need to break down the issues area by area. Remember that this is something that the Minister for Health and Aged Care has described as a crisis. We have a crisis because of the failure to invest in this very key part of primary care for so many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first region I want to focus on is the Blue Mountains, which sits anywhere from 60 kilometres to 120 kilometres from the Sydney CBD. I recently held a roundtable with consumers in Katoomba, towards the top of the mountains, about their experiences, and then I held a separate roundtable with GPs and practice managers. Both of these groups provided enormous insights into their experiences and their challenges. I'm really grateful to all those who participated, and I also want to thank the Nepean Blue Mountains Primary Health Network representatives who were there, given their role as an agent for distributing Commonwealth funding to primary health care at a local level. There are a range of issues, and they include the constraints of the Modified Monash Model that the previous government brought in. It applies only to the very top of the mountain. That's the bit that gets incentives. Yet, a few kilometres down the road, the town of Katoomba does not attract those incentives. That is our key population base, but the model really constrains the services. There are a whole range of challenges that we face locally and nationally that I'm going to continue to work on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has emerged is the issue of access for those with a chronic illness or chronic condition who are experiencing problems in getting ongoing continuity of care. The steps we're taking are to look at the health system as a whole, to look at the role that nurse practitioners can have and to look at the role that pharmacies can have, so that people are working to what we call the top of their scope, the top of their ability, and getting extra training where it's needed. That might mean giving these people Medicare item numbers to deliver certain things. It's making sure that, whether it's contraceptives, treatments for UTIs or immunisation, pharmacists are able to service that part of the healthcare system. These are all things that take the pressure off GPs so that they can see the people that only they can see. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to see that, in 2025, a record 1,750 offers are likely to be made to junior doctors to begin government funded GP training and that a huge chunk of those have already been taken up. We've certainly seen bulk-billing rates turn around with, in the 2023 budget, the biggest investment in bulk billing in that 40-year history of Medicare, and in the last two years we've delivered the two largest increases to Medicare rebates in 30 years. In our two-and-a-bit years, we've increased rebates by more than those opposite did in nine long years. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that is helping in the lower part of the mountains is the opening of the urgent care clinic in Penrith, and, while it's not ideal for lower-mountains people to travel down off the mountain, it is understood that that does provide more options for them compared to those higher up the mountains. I know parents of young children have been particularly grateful for that Medicare urgent clinic down in Penrith, which I opened the year before last. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about why one is needed so badly in the Hawkesbury. The Hawkesbury desperately needs a Medicare urgent care clinic because people don't have the same access to the existing ones. This would be a walk-in mini-emergency clinic for urgent but not life-threatening conditions, with radiology there open seven days a week, 365 days a year, usually from eight in the morning till eight at night, so that everybody knows where to go when something urgent but not life-threatening happens. I know my community wants this because 1,600 people have already signed my petition in support of this. I will keep advocating this as something that can be a real life-saver for parents who don't want to be in the emergency department and want to get good, urgently needed care for their kids.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight this government's strong commitment to its apprentices. Right now is a great time to start an apprenticeship in Australia. Sparkies, plumbers, chippies, mechanics, landscapers, painters, brickies, boilies, fitters and so many more other workers that keep our economy booming are all vital trades that begin with an apprenticeship. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came into government three years ago, Australia was facing a severe skills shortage. This shortage spanned numerous trades and industries, holding our economy back and limiting growth opportunities for the business sector across Australia. When I speak to businesses in the Hunter they tell me that the lack of skilled workers is stifling their ability to expand. Whether they're in mining, viticulture or manufacturing, businesses are struggling to find the workers they desperately need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We listen to what businesses are telling us, and that's why addressing the skills shortage has been one of our highest priorities. We knew it wouldn't be an overnight fix. Instead we've made a long-term investment in growing our skilled workforce by opening up pathways to education and training and making apprenticeships more attractive. Through long-term investment, we are steadily closing the skills gap. We've rebuilt the TAFE system and provided apprentices with the support they need to succeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had to rebuild the TAFE system because, unfortunately, those opposite left TAFE in ruins. They gutted funding, leaving the system on its knees. Is it any wonder that these reckless cuts led to a skills shortage? Without a strong TAFE system, how can we train the workers our economy needs? Those opposite like to think they understand the economy better, but their actions tell a different story. By slashing TAFE funding and making apprenticeships harder to complete, they discouraged people from entering the trades, making the skills crisis even worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have a long way to go, but this government is committed to ending the skills shortage by supporting apprentices at every stage. Recently we announced even more initiatives to further support apprentices. We are providing up to $10,000 in incentive payments for apprentices to keep them in key residential construction trades. We have also increased the allowance for apprentices living away from home—the first increase in over 20 years. Those opposite have shown their true colours and have said these investments are wasteful spending. Their flawed logic suggests that, by cutting TAFE funding and slashing apprenticeship support, skilled workers somehow would just appear. When they did make cuts, they didn't re-invest that saving. Instead, they handed millions of taxpayers' dollars to their big-business mates—$72 million to McDonald's and $1.6 million to a single Domino's franchisee, who later was banned from employing apprentices for failing to meet training obligations. And although I do love a good burger, I don't think the previous government should have wasted $28 million in taxpayers' money on the Grill'd burger chain. That money should have been spent directly on supporting apprentices as they gained the skills to help power our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the opposition makes life harder for apprentices because they look down on people who don't have a university degree. I've had coalition supporters tell me that I'm not educated. They mock me for dropping out of school. But I'm proud that I went to TAFE. I'm proud that I chose a job where I could work with my hands. It takes all types of workers to build a strong advanced economy like the one that we have here in Australia. All Australian workers deserve respect and should be supported in pursuing the career of their dreams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, I spoke with Jackson, who's a young chippie from the Hunter. He told me that without the government's support he wouldn't have been able to afford the tools and training he needed to complete his apprenticeship. Thanks to our investment in TAFE and apprenticeship incentives, Jackson is now on track to becoming a fully qualified carpenter, helping to build the homes and infrastructure in our community. Completing an apprenticeship is more than just learning technical skills. It's about developing confidence, building connections and preparing for a successful career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why TAFE is so important. It gives apprentices the opportunity to learn from experienced professionals and gain valuable insights that will help set them up for long-term success. I'm proud to stand here as a member of a government that values and respects apprentices—a government that is making their lives easier, not harder. We are building the workforce Australia needs to end the skills shortage and to make our country the best place it can be. To those that look down on tradies, honestly, shame on you. Tradies are the ones that build your houses. They're the ones that cut your hair and cut your kids' hair. They're the ones that do the concreting. They're the ones that do all the work where people get their hands dirty for the ones that don't want that. Shame on you for looking down on them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I thank the member for Hunter for bringing this motion because it gives me an opportunity to say to the member for Hunter that I am similarly very proud of him—that he went through the vocational education training sector. I'm similarly very supportive of that sector, as it is the sector that builds Australia. I have said in this place a couple of times how proud I am of my first-born son, who has just commenced a plumbing apprenticeship. I am certainly very supportive of the skills and training sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue that I have, though, with the government's approach to this sector is that it only ever talks about TAFE. We hear 'fee-free TAFE', and for the reasons I'm going to set out shortly, the fee-free TAFE legislation is simply not going to do what it was designed to do, because, yet again, Labor loves the big slogan, the big headline, 'It's all going to be free.' But over and over again, their delivery on policy demonstrates that they cannot deliver that that they proclaim so loudly through a megaphone. Data released by the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research has confirmed that, instead of trending up, as we were under the former coalition government, Australia has lost over 80,000 apprentices and trainees from the national training pipeline since the Albanese Labor government took office. Why is it that the government will only fund TAFE? Why do we just hear, 'TAFE, TAFE, TAFE, TAFE, TAFE'? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On our side of the House, we support students who wish to go into vocational education and training if they want to go and get that training from a private registered operator. For example, I've met with the National Electrical and Communications Association. They currently have between 500 and 600 apprentices on their books in the carpentry and building trades. There is no funding available to this organisation from the fee-free TAFE legislation, but this organisation has a 90 per cent apprenticeship completion rate. TAFE has a 50 per cent completion rate. I've also met with the Master Plumbers NSW, and I give a big shout-out to CEO Nate Smith. He said that his operation has an 80 per cent success rate in getting their plumbing apprentices through. Compare that to the rate at TAFE of 50 per cent. In April last year, Master Plumbers NSW wrote to the then skills minister, Brendan O'Connor, and sought joint funding to establish a new skills and training centre out in Western Sydney. The response was completely unequivocal. It appears that the government, who spouts their support for this industry, will not support Western Sydney in having anything other than TAFE-provided funding. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that the coalition is opposing Labor's TAFE-only approach is that we support all students in this sector, not just some. We'll back every single student, regardless of whether they are training at a TAFE or at an independent provider, because, on this side of the House, we are about providing people with choice. A student who's starting vocational education or training should, if they are going to receive government funding, be able to avail themselves of the choice to either go to TAFE or go through a private operator. Why does this government so dislike private operations? Why do they not support anything other than a heavily unionised TAFE workforce? We are very concerned about Commonwealth funding, taxpayers' money, that only directs resources to one particular training model, and it's a training model that is not nearly as successful as training models developed through the private sector. I'm certainly not saying that TAFE should be defunded; I'm saying that the private sector should be equally well funded. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  As one of the few members of parliament who actually went from school straight into a trade, I can testify to the importance of apprenticeships, especially for young Australians to establish themselves in a workforce and as an opportunity further educate yourself. Some of the best lessons I've learnt, even in this place, were learnt on the factory floor when dealing with migrants and the unfair treatment that they received during that time. You also start to realise the importance of apprenticeships and how short-changed they are. They're working for sometimes 25 to 30 per cent less than the person standing next to them doing exactly the same job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has long been the party for the worker and for training, and TAFE is so important. It's important right across all fields, no matter what field you look at, which is why I shake my head when I listen to those opposite talking down TAFE and saying, 'It's no good; we should look at registered training providers.' Well, during the Morrison-Turnbull-Abbott mess we saw the important issues that people faced through the dodginess of some of the RTOs that were costing millions of dollars and not delivering anything. It's important right across, no matter what fields you look at, which is why I shake my head when I listen to those opposite talking down TAFE, saying that it's no good and that we should look at registered training providers. We saw during the Morrison-Turnbull-Abbott mess the important issues that people faced through the dodginess of some of the RTOs that were costing millions of dollars and not delivering anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If trade training was important to those opposite, why would they shut down trade training centres like, in my home state of Victoria, a trade training centre that actually encompassed the use of independent and public schools to train kids in things like building, construction—the workforce shortage we've had, which has helped create the mess that we were left with when we came into government—and automotive. And we know what happened with the automotive sector, when Joe Hockey stood in parliament and pushed Holden out of Australia while his Liberal mate in Victoria, Dave Hodgett, was sitting in the foyer at GMH trying to support the automotive industry. That's what we had. They did not care about trades. They never have, and they never will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We wouldn't have the shortage we have if they'd kept trade training centres open, with the ability for kids in country areas to actually access trades and utilise different services at different schools. Assumption College had a fantastic commercial kitchen, so those that were learning the culinary trades could go there, no matter what school they went to. If you were into automotive, you could go to Seymore College or Whittlesea—same as you could go to Whittlesea, Broadford or other places to learn about building. That's a generation of children that went through school, became adults and didn't get access to the great support of TAFE or to the educational opportunities that they could have had if the former government not blown the budget that badly and destroyed training in Victoria and across the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of TAFE can never be underestimated. It's there for a fantastic reason—the opportunity to help kids build a great future and then have a great career. That's why it's important that we've committed to the $10,000 incentive payment for Australians going through construction apprenticeships—because we have a crisis in housing in this country, a crisis that started back in late 2017. It was at that time that we were talking about a housing crisis. I think the words used by those opposite were 'get rich parents'. I remember that strongly; under Turnbull, it was 'get rich parents'. That was your way to get a house. That was their excuse. The Leader of the Opposition is living testament to this; the only way he could get a house was through rich parents. But not everyone has rich parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunity to learn a trade, go out, forge your own career and build in this country was savagely cut over the nearly six years that they were in government. That has become a national disgrace. We need to import workers to do the work while the training begins, but, at the same time, we're got those opposite saying that we shouldn't be doing that either. They don't want to train people. They don't want to bring people in to do the job. But they'll sit there and complain about a housing crisis that they were very heavily involved in starting in the first place. The housing crisis didn't start on 22 May; it started a long time ago. But it really raised its head in 2017, and those opposite put their heads in the sand and did nothing about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting apprenticeships is so important for a whole range of things. The member for Hunter went through before the different trades that people need. When we look at every facet of life, we've got great apprentices that have been trained and gone on to successful careers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to have done my apprenticeship. I went to the Collingwood TAFE—although you try to avoid anything with Collingwood! It was a great learning curve to go there and meet hundreds of different people from across the state and from similar situations, learning. Sadly, we've seen a lot of the trades disappear off our shores. I was in the footwear and clothing industry, and that's now gone overseas. There's only a handful of small manufacturers here today. We've got to bring them back if we want to end our skills crisis. We must fix up our issues in relation to supply chains; we've got to start doing more here. It's this government—the Albanese government—that's actually enabling apprenticeships in this nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  The member for Hunter brings to this chamber a motion about apprentices, and, despite the member for McEwen's protestations, which rubbished the coalition and rubbished good old 'Collingwood forever'—I'm not quite sure what he's got against the Magpie supporters—when you look back at the years, particularly of the Morrison government, what you see is delivery. What you saw in those nine years was a government with a laserlike focus on making sure that our apprentices had the very best environment so that they could not just survive but thrive—so that they could be their best selves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we had in those final couple of years of the Morrison government—certainly 18 months—was a global pandemic, a worldwide shutdown not seen since 1919. Not since the end of World War I had the planet been subjected to economic conditions like that. The Great Depression was obviously a great setback, but the 1919 flu caused so much heartache and disruption as well to the economic fortunes of many nations which then went into the Great Depression. Those years of the 1920s and early 1930s were shocking, just dreadful. During the pandemic of 2020, 1.1 million jobs were created—not necessarily by government, because government doesn't create jobs; it's private enterprise that creates jobs. Under our watch, under our stewardship—three years of delivery under the government of the former member for Cook—there were 220,000 trade apprenticeships and 1,213 major transport projects, supporting 100,000 jobs. It went from $110 billion to $120 billion of investment. I mention that because all too often our truckies are forgotten when we're talking about people who do the hard yards for this nation. We should be applauding our truck drivers, because they keep the nation going. People often say it's not a skill; I defy anybody to back one of those B-doubles or larger vehicles into the tight nooks and crannies of supermarket yards where they do the distribution of food and other goods. I defy anybody to be able to do it. They can, they do, and we owe them a debt of gratitude. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hunter, in his notes on this particular bill, talks about $72 billion going to McDonald's. I always like to see somebody with McDonald's on their CV, because you know they're going to turn up on time. You know they're going to be disciplined. You know they're going to do the right thing. Why he's picked on Macca's, I do not know. I do not understand that. The point about fee-free TAFE is a bit of a furphy, because those other private providers do such a great job. Yes, in competition with TAFE, they've been neglected by this government. They've been overlooked by this government. Their efforts have been overshadowed by this government. We need to do the very best we can for apprentices. One of the first things that we can do for apprentices is reduce the cost of living. But those opposite forgot about the cost of living. They didn't talk about the cost of living for the first 18 months they were in office. It was only after they lost the referendum for the Voice that they all of a sudden realised that people were hurting, particularly apprentices. Those apprentices who are just getting out into their own profession need every tax break and every bit of help they can get. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, when Prime Minister, brought in a great 'tools of the trade' benefit so that they could get the tools with which they could do their occupations and do them well. We have always had incentives in there for our apprentices. It's only a coalition government that will look after apprentices. It's only a coalition government that will address the cost-of-living pressures that apprentices are under.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  Today I stand in strong support of this motion recognising the Albanese government's steadfast commitment to supporting apprentices and rebuilding our trade sector, addressing the crucial skill shortage created by the previous government, neglecting investment in TAFE and trades as vital for our country's future. Many of us know that for everyday Australians real opportunity is far more than a talking point; it can be the difference between scraping by and setting a solid foundation for the future. I have lived that reality myself. Before I set foot in this chamber, I spent 15 years baking and stacking shelves, and it showed me what a genuine chance at training and a stable income can mean for a person's life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we took office, we inherited a TAFE system that had been neglected for over a decade. We also inherited a workforce sorely lacking in skilled tradespeople—a gap that was holding back our economy and denying Australians the chance to learn secure and rewarding skills. That's why we've made it a priority to invest in our trades and TAFE system. Through the National Skills Agreement, we are delivering a historic $12.6 billion investment to rebuild TAFE. This agreement, signed with states and territories, will provide 300,000 fee-free TAFE places in areas in critical need, including aged care, child care and the digital economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also made free TAFE permanent because we believe that every Australian deserves the opportunity to gain the skills they need to build a better future. Free TAFE has already helped over 355,000 Australians access training since its introduction. Making it permanent ensures that this opportunity will be available for generations to come. We are guaranteeing 100,000 new TAFE places focused on areas of national skill shortage each and every year going forward. This is to ensure more Australians can access quality training in areas where we need skilled workers most. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Holt, I've spoken to apprentices forced to juggle two jobs just to keep their training going. Some told me they had to pull out of their apprenticeships altogether when the cost of daily life—rent, bills, travel—became way too expensive. That's why we are introducing the housing construction apprenticeship program. This will provide a $10,000 incentive to apprentices in residential construction trades. This means that someone who wants to become a plumber or a bricklayer will have extra support. We will also increase the allowance for apprentices who live away from home—the first significant increase in over 20 years. This boost is necessary to support tradies to finish their courses. This means better support for the workers we need to keep building homes and to address the housing shortage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are taking these measures because we know we need a strong TAFE sector to build our country's future, to revitalise our manufacturing sector and to start making things right here in this country, and to build the homes our country needs for the future. By lifting our apprentices, we are also lifting up the families and local businesses that rely on their income and expertise. For too long, the Liberals have neglected our trades sector. While they call free TAFE 'wasteful spending', they are more than happy for the government to fund billions for corporate lunches. This really shows their priorities. Labor knows a strong trades sector means a strong economy. A strong economy means more opportunities for all Australians. Unlike the Liberals, Labor will never take our TAFE sector for granted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by acknowledging the dedication of the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese; the Minister for Skills and Training, Andrew Giles; and Brendan O'Connor for driving these reforms. </span>

                  </a>  Six foot eight and three foot wide—but you've got more front than David Jones to bring this motion before the Federation Chamber talking down the coalition's record on apprentices. Seriously! Under the coalition, we saw 220,000 apprentices in the 2019-to-2022 term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this hapless, hopeless, helpless government came into power, we've seen 80,000 fewer apprentices, and, shockingly, 44,000 of those apprentices are women. Apparently Labor's 'the party for women', yet they don't care about 44,000 women who have lost apprenticeships. These aren't just statistics; these are real people—real lives and real dreams crushed. So please don't file motions where you haven't done the research as to who the better government is not only for trades but also for apprentices and small business.</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying before the division, what we've seen in the last term of Labor is 80,000 fewer apprentices than in the last term that the coalition was in government, between 2019 and 2022. But it's no surprise, because what we've seen due to Labor's policies is the closure of 27,000 small and medium businesses—27,000. You can imagine how many people had worked for those small and medium businesses. The owners, who have put everything on the line—mortgaged homes, overdrafts—are sent to the wall because of Labor's policies. Of those 27,000, 7,000 are construction companies. That is the highest number ever of closures of construction companies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do those companies do? They generally hire apprentices. I can tell you from personal experience in and around Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour—I talked to the tradies because my 17-year-old son is in year 12 at Newman Senior Technical College because he wants to become a tradie and go into construction—they're not hiring. They're not putting on apprentices, because they're worried about the economy. The cost of living has hit hard in those industries. The cost of materials has gone through the roof. Why? Because of the policies of this government. Because of the all-in renewables, we have seen gas and electricity prices go through the roof. That hurts small and medium businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the tradies are worried. They're not putting on apprentices. We've seen fewer apprentices over the past three years. Then the Albanese government comes out with this $10,000 incentive payment for apprentices who are living out of home. I said to my son, 'Do you know any apprentice who doesn't live at home with mum and dad?' Now, he's got a fairly large network of mates; the answer is 'no'. All spin, no substance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would be better off going back to the coalition policy where we funded the employer 50 per cent of the apprentice's first-year wage, then 10 per cent in the second year and five per cent in the third year because we know—as much as I love our young apprentices—you're next to useless in your first year, you know what you're doing in your second, and you actually make money for your employer in the third. These are the incentives that we need to bring back. We need to bring back our policy. If you want to see more houses, if you want to see more apprentices, then vote for the coalition at the next election. </span>

This is what TAFE does exactly. It assists people to skill up; to learn different trades; to, perhaps at a particular time in their life, go and upskill; and to ensure that they can contribute to long-term economic growth in our nation. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the history of TAFE, it has helped and served thousands of people in Australia. My own family is no exception. My son is a plumber. He went through TAFE and did his plumbing certificates et cetera. It has served him very well. I'm a product of TAFE; I didn't go to university. I finished year 12 and went back to TAFE later on in life to upskill and get certain certificates, and here I am today. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our TAFE and our higher education play an important role. As I said, a better educated workforce drives innovation, productivity and long-term economic growth. This is particularly important to my electorate of Adelaide and to my home state of South Australia because we know that South Australia has a commitment to build naval nuclear powered submarines. We know they will be built in South Australia, so we need skills and trades. We need to prepare for it and to be ready with those skills and trades so that the workforce that's needed will be there. We know that South Australia will create up to 4,000 jobs—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion as it is critical that the skills shortage is not only understood but addressed. The Flynn electorate is full of qualified trade professionals, including electricians, plumbers, welders, carpenters, automotive service technicians and mechanics, painters, nurses, dental hygienists, chefs, bakers, hairdressers, bus drivers and child educators, just to name a few. According to the 2021 census, over 30 per cent of people over 15 in the Flynn electorate have a certificate III, certificate IV, an advanced diploma or a diploma in technical and trade skills. The Flynn electorate's top response for occupation is also technicians and trade workers. Before entering politics, I was a boilermaker—a high-pressure pipe welder working on the gas pipelines to Curtis Island, near Gladstone. Many years ago, I went to Roma TAFE College and received my qualifications in engineering through recognised prior learning. Sadly, since my time, it has become harder and harder for apprentices and trainees to come through the system and into the workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, here are the facts that Labor don't want you to know about. There are fewer Australians being skilled under the Labor government. Australia has lost over 80,300 apprentices and trainees, a loss of one in five. There are 34,685 fewer women apprentices and trainees in training, and new starts for women in skills have nearly halved, a loss of 44,605 equivalent places. There are fewer trade apprentices in training with a 25 per cent drop of new starts, and there are fewer construction trade apprentices in training with a 26 per cent drop in new starts. Skills shortages have worsened since the Albanese government took office and remain higher today than under the coalition. From June 2022 to June 2023, skills shortages increased by 12.5 per cent, and the latest data indicates 33 per cent of all occupations are in shortage, which is higher than under the coalition government. More than 27,000 businesses have gone insolvent since the Albanese government was elected, and Labor's economic failures have made it harder than ever to put on an apprentice or a trainee. With issues such as the skills shortage, it is incredibly important that we start to think outside the box and address this significant problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One massive issue is the lack of childcare providers, and this is particularly relevant to small communities throughout Australia. In an industry that employs 200,000 people, 21,000 more qualified professionals are required to address the current shortage. Another 18,000 must be hired to meet future demand. An additional 18,000 will be needed to help realise the federal government's childcare subsidy and expanded preschool plans. This was all found in the federal government's report released in 2024. Furthermore, if Australia wants to improve children's development by offering universal preschool, the early childhood education industry will have to grow by three per cent every year. It is clear as day that the childcare sector is struggling not only to attract but to retain workers. One idea that I've raised that is worth looking into is providing recognition of prior learning for parents and grandparents to attain qualifications to become childcare educators. I had a history of welding which is recognised, and I don't understand why the same can't be applied for the parents and grandparents with respect to the childcare sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one-size-fits-all approach on education is not working and most certainly does not work in rural and regional Australia. We need a government to prioritise the valued tradies and workers, including in our skilled migration intake. For example, Labor has failed to build the homes Australians need and failed to manage the immigration system in a way that provides the right workers to help supplement the meeting of this demand. Instead, this Labor government is putting martial arts and yoga instructors ahead of skilled workers, including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers and stonemasons, in the visa queue. The Albanese government's own data makes it clear they have made skills shortages worse and have delivered the worst skills shortage in 50 years. How can a Labor government bring one million people to Australia and have a skills shortage?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has outlined our plan to train our next generation of Australians with the skills required for the workforce of the future, address the supply chain constraints and invest in skills and development, while creating more apprenticeships and traineeships and ensuring the training system is delivering the skills Australians need. Only the coalition has this plan to address this skills shortage and get Australia back on track.</span>

There will be a minority government. The Greens could hold the balance of power. And, if someone says the Greens can't deliver, then show them this. We don't just imagine what we can do; we are already working to do it. Just this term, we've secured an extra $3½ billion for public and social housing, environmental protections for water, the right to disconnect outside work hours, 20 per cent off HECS debts and $1.7 billion for clean energy. And we're just getting started.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last time there was minority government, we got dental for kids into Medicare—that was the Greens—and world-leading climate legislation as well. Now we can do it again. Labor has shown that, when it's in majority, it won't tackle the big problems we face; it just tinkers around the edges. But the Liberals want to copy Trump, tear the whole place up and put the billionaires in charge.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want real change. We want bold, real change which puts people above the profits of big corporations. We want to tax billionaires and big corporations to fund the things that our communities need: dental in Medicare, a rent freeze, cheaper groceries and being able to see the GP for free. The Greens will keep Dutton out and get Labor to act. The age of the two-party system is over. It's time to hold the major parties and their billionaire backers accountable. If you want change, vote for it.</span>

This year's theme is 'Accelerate Action', and that is something that our government has been doing since we were elected in 2022. We've been working really hard and getting results in closing the gender pay gap, we've introduced a really ambitious national plan to end gendered violence within a generation, and there have been many more achievements—too many to mention here—to make a more equal Australia.</span>

I've had women's health forums with locals. I held a round table with the Monash Women's Health Alliance and the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ged Kearney, to talk about the health issues facing women today. The announcement made just in the last few days that we will see the first PBS listing in more than 30 years for new oral contraceptive pills is remarkable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  Across the country there are thousands of entrepreneurial businesses making a difference to everyday Australians. One such business in my electorate of Mayo is DreamsEdge, a small Australian company working on innovative technology for elder support. The fantastic work of small technology companies is often drowned out by the chorus of gratitude towards large companies and international consulting companies. Consequently, many of the wonderful advances in technology created by small to medium companies goes unnoticed, and it fails to be adopted by government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">DreamsEdge focuses on technology that helps older Australians to stay in their homes safely and also assists in residential aged-care facilities. Their platforms use AI sensors to monitor residents and communicate with residents to optimise carer and ambulance response times in emergencies. It monitors health indicators, like heart, pulse and breathing rates, and also whether someone has had a fall. It creates alerts when predictive indicators are triggered. It also automates data collection for staff roster management and for reporting healthcare providers' quarterly statistics to the Department of Health and Ageing. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">DreamsEdge was founded by technologists who wanted to support their own ageing parents, and it is now improving the safety and the quality of life of older Australians. So congratulations and well done to DreamsEdge, and thank you for coming and meeting with me in my electorate. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  The Albanese Labor government is not just getting wages moving and reducing inflation; we're supporting more local jobs in Ipswich, with the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data revealing nearly 20,000 new positions have been created across the Ipswich region in the last 2½ years. The labour force figures released this month reveal that since the Albanese Labor government came in we've increased jobs in our region by 10.5 per cent, bringing local employment to 204,000 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of major employers and developers in the Ipswich region have helped create this jobs boom, including the new Suntory drinks manufacturing facility at Swanbank; the Australia Post, Coles and L'Oreal distribution centres; and Rheinmetall's Military Vehicle Centre of Excellence in Redbank. Rheinmetall is supporting around 600 direct local jobs and hundreds of indirect jobs as part of a major contract for Defence delivered by the Albanese Labor government to produce and export Boxer Heavy Weapon Carrier vehicles to Germany. On top of this, JBS is putting on more than 500 new jobs and another shift from last year at their Dinmore meat processing plant in Ipswich in response to increased global demand for Aussie beef. This is good for jobs in the Ipswich region, and it's what a Labor government does for the people of Ipswich.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  Housing is vital for us to maintain a strong and vibrant economy and society. But, in my electorate of Warringah, it still remains an ongoing and pressing issue, as it is in many other places around the country. In our basic hierarchies of need, safety is paramount. Feeling safe means we have systems to support us and to ensure the safety of our families and loved ones, and this has to start with secure and affordable housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has a housing survey open to better understand the views of Warringah on the measures that could play a key role in addressing housing supply and demand, so I encourage everyone across Warringah to have their say before the survey closes. So far, we've heard from many different people in the community who've been locked out of buying a home and who are struggling to afford rent. These are the people who deliver our essential services, young families and our renting retirees. We've heard from local business who rely on workers on visas and who cannot get housing for their employees close to their work. So the problem is widespread.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In areas like North Sydney and Crows Nest, they are looking to build more than 7,000 residences over the next five years, which will provide some critical access to Sydney Metro. But we need to do more than just focus on construction to increase supply. We know that you also have to do much more around the better utilisation of the current housing stock that we have. So I call on the government to commit to meaningful reform when it comes to tax and utilisation to make sure we increase supply through all means.</span>

These clinics are revolutionising bulk-billing in the suburbs. They're fully bulk-billed. The wait times are low, and the opening hours are long. In breaking news, the Top Ryde Medicare urgent care clinic is now open for two hours longer, from 8 am to 10 pm, seven days a week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look, you'll hear us all bang on about this in this place, but don't take my word for it. Here's what locals are saying about the Top Ryde Medicare urgent care clinic. Yvonne said: 'The doctors and staff here are the best I've ever had. I recently attended, and I'm impressed with their protocol and their teamwork. It gave me great confidence in their handling. I'm forever grateful for their support.' Carrie said: 'Dear Jerome, we just had our first experience with urgent care at Top Ryde. I'm very pleased to say we were seen very quickly and were bulk-billed for the care. We definitely would have gone to the emergency department if we didn't know about it.' And Sigret said: 'Clap emoji, clap emoji, heart emoji, heart emoji. Such a luxury.' I don't really know what it means, Deputy Speaker Young, but you get the drift.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In less than a year, the urgent care clinic in Bennelong has become a crucial part of our local healthcare network. It's open from 8 am to 10 pm, and it's fully bulk-billed. We know that they are under risk under a Liberal government. Only Labor will protect our urgent care clinic and continue to strengthen Medicare in Bennelong.</span>

I ask you now: are you actually better off three years on? All I've seen is crisis after crisis after crisis—a cost-of-living crisis, a housing crisis and an energy bill crisis.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I speak to my charity groups, my food bank people are saying that the people that are arriving today looking for charity have shifted. They're not people that are unemployed. They're not the people they would traditionally be—those who have fallen on hard time. The people now showing up at food banks in my electorate include mums and dads, both working, who under this government just cannot make ends meet. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the housing crisis, when we left office there was no housing crisis. Two hundred and fifty thousand houses were being built each year. When you adjust the immigration policy to bring in 1.2 million in two years and you don't have anywhere for them to sleep, you create the housing crisis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the energy crisis. On my farms alone, when we were in government, my bills were around $1,200. Now they're over double that. We were told that energy was going to be free, from the wind and the sun. With 27,000 business insolvencies, Australia cannot afford any more crises. Australia cannot afford the ALP. </span>

Ron was a stalwart of the Southern Districts Soccer Football Association for decades. Indeed, he was on the committee for 26 years.

In addition to his service with Southern Districts, Ron was involved with the Liverpool Rangers Soccer Club for over 27 years. Throughout all of his life of volunteering, Ron worked passionately and tirelessly to make football more inclusive. Ron's service and dedication to football was recognised through life membership of the Southern Districts in 1993 and Liverpool Rangers in 2000. In 2012, he was also awarded football's prestigious George Churchward Medal.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  The coalition supports affordable and accessible health care for all Australian women. The government's announcement of $573 million in a women's health package is a welcome commitment, but let us not forget that the coalition has pioneered much of this work already. It was the former coalition government that made historic investments in women's health, establishing Australia's first endometriosis-specific clinics and laying the foundation for better health care for women nationwide. You see, women's health care has always been a priority for the coalition. As a father of three girls, I understand that any commitment to women's health is crucial. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But right now, across our nation, we have a primary health crisis that has never been worse. Under the Albanese Labor government, it has been harder and more expensive for women to access critical primary health care. The GP bulk-billing rate has collapsed from 88 per cent under the coalition to just 77 per cent today, leading to over 1.5 million Australians avoiding GP visits due to cost concerns. We will hear a 'Mediscare' campaign at the next election, but the coalition is the only party that can be trusted to get Australia's healthcare system back on track. </span>

This year, the title went to my good mate Liam Woods. Liam is truly inspiring. He's a strong supporter of the Leukaemia Foundation, Stem Cell Donors Australia and Transplant Australia and has helped others by sharing stories and the experience of his own transplant journey and raising vital funds for these important organisations. He has also proved that having a transplant or a negative diagnosis doesn't hold you back in life, representing our country on the world stage at the World Transplant Games and the Transplant Football World Cup. </span>

The Junior Citizen of the Year was Cessnock High School Interact. The Maree Callaghan Award for Young Female Achiever went to Lilly Bridge. The Sports Award went to young motocross superstar Braxsen Anderson. Community Event of the Year was once again awarded to the Kearsley Community Anzac Dawn Service, which is always a moving and appropriate way to remember those who served our nation. Finally, Tahni Beckett, John Bosco, Georgina Grine, Ron Pyne, Barbara Rodham, Bruce Wilson and the Huntlee Academy all received community awards. Congratulations to Liam. It was well deserved. Congratulations to everyone. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

She spoke with Australian nuclear specialists in nuclear law and nuclear engineering—Lenka Kolla; Adi Patterson; Robert Barr; Helen Cook; Kirsty Braybon; Jasmin Diab; and Will Shackel, the prolific teenager who set up Nuclear for Australia. People are hungry for cheap, reliable and clean power, and nuclear delivers that. All those stereotypes about people being afraid of nuclear—once it's explained to them, they are very keen to know more and look forward to Australia embracing it. I'd like to thank Grace so much for taking time out. Americans don't get many holidays, and it probably means she used up all her annual leave to come and educate us about the massive expansion, the safety and the reliability of nuclear power.</span>

I was pleased, with Deputy Mayor Nicole Jonic, assistant minister Senator Anthony Chisholm and local councillor Andrew Antoniolli, to be there when we announced this funding under the Australian government's urban Precincts and Partnerships Program. The project will develop designs for the expansion of the Ipswich Art Gallery and the redevelopment of the Ipswich Civic Centre, which was opened in the days of Gough Whitlam and Bill Hagan and upgraded by the governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. This will involve planning for a streetscape refresh of Brisbane Street, the integration of the Ipswich Inner CBD Cycle Network and additional urban green initiatives. The planning precinct aims to enhance economic development, and it will create jobs. It will also support our flourishing arts community in Ipswich and the new, better use of the Ipswich CBD. It will deliver an arts and culture precinct and provide a space for artists and performers to collectively work and create, and that's great for Ipswich. I'm pleased to support this, and I congratulate the Ipswich City Council on getting this funding.</span>

So, for all those who aren't doing the Port Fairy marathon, make sure you get down to Lady Bay at 10 o'clock on Sunday for a wonderful, wonderful cause. The Gillin Boys Foundation—started by Chris and Aaron and now led by Chris; sadly, Aaron passed away in 2017 from muscular dystrophy—is all about raising awareness for muscular dystrophy. It is a wonderful cause. I say to Chris, you are an absolute inspiration in the way that you have kept the Gillin Boys Foundation going, raising much-needed funds and awareness. Over $500,000 has now been raised to go to institutions like the Murdoch Children's Research Institute to do much-needed research. I can't be there because I'll be running the Port Fairy marathon, but I wish you all the best, Chris. I encourage everyone who can to please get down there and support. I still have my green laces. Get green laces on and make sure you're there doing everything you can to raise awareness and funds for muscular dystrophy. Well done, Chris.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  With the ever-increasing pressures on the cost of living, the urgent need for both parents to actively earn income has never been greater. While those across the floor may congratulate themselves on the reforms to reduce the cost of child care, the prevailing issue in my region is actually finding a placement. It's hard to save money on a service that you don't actually have the ability to access. There are waiting lists in some areas of upwards of 300 families. We have more young families in Cowper than ever before, which is fantastic to see, but the number of childcare placements has stagnated. A parent who is willing to work simply isn't able to do so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past six years, I've held childcare forums across my electorate and heard of the unworkable levels of red tape, of staff educational requirements that do not fit the level of pay and of poaching of current educators by primary schools and even the NDIS due to better conditions. That all leads to the demoralisation of the current workforce and the inability to attract new staff. My question to this government is: you must be hearing the same issues, so what system overhauls have you attempted to table over the past three years? I can tell my constituents in Cowper: none.</span>

I've been delighted to attend a number of events around Darwin and Palmerston in the last couple of weeks to celebrate the lunar new year. There have been events held by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of the Northern Territory. The NT Timor Chinese Association held a great celebration, and, on Australia Day, the Australia China Friendship Society NT ran an excellent event. I want to give a shout-out to these fantastic organisations for hosting these great events. Still to come are the Chung Wah Society's dinner and the Vietnamese Community in Australia NT Chapter's events. I'm very much looking forward to those.</span>

My electorate, Darwin and Palmerston, is very much known for its rich multicultural community, with diasporas from around the world in Darwin—something that I'm very proud of as the member for Solomon. I will always support these organisations. I love the fact that they run events that celebrate Australia but still hold to the traditions of the lunar new year that their families have been marking for generations.</span>

Across my electorate, we've got many of the foundation's campuses. Tomorrow, on the Senate lawn, Clontarf will be putting on a game of football—rugby league—and I'm looking forward to being part of that. Later in the week, there will be a presentation in the House from Clontarf as well. Because of Clontarf, hundreds of young men have graduated from high school and gone on to further education, employment, the military and a whole range of other things. The Aboriginal people in my electorate are working hard, and Clontarf has the next generation of leaders coming through.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  The Albanese Labor government has announced that 41 organisations across Australia will receive a share of $100 million for new crisis and transitional housing for women and children impacted by domestic and family violence and older women at risk of homelessness. Thanks to the Crisis and Transitional Accommodation Program, a local service provider in Ipswich, the Domestic Violence Action Centre—known as DVAC—which is the biggest and most important domestic violence crisis organisation west of Brisbane, will be funded $2.8 million to help build 10 new dwellings in the Ipswich region for women and children experiencing family and domestic violence and older women at risk of homelessness. This is funded through Labor's Housing Australia Future Fund—opposed by those opposite. The Crisis and Transitional Accommodation Program supports the building, remodelling and purchasing of new or expanded crisis and transitional accommodation. This will help thousands of women and children across Australia.</span>

The service provides support for women and children, particularly from a feminist point of view, and I have dealt with them for many years. I dealt with them prior to coming to this place when I was a practising family lawyer. Congratulations, DVAC, for the work you do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I rise to speak this afternoon about the direct impact of bureaucratic failures and an inadequate aged-care workforce on people in acute need of help and support in my electorate of Mallee. I refer to a constituent named Liz who came to me distressed by the red tape and inaction she had encountered regarding access to aged-care services. Liz is an older Australian living at home and has stage 4 metastatic lung cancer. In her words: 'I am bedridden. Surely I am a priority.' When I contacted Centrelink, I found her case had been waiting for more than 309 days. I called Minister Wells to discuss Liz's very acute need for increased support and subsequently worked with staff at the department. She is now receiving the care she needs and can safely remain at home with appropriate support. Bedridden elderly Australians should not have to fight the system to get the help they need to stay at home. Bloated bureaucracy and inaction on aged-care workforce shortages in the regions are an ongoing failure of this government.</span>

It is home to nationalities from all over the world and is home to all faiths. My diary reflects this diversity. In January this year, I attended a Serbian event and an Assyrian event as well as one organised by the Chinese Associations of Greater Western Sydney. In February, I attended multiple lunar new year celebrations hosted by the Australian Chinese Buddhist associations. Attending these events, affirming the communities they represent and thanking the community leaders, who give up so much of their time, is one of the great privileges of my job.</span>

Finally, there's James Chan OAM. James's efforts in the Chinese and Buddhist communities are legendary in our part of the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I rise to recognise the extraordinary act of bravery of young Deon Whitford, a 20-year-old proud Indigenous man who is a true hero in our community. Last Sunday, Deon was sitting in his ute in a car park at Cairns when a young lad, frantic and distressed, knocked on his window. The boy pleaded for help, screaming that two young girls were caught in the raging floodwaters in a nearby drain. Without a moment of hesitation, Deon raced alongside the drain as the terrified children were swept away in a powerful current. The drain went underneath the car park, a very deadly hazard, 250 metres downstream. One of the kids was able to get out. The second one disappeared into the drain. Deon, without a second thought, sprinted to the other side. He leapt into the fast-moving water, reached out and pulled her to safety. His first priority was not himself but ensuring that these kids were safe. Emergency services arrived quickly after and assessed the child, who, thankfully, was not injured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deon didn't seek any recognition. He simply did what he knew was right. He's been rightfully nominated by the council for a national bravery award. It's not just about award nomination; it's recognition of selflessness, courage and community spirit. It's a reminder that true heroes walk amongst us, ready to act in a moment of crisis. Today we honour Deon Whitford, a man whose bravery saved a life and whose actions reflect the best of our nation.</span>

I was pleased and proud to have spoken at his eulogy at his funeral. I want to pay my deepest condolences to his wife Jan and his daughter Leanne. Norm was a wonderful servant of the Labor Party. He was a member of the party for 66 years and the first person I voted for as a councillor in the Ipswich City Council. He lived around the corner from Des Freeman, who became the mayor in 1979. Norm was the youngest councillor in Queensland in the Pine Rivers area and then moved with his job as corrective services to Ipswich. He then was actively involved in Ipswich politics, particularly in the local Labor Party. He was a councillor for division 4.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a brilliant orator and raconteur who was quite dapper. He liked the grey suits and the floral ties in the likes of Al Grassby and Paul Keating. He was a fantastic local councillor. He was more like a pastor and priest and a person like that. He was there to help people. In his retirement days, I used to call him the mayor of Marburg. I enjoyed catching up with him, and he would speak to you as loudly one on one as you would speak to a whole group of people. I raise my voice in deliberate honour of Norm. The outpouring of love, respect and admiration for Norm across the Ipswich community is there for all to see. He left us with beautiful memories. Thank you, Norm.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  Australia can't afford another three years of hard Labor. I'm worried that our country is heading in the wrong direction, with families struggling under Labor's cost-of-living crisis. I've watched as Labor and the Greens have attacked our community with bans on the timber industry and cuts to regional programs. I will always work to protect our local jobs, reduce waste in government and deliver lower taxes so that we can take the pressure off families and afford the things that really matter, like better roads, improved health care and upgrading our local facilities. We need a fair share of funding for Gippsland. We need to get Australia back on track.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to update the chamber on the Cycling Without Age Gippsland program, which has received great support since we started fundraising only a matter of six months ago. As the honorary chair of the program, I have been able to work with the community to raise enough money to purchase two trishaws and a trailer, and we've started giving our first rides in our community for people who can no longer ride a bicycle for themselves. At its heart, Cycling Without Age, across Australia, is about generosity and kindness. It's about giving people the opportunity to socialise. I want to give a huge thanks to the volunteer pilots right across Australia who are giving their time every week to put smiles on faces. Personally, I've had the chance to volunteer to take several rides along the foreshore at Lakes Entrance. It's been an extraordinary privilege to hear people's stories. I look forward to spreading Cycling Without Age Gippsland right across the region in the weeks ahead.</span>

Over the weekend, for the first time, I attended the Vietnamese Tet festival at Fairfield Showground. The Tet festival coincides with the Vietnamese festival of the new year, which this year is the Year of the Snake. The festival was a huge success, with dozens of stallholders, rides and food stalls. The crowd was terrific and a perfect blend of old and young, traditional dress with modern.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The feel of the event was one of celebration and joy, even though it was very warm in the morning and got wet later. This was especially evident on the stage, which was full of singing and colourful, beautiful costumes. In the evening, I was pleased to join my parliamentary colleagues: the member for McMahon, Chris Bowen; the member for Cabramatta, Tri Vo; the member for Liverpool, Charishma Kaliyanda; and the member for Prospect, Hugh McDermott. The Prime Minister—no stranger to our part of Sydney—was also present for the evening and was warmly received by the crowd. I congratulate the organisers of the event, especially Peter Ha. While it may have been my first Tet festival, it certainly won't be my last. I wish all the constituents from the Vietnamese community a happy and prosperous Year of the Snake.</span>

The City of Joondalup will receive approximately $7.2 million whilst the City of Stirling will receive $9.3 million. This represents increases of one per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively, over the 2023-24 grants.</span>

Both components of the grants are untied in the hands of local government, allowing councils to spend the grants according to local priorities. These federal grants help subsidise the cost to ratepayers of providing essential community services and maintaining the local road network.</span>

The petroleum exploration permit known as PEP-11 has been formally rejected, putting an end to the decade-long threat of oil and gas off our precious coast.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 75,000 people signed petitions to stop PEP-11, so, when Labor's Minister for Industry and Science formally rejected the applications, there was a huge collective sigh of relief. PEP-11 has no friends in Newcastle. Our community's message has been loud, clear and consistent for over a decade: PEP-11 is not welcome—not in Sydney, not on the Central Coast and certainly not in Newcastle. This project never made sense—economically, environmentally or from an energy standpoint. It endangered local jobs in tourism, hospitality and fishing. This could have been resolved years ago had the former Liberal government followed due process. I'm pleased that the Albanese Labor government worked methodically to reach this decision.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Newcastle community for its patience and advocacy. In particular, I'd like to give a big shout-out to Natasha Dean and the fabulous Save Our Coast team and acknowledge the tireless efforts of Josh Kirkman and the Surf Riders Foundation for leading the community fight against PEP-11. I'm honoured to have taken up this fight on your behalf. The minister's rejection of PEP-11 is a huge win, and I thank Novocastrians for their strong and steadfast advocacy. This is your win. </span>

To Joanne Doyle, you're next off the order. You've done such a great job, and you've done it in a term when you've lost two parents. I don't know how you've done it. I really appreciate you, Jo, for everything you do for my community.</span>

Keely Berther, you're amazing. The energy you bring to my office is absolutely fantastic. Rose and Matthew, you're both an absolute breath of fresh air. I have so many volunteers in that office. I'll name as many as I can. There's Peter, Steve, Sheldon, Nathan, Susan, Jeff, Neil, Sam, Adam—and there are so many more. We are a service provider to our community. What you guys do makes our community better, and I want everyone to hear how much I appreciate you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I've been working with the Belgrave Football Netball Club, the Belgrave Cricket Club, the Belgrave Junior Football Club and the Belgrave Men's Shed to upgrade the pavilion at the Belgrave Recreation Reserve. The Belgrave Recreation Reserve pavilion was built in 1950 and doesn't have facilities that allow our community to come together. While the women's teams are growing, the outdated facilities are holding them back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been out to the club and seen firsthand the sense of community it provides for all who are part of the Belgrave family. There's been strong community support for an upgraded pavilion at the reserve that doubles as a community hub for the hills in the event of an emergency. We have now received over 1,070 signatures on our petition. Thank you to the committees of the Belgrave clubs and the Men's Shed for your continued advocacy for the upgrade. I particularly want to thank Mel Davey. Mel's passion for women's sport is unparallelled, and she has been an incredible advocate for upgrading the facilities for all in Belgrave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time that the Belgrave Recreational Reserve pavilion was upgraded to support the growth in female participation and become a community hub for the wider Hills region. And I will continue to be a strong local voice for this upgrade, and together we'll keep fighting to get it done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I rise today to make sure the community knows about a really important announcement that the Leader of the Opposition and I made last Thursday—that is, if a coalition government is elected, we will rescind the offshore wind farm that is proposed off the coast of Warrnambool and Port Fairy. The community consultation by Chris Bowen and Anthony Albanese has been an absolute debacle for this offshore wind farm. They haven't had a clue from day one. First, it would be off the coast of Portland; then, they moved it off the coast of Port Fairy and Warrnambool. No environmental work has been done. No economic impact analysis has been done. No assurances have been given about using any local content. From woe to go, the whole debacle has been a complete and utter sham. The community feels like it has been utterly walked over through this process. Remember, when it comes to renewable energy, no electorate is doing more, especially when it comes to wind, than the electorate of Wannon. So the community has said 'Enough is enough!' to the government. That is why, if a coalition government is elected, we will not proceed with that offshore wind farm.</span>

These last three years have seen the worst inflation in more than three decades. Grocery prices are up 30 per cent on 2020 levels. Housing is less affordable than ever before. Rentals are in critically short supply. Two in three Australian households have had to cut back on cooling or heating their homes. One in three households have had to cut back on kids sport or on school excursions. Many are unable to insure their homes or their farms.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need all politicians in this country to listen to their communities and work together to give them confidence and hope for the future. This has to include a vision for sensitive, evidence based tax reform to address increasing intergenerational inequity. That's something that, as yet, we have not received from any of the major parties in this country. We need a vision on getting a fair return on our fossil fuel and mineral wealth, and we have to use that to make best-practice health, dental, disability and aged-care services accessible to all. We need a vision for making affordable housing a reality for all Australians. We need a vision to make things better, not worse, for the next generation. It has been my greatest privilege to be the member for Kooyong in this term, and, if re-elected, I commit to that vision.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is especially the case in regional and rural Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, as you know, if you cannot control inflation and the costs of business, the pressure that's going to be put on child care providers is enormous. What this government has failed to understand is that if you do not address the cost of doing business then you make life incredibly hard for businesses, including small businesses—and the majority of those who provide childcare services are small businesses. On top of that, if you do not have policies which enable you to expand the number of places by ensuring that you are bringing on board people who will work in child care—those wonderful educators who provide that education and care to young people—then you will see childcare deserts created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that the government should be doing, and should be doing immediately, is saying: 'Right, our first priority should be those areas where there are childcare deserts. That is what we should be aiming to fix.' Yet what we've seen from this government is an inner-city focus which has been all about addressing where they perceive concerns in the inner city. They haven't been able to look beyond the inner city to say: 'Okay, what are the policies? What do we need in regional and rural Australia in particular?' That is especially the case in my electorate of Wannon. What have they been able to do, especially in areas like Casterton, Portland and Warrnambool, to address the issue of workforce shortages and make sure that there are additional centres, because additional centres are needed but additional centres can't open up unless you can get the workforce that is required? Yet we haven't seen anything addressing those issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Moncrieff, Angie Bell, for coming down to Wannon very early in this term, having identified that this is a real issue in rural and regional areas, particularly in my electorate of Wannon, and for agreeing to come back in the not-too-distant future to once again sit down and hear what is going on on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is by making sure you're out there listening, speaking to families and understanding their needs and concerns that you understand how, especially when it comes to mothers, they're not able to get back into the workforce because they can't get childcare places. All those concerns are real concerns. It's so important to make sure that you get the policy settings right to address those issues so that you get sustainable settings for child care. If we continue to see the cost rises and cost increases that we're seeing under this Labor government, child care is going to become more and more unaffordable for Australian families. That's not what we want. Particularly in regional and rural areas, like in the seat of Wannon, we have to make sure that availability is there, especially in those regions and areas that need it the most. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  Labor has always been the party of fairness, families and working people. In less than three years in government, the Albanese government has put forward transformative policies to build a universal early childhood education system accessible to all families. We had no choice. In the last four years of the former coalition government, childcare prices went up by 49 per cent, twice as much as the OECD average. Why was this the case?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not enough to say those opposite are poor economic managers. They like to tout themselves as great economic managers, but the statistics tell a different story. But it's not just that; the mismanagement and neglect by those opposite of the early childhood system and of families more broadly go far beyond this. Those opposite have had an insidious contempt for fairness and inclusion, and that has played out in the early childhood education sector. Those opposite to me have not put forward one cost-of-living policy in their time in opposition. I'd like to hear just one cost-of-living measure. Those opposite to me do not advocate for families, for equal opportunities and choices for women or for an equitable and open educational system that gives every single child the same start in life. They never have. I doubt they ever will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Labor government are building Australia's future when it comes to our policies on early education. There is the three-day guarantee. We want to make sure every child gets the best possible start in life. That's why we've introduced the three-day guarantee for all families. This is to guarantee all families three days of childcare subsidy each fortnight, with 100 hours guaranteed for families caring for First Nations children and families who work, study or train. Over 100,000 families across this country will be eligible for more subsidised hours of early education. That is at least 100,000 children or more—probably a lot more, because it is 100,000 families—who will access the transformative benefits of early learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just think for a moment about the ripple effect of this. Just one child in my electorate of Wills has the potential to make a difference to the lives of those in their community, to the entire country. Each of these people has the potential to contribute positively to the world around them. Times that by over 100,000 and that's the ripple effect you will see. Early education matters—it makes a difference—and it's just another step in Labor's plan to build a universal early education system and save an average family around $1,370 in the first financial year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the former coalition government delivered their 2018 childcare package, they halved the number of subsidised hours of care that low-income families could access. They halved it, from 48 hours to 24. I don't think you can change those facts. They know they did that. The number of low-income families accessing care went from 32,000 to 6½ thousand. This was no accidental policy; it was built on the ideology of those opposite to increase inequity and exclude communities of people from accessing education and care. They don't rate it; they don't believe in it; therefore, they didn't do anything about it. They might jump up and down in these types of motions and play the opposition card, but when they were in government they halved it. Under this government, through the cheaper childcare policy, we have increased the subsidy, meaning a family earning $120,000 with one child in care three days a week saved $2,140 last financial year. That is thousands of dollars back in the pockets of families, mums and dads, to help provide them cost-of-living relief so they can invest in their children's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that child care means investing in and respecting the crucial work of early childhood educators. That is why the Albanese Labor government announced a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood education workers, investing $3.6 billion to make that happen. That means a lot for those early educators who are committed to the kids in their care and their education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It might be a cliche, but it really does take a village to raise a child. It also takes a lot of transformative policies across child care, early education, families and health. It takes a commitment and a deep respect for equity and fairness, for education is what gives us that start in life, and that's what this Labor government is all about.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  Before I get into child care, and before the member for Wills leaves, I will take his challenge on. Divestiture of supermarkets, the toughest possible way to hold the supermarkets—the big two—to account would bring prices down for families that are struggling with their childcare bills, and those opposite voted against it. There's the answer to the member for Wills' policy on the cost of living—feel free to follow up with a prime minister. With the Prime Minister, we get a wet lettuce—a mandatory code when the voluntary code is not working. He brags about it and it doesn't come into effect until 1 April 2025. Only in the Prime Minister's world can he take credit for a cost-of-living measure that hasn't even come into effect yet. I'll move on, but I wanted to treat the member for Wills with respect and answer his question about the coalition's cost-of-living initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does link to child care, because families are struggling at so many levels. They are struggling to pay for groceries, they are struggling to pay for mortgages, for rents, for petrol—everything is going up. They are also struggling to pay for their childcare bills, which is why it is a real slap in the face to working families in Casey when the government continue to talk about the supposed savings that have happened under this government when the reality is completely different. As the member for Moncrieff has outlined in her motion, in the three years since the government was elected, the cost of child care has increased by 22.3 per cent. Since the government introduced their so-called cheaper child care policy, out-of-pocket costs for families have skyrocketed by 12.7 per cent. Almost 30 per cent of childcare services are charging over the hourly rate cap under the current government. Under the previous government, it was at 21 per cent. One of the reasons for that is, when you invest taxpayer money into subsidies without investing money into increasing the supply, you are going to drive prices up. It's economics 101, which we know is not this government's or the Prime Minister's strong suit. More supply with the same amount of demand will bring prices down, but the government has not focused on increasing supply of child care at all through this term of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very lucky in my community to have a wonderful group called Mums of the Hills, led by Belinda Young, who does a lot of strong work advocating for many issues, particularly in the Dandenong Ranges and the Yarra Valley, including access to child care. Last year I was able to take the member for Moncrieff, Angie Bell, the shadow minister for child care, to meet with Belinda and speak to mums that are impacted. I will share some of Belinda's analysis of the local childcare landscape and the childcare desert that we have that this government has not addressed in the last three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Data from 2024 continues to show that parents in the Yarra Ranges struggle to secure spots for their children. The situation is particularly severe in some suburbs, where ratios range from 10 to 50-plus children per place, making it nearly impossible for working families to access early childhood education and care. Many residents in my community have to travel outside of our community for work. The average commuting distance is 28 kilometres, and this is significantly higher than the Victorian average of 16.7 kilometres. So, for these families, access to long day care hours is essential to account for the commute time. There's limited access to this long day care. It's leaving families without adequate care for their children, leaving parents making typical compromises between career advancement and the family obligations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to data from the Mitchell Institute, in Coldstream there has been an improvement locally in childcare availability, but, even with that improvement, there are nine children for every one long day care place available. In Silvan, in Monbulk, in Sassafras, in Wandin and in Seville, the ratios are ranging from 10 to 50-plus children per childcare place. In Ferny Creek, there are three to seven children per childcare place and seven to eight children per long day care place. In Olinda, there are two to five children per childcare place and eight to 30 per long day care place. But we haven't seen any focus on increasing places from this government. Two and a half or three years in, prices are up over 22.3 per cent under the Albanese Labor government. Imagine the damage they will do to child care in another three years if they get into government.</span>

That's why we're committed to making sure every family, no matter their circumstances, can access quality care. We understand that every child deserves access to quality early education because it's good for kids, it's good for families and it's good for the economy. That's why we fought to make child care more affordable, more accessible and fairer across the country. Our Labor policies have benefited 9,000 families in Bennelong. Since coming to government, we've cut the costs of early learning by over 17 per cent, putting money back into the pockets of families during the current cost-of-living challenges. An Australian family on an income of $120,000 a year paying the average quarterly fee for 30 hours of child care per week is approximately $2,768 better off since September 2023. That's money for groceries, rent or savings, and that's real cost-of-living support for local families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare that approach to that of the former government. Under their government, they neglected the value of affordable child care, with families watching costs skyrocket by 49 per cent—twice as much as the OECD average. They refused to act and left families to struggle while they stood by. That has changed under our government. We appointed the ACCC and the Productivity Commission to each review the early education sector, ensuring consistent reflection and progressive development towards early learning. Our government puts the needs of our communities first and is focused on how best to improve them. Our goal is to have a truly universal, affordable and accessible early education system for every Australian child. But we will not get there without the incredible educators who show up every day to support our kids. For too long, those workers were undervalued and underpaid. To right those wrongs, Labor delivered a historic 15 per cent wage increase over two years to retain the current workforce and to attract new workers to the sector. The universal system, which is our own, will need a well-paid, well-skilled and well-staffed workforce. Our 15 per cent wage rise will mean, on average, a full-time early childhood educator who is paid at the award rate will receive a pay increase of at least $103 per week, increasing to at least $155 per week from December 2025. Already, these wage rises are attracting new workers to the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For educators, these reforms will mean better wages, greater job security and the ability to focus on what they do best—supporting young kids in their early years. For families, more affordable early learning means less financial stress and greater flexibility to work, study or balance other responsibilities. And we're not stopping there. From 2026, we'll replace the outdated activity test with our three-day guarantee, giving children of 66,700 families across the country access to three days guaranteed subsidised early childhood education per fortnight without forcing parents into unnecessary trade-offs. That will save these families an average of $1,370 a year. And, for First Nations families, we're making sure children can access 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We just heard the member for Casey talk about childcare deserts. He'd be pleased to know that an Albanese government will continue to expand our policies in early education through the $1 billion Building Early Education Fund, ensuring families can access quality early learning in outer suburbs and regional communities, by building childcare centres in these early education deserts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the approach is very different. While we've been advocating for and actually doing stuff about affordable early education, the Liberals and Nationals continue to shun evidence based reforms that put Australian families first. We had a Liberal senator in the other place making ludicrous claims that 'early education destroys the family unit' or that early educators 'infect children with a woke mind virus'. This is just crazy stuff—views that are held by members of the Liberal Party. It's absurd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only an Albanese Labor government will keep delivering cheaper child care, better wages for educators and a future where every child gets the best start in life.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that we humans cannot live without is food, and it is because of one dedicated group of people that we can source food in this country: our farmers. Every time we sit down for a meal, we should be grateful for the tireless work of Aussie farmers. Our farmers deserve more than just words. They deserve a government that delivers real action, not just politicians donning an akubra or a puffer vest for a photo op. Playing dress-ups does nothing to truly support those who feed our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last term, this government has been steadfast in its commitment to Australian farmers, working to grow our nearly $1 billion agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries, and the results are clear. Since July 2022, we have achieved 169 market access wins, including opening 22 new markets, implementing 66 improvements to reduce export costs and requirements, securing 72 achievements to maintain access despite trade threats, and restoring nine previously lost trade opportunities. These numbers tell a powerful story: progress, investment and opportunity for Australian farmers and producers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A thriving agriculture sector requires protection. That's why our government has invested over $1 billion to ensure that Australia's biosecurity system remains world class. We saw the importance of these investments firsthand with the outbreak of avian influenza last year. Thanks to our robust biosecurity measures, Australia remains the only continent free from the devastating avian influenza. But we are not complacent. We are stepping up our national preparedness to safeguard our industries from future threats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong agriculture sector needs a strong workforce. Under the previous government, the agriculture workforce was in crisis. The previous government ignored the warning signs, leaving us to clean up the mess. We took immediate action, establishing the tripartite Agricultural Workforce Working Group; creating the agriculture labour taskforce; and strengthening the PALM scheme, growing participation from 8,000 workers in March 2020 to over 27,000 by the end of 2024. Without a skilled and reliable workforce, the entire agriculture sector suffers. That's why we continue to invest in training, TAFE and job opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we cannot ignore the challenges posed by climate change. Droughts are becoming more frequent and severe, yet the previous government chose to ignore these challenges, leading to reduced farm profitability. We take a different approach. We delivered the first ever joint agriculture ministers statement on climate change. We developed the first Agriculture and Land Sectoral Plan to help the industry reach net zero by 2050. We invested $1.1 billion into the Natural Heritage Trust, including $302.1 million for climate-smart agricultural programs. We committed $519.1 million over the next four years from the Future Drought Fund to enhance climate resilience. These actions are not just about today. We are about securing the future for Australia's agricultural sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's agriculture exports are at record highs thanks to our government's work in opening new markets and restoring key trade relations. We export over 70 per cent of our agricultural, fishery and forestry products to 169 global markets, the most diversified trade portfolio in history. We're restoring trade relations with China, leading to the removal of $20 billion in trade barriers. We're ensuring Australian live rock lobsters return to the Chinese dining table. We supported record red meat exports and a booming aquaculture industry. Our government understands that strong trade means strong farmers and a strong economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To further strengthen the sector, we're re-investing $500 million from the National Reconstruction Fund for agriculture, forestry, fishery, food and fibre. We're also tackling workforce shortages head-on by facilitating over 22,100 enrolments in agriculture related fee-free TAFE courses from January 2023 to September 2024, by strengthening the PALM scheme and increasing its workforce and by allocating $1.9 million to attract Australians to the workforce. This government is taking action and supporting the agricultural sector. We need to stick with a government that does that, and that's what the Labor government is here to do. We support farmers, we support workers and we support our food, fibre and forestry industries.</span>

She is co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Soil. I acknowledge her work, and I acknowledge her experience in that regard. But, sadly, the Labor government took away the position of Soils Advocate in August 2023. Penny Wensley was doing a great job, and it's just one example of how Labor has let down our agriculture sector. It's no fault of the member for Paterson. I want to place that firmly on the record. She is a good advocate. But her colleagues and certainly the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—who knows who it was at the time—let the nation down.</span>

                  </a>  The member for Durack's right; it's not funny, but it 'notes that the government has been delivering for Australian farmers'. They're the first few words. The government has not been. Let's go through the long, sad, sorry list. We look at the biosecurity tax, where our farmers are expected to pay for the biosecurity of goods coming in from overseas, competing with their products on our shelves. We look at the truckies tax. That's an impost on our farmers. We look at the 450 gigalitres of Murray-Darling water being taken out of the system. One of the greatest food- and fibre-producing nations on Earth is now going to have to do it with 450 gigalitres less water.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just shameful. Where is that water going to go? It's going to go out the mouth of the Murray. It's not going to be used for food production. It's not going to be used to grow more fibre. When the member for Hunter said we should applaud our farmers, we should. The farmers will be okay in this instance, but it's what it does to the rest of those river communities that is bringing shame upon this government. It's the hairdresser. It's the cafe. It's the local mechanic. It's the local school. They all lose out because those communities get diminished.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the green tape and it's the red tape that this government is foisting upon our poor farmers. I see that I've got my Western Australian friend here, the member for Durack. They're banning live sheep exports. The trade has been going for decades. We've got the best animal welfare standards in the world, and it's now going to be filled by countries which do not give a jot about the sheep. They couldn't care less about the animal welfare standards. They will fill our trade. And what does Labor do? They put $107 million in last year's budget, the biggest item for agricultural spending, on an item to stop farmers from farming, shut down an industry that was viable and thumb their nose—to have us thumb our nose—in a diplomatic relations nightmare, at Middle Eastern countries which relied heavily on that trade. It'll be filled by cowboys. It just will be. And sheep will suffer. They will suffer. And they will suffer on the watch of this government. Our farmers won't be able to do what they've done successfully for decades, and the list goes on and on.</span>

They don't care about the ag visa over on that side, but they did make changes to the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme. They made changes to unionise the scheme. They made changes so that farmers are going to have to pay workers to sit on their backsides and do nothing, but that's the Labor way. They're always subservient to their union masters. They're always subservient to those people who send them here, and we know—</span>

But, thankfully, changes were made to the PALM scheme so that now the farmers are getting a better deal, and so are the Pacific workers who are coming here. They were losing out. They were losing out on those valuable remittances which they send back, which in some of those countries are more than half of their GDP. So it's now better for farmers and better for the workers. The only trouble is it runs out in July. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  I am absolutely delighted to second this motion on agriculture today. I just want to start out by saying thank you to members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture—the government, the opposition and some Independents—who have worked very well together to produce two really great reports in relation to agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">food story: feeding the nation and beyond</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>with apologies to Buzz Lightyear. It was an inquiry into food security. It took us over 12 months to complete this report, and it made 35 recommendations. Whilst we have an incredible agriculture sector here in Australia, food security is something that we need to turn our attention to. Despite being one of the most food-secure countries in the world, recent developments, both here and overseas, have shown us that food security presents real and growing challenges for our nation. We need to be focusing on that food security, and I again want to thank everyone who made a contribution to that report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of the recommendations in that report which I think are worth speaking about are that we need a food plan in Australia and we need to pay close attention to biosecurity, which our government is doing. We've in fact turned it around and protected our nation from things like lumpy skin disease, foot-and-mouth disease and avian flu. I know that biosecurity is at the top of the government's list when we think about agriculture because we have to protect our sector at all costs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the other recommendations that we made were having a food plan for Australia and also having a minister for food. We've also made a recommendation that we need to enforce the grocery code of conduct and make it mandatory. That is one of the recommendations that the government has put in place, and I am very pleased about that. So this report is a seminal text according to the industry, who backed it, and I again want to say that I do hope that we get to take more action on this report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other report that we managed to do in the ag committee this year was <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rading </span><span style="font-style:italic;">north</span>, and it came off the back of Sir Nicholas Moore's report, which said that we really needed to lean into our South-East Asian markets. Again, I am so delighted to be part of a government that has been able to open up trade again for our ag sector, getting us back into China and opening up the South-East Asian market. We are working incredibly hard on doing that—on ensuring that there are places for our agricultural products to be sold and that our farmers have access to them. It is just incredibly important in a world where trade is vital that we continue to forge ahead with getting our products to market, particularly in South-East Asia. I again commend Senator Farrell, the Minister for Trade and Tourism, who has done such a remarkable job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Julie Collins, who is working so tirelessly to develop the first Agriculture and Land Sectoral Plan to chart the path for the industry to actively contribute to net zero, investing $1.1 billion in the current round of the National Heritage Trust and also investing $68.3 million to support the sector to act on climate and reduce emissions. I know a lot of young farmers want to do this. They're leading the way. They're into regenerative agriculture. That is such an important part of not only building our ag sector but also making it sustainable for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I would really love to mention here is that Labor has been delivering for Australian farmers and producers by helping our nearly $100 billion agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector grow, and that is key. We need our ag sector to be growing. We recorded 169 market access achievements, and that is such a vital thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point that I want to make is that ag is an incredibly dynamic sector. We are attracting young people to it. It's very high tech these days. The level of skill that's needed in agriculture these days is second to none and constantly evolving. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't be prouder of being part of a government that is delivering for the ag sector and knows that we need to keep moving into the future to ensure that we do all have enough food and that we continue to feed the world as well. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  This motion moved by the member for Hunter would be comical but for the damage that this Labor government has done to the agriculture, fishing and forestry sector over the last two years and nine months. Now, that's not me saying that; that's the industry saying that. We are so lucky that the ag industry has been strong enough to weather this assault. It has been an all-out assault on those sectors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me start with a handful of policy changes they've made that have impacted on our farmers across the board. Firstly, they tore up the dedicated ag visa, which was the biggest structural reform to the ag workforce in our nation. I know. I have the PALM scheme, and we had the ag visa workers, in my electorate. Now we have problems with being able to pick the blueberries, the bananas and the avocados. They just don't understand the damage that they do, because they don't understand the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They attempted to slug farmers with a new $150 million biosecurity protection levy which would force farmers to pay for the biosecurity risks of international competitors. For those of you at home who might not have understood, our farmers are having to pay a biosecurity levy here for what people overseas are sending here. How is that fair? They're already paying over half a billion dollars in biosecurity anyway through other programs, and this is a cash grab by this government because it doesn't care about farmers. 'We're just going to reap the rewards. We'll just bring that money in on another $150 million biosecurity levy.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most disgusting things I've seen in this term is also the shutting down of the live sheep industry. They brought it forward. They had no consultation with the community. It's a $100 million industry, and they say: 'We've got $160 million to cover that. You'll be right. Go on and do something else. Find another industry.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are generational farmers, generational families who have had their legs cut out from underneath them because of ideology. We have the best animal practices in the world. </span>

                  </a>  I'll take the interjection from the member for McEwen, because the next thing I was going to talk about was a new truckie and ute tax on diesel vehicles. Hang on—what do you think the member for McEwen did between 1998 and 2002? Guess what he did. He sold truck parts for diesel trucks. The chameleon! Yet he is servicing his paymasters and putting a diesel tax—a carbon tax—on four-wheel-drives, mum-and-dad SUVs. You're going to see an increase of about $25,000 on one of the most popular vehicles, the Toyota Hi-Lux. </span>

                  </a>  It's not garbage, because I have spoken to the industry and they are telling me that every day of the week. They want us to unwind this because it is hurting them and it is hurting our farmers. Our farmers are the ones who drive the trucks, who freight all the food and fibre, but Labor wouldn't know anything about that. They just sit in their inner seats with their teal friends, making bad decisions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about pushing ahead with the water buybacks that ignore the economic and social safeguards for an additional 450 gigalitres? Where is that water going to go? Is it going to go on crops or in dams? No, it's going to go straight out to the ocean—wasted water—because they don't understand the industry.

These are policies which are just so out there. They don't care about the farmers; they don't care about you. Get rid of them at the next election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I thank the fine member for Hunter for moving this motion, because as regional members we know how important our farmers are to our regions, our country and the world. On Friday, I attended the Nowra Show. It's a show I've been attending for more than 50 years. I grew up on a dairy farm, and the show has always been a big part of my life. It has been 150 years since the first Nowra Show, and our farmers still come together to show their animals and produce, and provide demonstrations to keep the ag spirit alive. It's where dairy farmers, beef farmers, poultry and alpaca farmers, and timber, vegetable and crop growers enter their finest. It's where high school students enter cattle and take very seriously the growing of the biggest pumpkin. It ranges from horse events to the magnificent pavilion, where cakes, artwork and flowers are all carefully created and exhibited. It's where local community organisations, schools and businesses all come together, and it's where our kids gain an insight into our proud agricultural past and future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past couple of weeks I've also been to the Berry, Kiama and Eurobodalla agricultural shows, and I'm really looking forward to the Kangaroo Valley and Milton shows. My electorate of Gilmore is proud of its agricultural heritage, and there is nothing better than seeing our community come together and have such a good time. Food is essential, and we should never take for granted how important agriculture and farming is for the existence of our families, our communities, our country and the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After my own dairy-farming dad passed away when I was 21, I made a promise to myself that one day I would do something to help farmers like my dad. Today I stand in this Australian parliament, proud to say I am a member of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture, which has taken part in inquiries into growing Australian agriculture to $100 billion, feeding the nation and beyond. But it is since coming to government that we have made real strides to deliver for Aussie farmers and producers, helping our nearly $100 billion agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors continue to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really was a horror time under the Morrison Liberal government, when international relationships became fragmented and Australia's reputation suffered as a result. I'm pleased to say that, since coming to government, the Albanese Labor government has recorded 169 market access achievements since July 2022. This is so important because Australia exports over 70 per cent of our agricultural, fisheries and forestry produce to 169 markets globally. We have restored dialogue to Australia's relationship with China and secured the removal of $20 billion of trade impediments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dining tables in China will now feature live Australian rock lobsters—a win for our farmers and our exporters. We see similar stories right throughout the sector, from record red-meat exports to the booming aquaculture industry. We are committed to supporting our exporters to pursue opportunities in new markets, including through building stronger economic ties with India, negotiating a free trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates, supporting greater regional trade cooperation and maximising the gains from recent free trade agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were massive issues left over by the Liberals, who ignored workforce shortages in the agriculture industry for too long. The Liberals ripped away funding from TAFE. They created a massive visa backlog and eroded worker protections. They had an ag visa, then they didn't and then they did again. But it failed to deliver a single worker to Australian farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast, we have not wasted a second in cleaning up the mess of those opposite. We established the tripartite Agricultural Workforce Working Group and stood up the agriculture labour taskforce within the department. Our free TAFE is making a difference, with over 22,100 enrolments in agriculture-related free TAFE courses from January 2023 to September 2024. Under the Albanese Labor government, the Pacific and Australian Labour Mobility scheme—or PALM scheme, as it's known—has continued to grow from around 8,000 workers in March 2020 to over 27,000 at the end of November 2024. We've funded the continuation of the AgCAREERSTART gap-year employment program for an additional two years. Our government is continuing to invest in programs that support employment, support our farmers and keep Australian agriculture strong.</span>

                  <a href="286535" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I've always found the member for Hunter to be a very straight shooter. Unfortunately, on this one, he's missed the target by a long way. He's missed the target by an extremely long way. Let's have a look at what Labor has done. Labor has done nothing for the agricultural sector but tie it up in red tape and green tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at what else they've done, starting with the fishing industry and the ban on gillnets. The banning of gillnets put over 90 fishermen in my electorate of Dawson out of business. This wasn't done by any scientific means. This was political science. This was a sneaky little deal done by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to make UNESCO and the Greens—under the Labor-Green alliance—happy, all under the guise of saving the Great Barrier Reef. Newsflash—a gillnet doesn't go anywhere near the Great Barrier Reef. Can you imagine what a net would be like around coral? It's too silly for words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have they done with biosecurity? Labor is proposing to tax our farmers for the biosecurity risks of their overseas competitors. Nowhere else in the world does this, but this is what they're trying to do. It's absolutely ludicrous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The family car and ute tax is another assault on rural and regional Australia. When you're a farmer, you can't use an electric vehicle. They can't carry the weight, they can't tow the load and they can't cover the vast distances. There are not electric charging stations within close proximity to be used. Now the vehicles that we drive—like Hiluxes, Rangers, Patrols, LandCruisers and those sorts of things—are going up in cost by between $10,000 and $20,000, according to our car dealers, all to try to get people into this electric fantasy that simply won't work for rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest blights I've seen is the killing off of the live sheep trade. Make no mistake. We understand it's live sheep today and cattle tomorrow, all under the guise of keeping your little mates from the Greens happy, so you can roll over and get a little belly tickle from the Greens. We get it. We see it all the time. But I've been over and seen Western Australia and I've been on the live sheep boats. I've seen the ventilation that comes down and looks after the live sheep. I've seen the pens and how much room they have in there. I've seen firsthand that they have a vet on board and that all the people around the area are looking after the sheep. This is what they do. But no, what has Labor done to keep their Greens mates happy? They shut this industry down. These are multigenerational farms. I've spoken to farmers from WA who are the fourth and fifth generations—not for long!</span>

                  </a>  Value add? I tell you what, they're totally delusional. You need to get out and go and actually talk to some of these people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's Labor done for energy for farmers? The electrical bills have gone up by more than 30 per cent; they can't afford to pump water. And to add insult to injury, what are you doing? You're putting solar panels on good quality agricultural land. You're putting solar panels on land that grows good-quality food and fibre that feed the nation. This is what you actually need to happen. Electricity bills are going through the roof under those opposite, and this is after a promise that we would be $275 better off. Where's that? 'By 2025'? Here we are. Electricity prices are going through the roof. Why not provide some cheaper electricity so that farmers can grow some more cane? The cane photosynthesises, pulls carbon out of the air and is better for the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're talking about water, what about cutting all the dams? That's the other thing you've done. For Urannah Dam in my electorate, there was a commitment for $480 million, and what did those opposite do? They came in, slashed and burned. When you slash, you can't grow anything without water. But you probably wouldn't know because you probably don't know what a farmer looks like. Then there's the killing off of the agricultural visa—what a turnout that is—just to keep your union mates happy. What about the workforce shortages? It's absolutely ridiculous. It's clear that Labor is no friend of farmers, fishers and miners. Vote them out at the next election. Get rid of them. Get us back on track.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I thank the member for Hunter for this opportunity to recognise our agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors and our agricultural workforce more broadly. It's a pleasure to follow the member for Hunter, the member for Paterson and the member for Gilmore in this debate—all very fine regional representatives. As a representative of a regional electorate myself, I'm proud to be part of a government that is delivering for Australian farmers and producers. In my own electorate, the agricultural sector is one of the highest employment industries, second only to the healthcare sector, with around 10 per cent of my constituents directly employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing. More broadly, Tasmania's agricultural sector is a major contributor to the state's economy. In 2023 farm-gate value exceeded $2 billion for the first time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is continuing to deliver practical support for Tassie's farmers and for our regions. At the end of last year, I joined the Tasmanian Minister for Primary Industries and Water at Greg Gibson's farm at Hagley. I spoke to Greg and other local farmers about the recent completion of the Greater Meander Irrigation Scheme augmentation project—that's a mouthful!—and what it means for their business and the wide industry in Tasmania. The federal government invested $5 million through the National Water Grid Fund to this project, which included upgrades to pump stations and new pipelines to transfer water more effectively and efficiently across the Meander Valley. For producers like Greg, secure access to water for farming means increased confidence and security to grow and develop farming operations, and this project is just one of the many that confirms the Australian government's ongoing support for the Tasmanian agricultural industry more widely, particularly for Tasmanian irrigation. I know it's got bipartisan support, which I'm pleased to see, but I like to make the point whenever I can that the Tasmanian irrigation scheme was started by Labor. I know those opposite like to talk about how they're the friends of the farmers, but it was David Llewellyn, when he was the Minister for Primary Industry and Forests in a former state Labor government, who got this on track with the support of farmers. It's been a raging success for our shared state ever since. Deputy Speaker Archer, I know you know just how well Tasmanian irrigation works. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased as well that our government is investing more than $150 million to deliver the Greater South East Irrigation Scheme down in the Sorell region. That will drive further economic growth in Tasmania in what is a particularly dry part of the state. Powered 100 per cent by hydroelectricity—I think the member for Dawson's head will explode when he hears that—it will provide water to grow iconic Tasmanian produce like cherries, apples, salad vegetables, grapes, stone fruit and olives. I myself live on an old sheep paddock in that region, and all those places used to be the wheat belt back at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. To see these high-value products being grown in the region is just spectacular. An extra 37 gigalitres of water will be available to farmers in Tasmania's South East every year. That's the equivalent of almost 15,000 Olympic sized swimming pools every year. I'm not sure even Ariarne Titmus could get through that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also announced last month a further $20 million for the On Farm Connectivity Program to help farmers utilise new technology. Across Lyons, many producers have taken advantage of this innovative program so far, enhancing on-farm connectivity to monitor activity with real-time data, improve safety and increase productivity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, farmers now have a government willing to work with them to meet our shared ambitions on sustainability and adapting to climate change. Together, we are developing a plan to reduce the sector's emissions and position Australia as a world-leading producer of food and fibre. Throughout their time in government, the coalition wilfully ignored the science and failed to act properly on climate change and its impact on farmers. They ignored the Australian agricultural industry's calls for action. Industry peaks were left to go alone, and of course Farmers for Climate Action was born; it now has very active chapters nationwide and particularly in Tasmania. There has been inaction by the coalition. Climate change has dramatically reduced farm profitability, with ABARES modelling indicating an average loss to farms of 23 per cent, or close to $29,000 per farm, over the period from 2001 to 2020. Our government is getting on with the job. We are protecting farmers. We love representing farmers, fishers and foresters, and we're getting on with the job. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week in the House, I briefly highlighted the peril of communities in the southern part of my electorate due to the ongoing impact of bushfires in the Grampians National Park and Little Desert National Park. The first of these fires in the Grampians began 55 days ago, with the initial fire burning for three weeks near the 450-strong community of Halls Gap. The Grampians fire burned 76,000 hectares, destroying four homes to the south in Moyston and Mafeking, 41 outbuildings and 540 kilometres of fencing. The fire also burnt 10,000 hectares of pasture and 1,285 beehives and killed 775 sheep, not to mention the incalculable cost to native flora and fauna. All up, including the subsequent Little Desert fire, which burnt the western two-thirds of that national park, over 230,000 hectares have burnt in the Grampians and Wimmera area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities near the Grampians National Park have been struck twice in 12 months by natural disaster, after a fire in February 2024 in Pomonal, Dadswell Bridge and Dunkeld, which destroyed 45 homes and cost the local economy an estimated $200 million and hundreds of thousands of tourists. The late-2024 bushfires closed the town of Halls Gap to the public over the lucrative December-January tourist season for 18 days. Some tourist sites remain closed today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fire related closures are having a cumulative devastating impact on the Halls Gap community, whose small businesses are struggling to stay afloat and are in desperate need of support. I invited Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton, shadow minister Perin Davey and the member for Wannon to Halls Gap. They heard from constituents who tell me that business owners are at breaking point, with many expressing the feeling of being abandoned by the government as they continue to hear reassurances about resilience rather than tangible support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Spending in Halls Gap has dropped by 63 per cent since the fires began compared to the same period last year. At the one-month mark, $13 million in business earnings have been lost. As the fires have persisted, an estimated further $8 million has been lost. The Grampians typically attracts between 1.3 million and 1.7 million visitors annually. However, cancellations are now extending until May 2025. Projections suggest that an ongoing reduction in tourism will see total losses in the region of between $34 million and $103 million over the year. This is simply devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is indisputable that businesses in Halls Gap are in dire need of government financial support, yet, as of the end of last week, the Allan Labor government had still not requested category D assistance from the Australian government under its Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements, DRFA, despite ongoing advocacy from every angle. Without this request from the Victorian government, Halls Gap businesses cannot access the maximum amount of funding—or any, for that matter—for recovery from these devastating circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Insurance costs for some Halls Gap businesses have almost quadrupled since the Pomonal fires in February 2024, with one business paying $55,000 for public liability insurance, which even then does not cover external fire and does not provide business interruption insurance, the very thing they need. There are 120 businesses that cannot get insurance in Halls Gap, even though there is no instance in history where fire has struck Halls Gap itself. I am working continuously with locals, the insurance industry and my coalition colleagues, including the member for Wannon, who is in the chamber right now, to look at solutions to this emerging wicked problem. Under the Albanese Labor government, insurance costs across the nation have risen 18 per cent. These fires, combined with the impact of recent wildfires in Los Angeles on global reinsurance markets, may combine to push insurance premiums up further and make policies even less accessible.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  Every regional MP—in particular, Victorian regional MPs—comes into the summer anxious. In my own electorate, we've spent the last few summers anxious about floods. Communities like Rochester, Heathcote and Huntly have been devastated in recent years by big flooding events. In other electorates impacted by bushfire, as we've heard from the member for Mallee and as we'll hear from the member from Wannon and the member for McEwen, who is sitting behind me, it is part of that responsibility that you take on with being a regional MP that, come the summer, you will get the call—I'm relieved that we have not been affected by bushfires so far this season—in the lead-up to Australia Day, that opportunity to go out and meet with your local CFAs and SES to talk about the conditions on the ground. Whilst it's dry in my part of the world, it's not devastatingly dry and scary dry, as they called it in the areas of western Victoria and northern Victoria, like we've heard about so far in this debate. What happens to a community when we have bushfires is devastating. Even more devastating is what happens to our community when those bushfires are continuing, like we have seen in the Grampians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 December last year, the Grampians National Park fire started. It's continued through January and into February. Boxing Day last year was forecast to have the worst fire conditions since Black Summer. That is how hot and dry it has become in parts of Victoria. Then the day after Australia Day, on 27 January, a fire broke out in Little Desert National Park. These fires have burnt, thus far, in excess of 115,900 hectares, and forecast weather conditions this week are due to continue to pose a high risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emergency personnel like our CFA, Fire Rescue Victoria and Forest Fire Management Victoria are entering their ninth week of battle. I want to acknowledge the many volunteers who put their lives on hold. They put their Christmas and New Year celebrations on hold, and now many of them are putting their work obligations on hold to fight these fires. We are truly blessed and lucky to have such dedicated volunteers to support our communities through these times of crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support is there for these communities. Through the Australian Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements, we as a government are co-contributing to impacted communities. Today the disaster recovery allowance has been made available for people in communities in the Hindmarsh, Horsham and West Wimmera LGAs whose livelihoods have been impacted by the Little Desert National Park fire. DRA provides fortnightly payments for up to 13 weeks to affected people who qualify. It is paid at the JobSeeker rate or the youth allowance rate depending upon the person's circumstances. The joint funding between the Victorian and federal governments around support for small businesses is also under discussion. The Disaster Ready Fund continues to act to help communities to become more resilient towards all natural disaster, from bushfire to flood, allowing them to prepare themselves for what may happen in the future. This is a fund which we benefited from in my own electorate, where we've seen funding go to Campaspe Shire, Mount Alexander Shire and the City of Greater Bendigo to help mitigate the effects of future floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Insurance is worth a debate, and it is a debate we need to have soon and quickly. It is alarming to talk to business owners and homeowners who are starting to go down the path of not insuring because they can't afford insurance. That is why this government established an Insurance Affordability and Natural Hazards Risk Reduction Taskforce in May 2024 to look at insurance affordability, and we look forward to their recommendations. It will require a whole-of-economy approach towards this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My heart goes out to those affected in Victoria. None of us want to see this in our community, and I wish them well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I commend this motion to the House, and I thank the member for Mallee for bringing it forward and for her cooperation in working with me on it. This is an incredibly important motion. It's really just calling for one thing, and that is: would the Victorian state government please move quickly to provide additional support and help to these communities in and around the Grampians—Halls Gap, Pomonal, Dunkeld and others—that have been impacted by the bushfires which have ravaged the Grampians since just before Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say is that people have been out doing their bit throughout this period of time, and the selflessness has been extraordinary, but the time has come for businesses in particular to get a little bit of support and help. The member for Mallee knows that. I know it. Everyone who can go and have a look—and I encourage everyone to do so—will see it firsthand if they just speak to local businesses. Yet for some reason the Victorian state government does not want to move quickly. Well, I say to the Victorian state government: please move quickly and help and support these communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To know and understand what has happened in and around the Grampians over the last six weeks is to know that a fire has raged like no other, and we have seen volunteer and professional firefighters do an extraordinary job keeping communities safe. The fact that they've been able to contain that fire, to protect communities, when we have had some of the worst conditions you can have when firefighting is quite remarkable. To every volunteer and paid professional who has been out there keeping this fire within the bounds of the national park, I say thank you. We've seen periods where it has got out, and the way they have acted to bring it under control has been remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While that has been happening, these tourist towns—Halls Gap, Pomonal, Dunkeld—have suffered. The reality is—and you can't blame them, but this is the reality—as soon as people, especially from cities or from interstate or from overseas, hear that a fire is burning, they tend to cancel their bookings and go elsewhere. They don't think, 'Well, perhaps we should wait until it's under control and then honour our booking.' They just don't do that. What that means for business is their normal peak period, what I would call their 'shearing period', when they make the majority of their money—the Christmas period, the New Year period, the Australia Day long weekend period, and now we're heading to the Easter period. That is when they maximise their income for the whole year, and that has just been taken away from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we had the Leader of the Opposition come down—we visited Halls Gap and Pomonal—we heard firsthand about that, about how businesses had stopped for this period. They've had to watch their stock waste because the people weren't there for them to service. And they love servicing the tourists that come. That's their pride and joy. They love the communities they live in, and they want to make sure that, when people come, they are there and are ready to give them the best tourist experience they possibly can. But that hasn't been able to take place, and that is why we need the Victorian state government to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the Victorian state government needs to do is put that claim in to the federal government so it can be assessed. They've done category A and category B. That is a big tick, tick. But now it is the businesses that need help and support, and that's why they need to move quickly on that, and that's why I want to support and commend this motion. The member for Mallee has been on the ground. She's heard about the experiences that these businesses have been going through. I have, too. We want to ensure that herculean effort that has been undertaken by those to keep the communities safe is backed by the government coming in and supporting the businesses that need it at the moment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300122" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  The ongoing bushfires in western Victoria, particularly in the Grampians and Little Desert National Park, have caused severe damage, as other speakers have discussed. These fires, which ignited in December, have continued to burn into the new year, fuelled by strong winds and extreme heat. As of now, more than 100,000 hectares have been burnt, and conditions remain highly volatile.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities in and around Hindmarsh, Horsham and West Wimmera have faced mass evacuations, the destruction of homes and businesses and significant disruptions to daily life. The psychological and financial toll on residence, business owners and emergency responders has been immense. Families have been displaced, and businesses have suffered severe setbacks. The tourism industry, the economic backbone of towns such as Halls Gap, Pomonal, Dunkeld, Dimboola and Nhill, has been particularly hard hit. Road closures, infrastructure damage and widespread cancellations of bookings have left local businesses struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, despite these hardships, the resilience of these communities has been extraordinary. Neighbours have opened their homes to the displaced. Local businesses have donated essential supplies, and volunteers have worked tirelessly at relief centres, providing food, shelter and emotional support. Community groups have organised fundraisers, and people from all walks of life have come together to ensure that no-one faces this crisis alone. Their strength and solidarity will be central to the long process of recovery and restoration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To support these communities, the disaster recovery allowance has been made available to individuals whose livelihoods have been affected by the fires in Hindmarsh, Horsham and West Wimmera. This financial assistance has already been activated for residents in our Ararat, Northern Grampians and Southern Grampians, providing crucial relief to those who have lost income because of these disasters. For small businesses, we recognise the immense strain these fires have placed on operations. The federal government continues to work in partnership with the Victorian government to assess additional assistance measures. For the established disaster recovery funding arrangements, we're co-funding essential relief efforts, including debris removal, counter disaster operations and the restoration of critical infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the member for Wannon and the member for Mallee for working collaboratively with the minister throughout this crisis. Their collaborative approach, along with the strong engagement of the Victorian government and Minister Vicki Ward has been instrumental in supporting both immediate relief and the longer-term rebuilding and recovery process. The efforts of our emergency services personnel during this extremely challenging time cannot be overstated. Firefighters, volunteers and first responders from across Victoria and from interstate have worked tirelessly to protect lives and property. I particularly recognise the local CFA crews in my community who have given up their time over the Christmas period to battle these fires and stand ready to defend our communities and those around us. A very special mention must go to the CFA crews from Bacchus Marsh, Blackwood, Melton, Toolern Vale, Myrniong, Greendale, Coimadai, Diggers Rest, Parwan, Rowsley, Eynesbury, Wildwood, Bulla, Balliang, Mount Wallace, Sunbury and the legends at my own brigade in Ballan. These men and women left their families to defend our community and others in extreme and dangerous conditions. Their sacrifice, bravery and unwavering commitment to keeping our communities safe deserve our deepest gratitude.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This remains a dynamic and dangerous situation. Without significant rainfall, the threat is far from over. The federal government will continue working closely with the Victorian government to assess ongoing needs and provide the necessary resources for recovery. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by these devastating fires. We send our best wishes to all those impacted and we stand with you as we rebuild stronger than before. I urge everyone to stay informed by monitoring emergency updates and following the advice of emergency services.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I commend the member for Hawke for his contribution. He commended the member for Mallee and the member for Wannon, which I will do in a minute. Sometimes in this House there are, rightly, political disagreements. We go at each other politically when we need to, but motions like this have bipartisan support. I thank the member for Hawke for his service. I know he is a volunteer firefighter in the CFA. I'm happy to hold him to account politically, but thanks is due to the member for Hawke for his contribution, as well as to the member for Bendigo, the member for Mallee and the member for Wannon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many communities have been devastated by bushfires over so many years. Unfortunately, it's the Grampians that have gone through this tragic event in the last six weeks. It's not just the Grampians community that have been impacted—they have been impacted directly, but the brilliant thing about Victoria is that we all come together to support each other. On the weekend, I was having a listen-in post in Mount Evelyn, and Rick, who is the captain of the Mount Evelyn CFA, was walking through. We were having a good chat; he had just got back recently from the Grampians, having been over there as part of the strike team keeping the community in the Grampians safe. On Sunday I was presenting an Australian flag to the team at Coldstream CFA, and many of them, including their captain Sean, had been in the Grampians helping out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many brigades in my community have been in the Grampians supporting them, and that is the vital nature of our volunteer spirit. Our volunteer CFA members protect their own communities, but they are prepared to leave their families and their friends and their loved ones to go to another side of the state or into another state to protect another community. They do it for two key reasons. They do it because they know it's a core part of their responsibility to serve—to serve as volunteers—no matter where the need is. But, just as importantly, they do it because they know that if their community is in trouble and their community needs support—like our community needed support 16 years ago on Black Saturday and in the months afterwards—the CFA brigades from the Grampians and from all across Victoria, as well as firefighter volunteers from all across Australia, will come to help. It is that volunteer spirit that we need to continue to celebrate while we rebuild.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It couldn't have come at a worse time for those in the Grampians. It's a key tourist time for those businesses. They've been devastated by many cancelling, so I urge people: if you can, please visit the Grampians to support those businesses. As the Deputy Speaker would know, it's really challenging when you go through that short period of loss, but then there are also ongoing effects. It is never just about the days and weeks of that tragedy; it is about the months and years afterwards—the mental strain and the economic strain—that then put more pressure on businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many are now unable to get insurance, as the member for Bendigo said. This is an ongoing challenge in the Grampians, but, in many communities, including my community, whether it's due to the bushfire risk or the storms that the Dandenongs have had repeatedly in the last four or five years, many businesses and homes cannot get the insurance they need. We need to continue to work in a bipartisan way to find some solutions, because it is not an easy fix; it is a challenging dynamic. We've seen the floods up in Townsville. Many communities are going through disasters. We need to continue to work together to find solutions and to make sure that Australians and businesses can get the insurance that they need. It is something that is, as I said, an ongoing stress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also so hard for many people in our community because it brings back memories of other fires that they've had to go through themselves. Every time there is a fire, it can cause challenges for many people. I would say those people are feeling the stress of the Grampians fires. They are feeling the stress in my community from the memories of Black Saturday. I was at an event on Friday night, talking to some people and reliving the events of Black Saturday, 16 years on. It's not something that leaves us. I want to say to those that are struggling at any time: please seek the help that you need, because you are not alone. There are many to support you, and we need to continue to support those in the Grampians today and in the months and years to follow.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building Wyndham's future begins with investing in education. As a local educator of 27 years, I know this more than most. It is in a Labor government's DNA to ensure that every Australian child has the best opportunity to reach their potential, to develop their thinking, to develop their capacities and to go on to make a contribution to our country. That is why it is so important. This Labor government has got their backs, from our littlest Australians to our most aspirational students at university. They've got the backs of the families who live in the city of Wyndham.</span>

The latest data shows that families across Australia have saved up to $2,768 since the Cheaper Child Care subsidies came into effect in July 2023. This is cost-of-living relief, but it also goes to this government's commitment to quality education and support for families. We're supporting the workforce who deliver this quality education and care, investing $3.6 billion to support a 15 per cent wage increase over two years for early childhood education workers across the country. This means that we will attract quality people to this workforce. We will maintain and retain experienced workers in early education and child care. It goes to our commitment—</span>

                  </a>  This federal Labor government's commitment to education can also be underlined by the school funding that has just been announced. I'm talking about the national partnership agreement that's just been signed with the state of Victoria, which means an estimated $2.5 billion in additional Commonwealth funding to all Victorian public schools over the next 10 years. This is critically important for communities like mine with many, many families and thousands upon thousands of school children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What my community now knows is that the Gonski review found three critical things. The first thing that Gonski found—and that people need to understand—is that there was very, very little fat in the state education system across this country. It was a lean financial machine and still is. The second thing the review found was that need based funding works and is required, and, of course, that's rolling through. The third thing Gonski found was the secret sauce—what's called the Schooling Resource Standard. In school terms, I'd say, as an ex-principal, SRS is: what is the magic funding number where, if every student in a state school was funded to that minimum standard, we know we could provide everything our students need?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the Labor government's commitment means that Victorian schoolchildren will get their SRS based funding in every state school in Victoria. That is great news for communities like mine, where people really value education and really value what's happening with their young person and how they're developing in that space. This funding is focused on excellence, equity and improving wellbeing for learning. Some of it supports student wellbeing and promotes a strong and sustainable workforce. Attracting skilled people into our classrooms is critically important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last piece is TAFE and vocational education in the higher education space. In an aspirational community like mine, where people are really aspiring to get that degree and get that masters—in the city of Wyndham, we have the highest number of PhDs per head, next to Carlton, coming out of places like Point Cook, Williams Landing, Tarneit and Truganina, where our new and emerging communities are very aspiring. What we've done there is we've capped the HELP indexation rate, which is already reducing the cost to students. And, if elected, we will take 20 per cent off HECS debts across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That leaves me with 26 seconds to give a shout-out to fee-free TAFE. What a difference this is making in communities like mine for people who want to retrain or for young people who are looking to find the thing that they want to do but who don't think they're destined for university. Fee-free TAFE is unlocking opportunity in the suburbs around this country, and in no suburb is it more important than in mine in outer-west Victoria. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  I rise to speak against this motion that's been moved by the member for Lalor, and I do it for a number of reasons. First of all, I was glad I was present for the honourable member's speech today when she moved this motion. This motion refers to cheaper child care, record needs based funding for schools, free TAFE and student debt relief. What this motion refers to—and all that I have heard from the honourable member's speech—are just the amounts of money that are being spent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are opposing the fee-free TAFE legislation, and it is not because we do not support the vocational and educational training sector. On the contrary, we support all students who want to get a vocational educational qualification, regardless of where they choose to be educated. That is the whole premise. That is one of the major differences between our side and Labor. Labor love a centralised bureaucracy. I heard mention then of the public school sector. I'm very supportive of the public school sector; I'm proudly a product of public schools. But it was the Liberals who first decided to fund non-government schools, and that was one of the guiding values of our party—that parents should have choice as to where their children are educated. Parents who choose to send their children to a non-government school should not be punished for that choice, in the same way that students should have the choice as to whether they go to a non-government school or attend a government school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that Labor has only funded places in the VET sector for TAFE is because the TAFE system is centralised; it's very heavily unionised. They love TAFE. They don't, for example, want to fund the National Electrical and Communications Association, which has 500 to 600 apprentices at the moment all doing training through the private sector. That money is very well spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At TAFE, people in the building and construction sector at the moment—trainee apprentices in carpentry–have only a 50 per cent completion rate. If they do it privately, they have a 90 per cent completion rate. It's the same with plumbing. Master Plumbers have an 80 per cent success rate of getting their apprentices through. TAFE has 50 per cent. Why won't this government look at where their funding actually goes and the results of that funding, instead of simply saying, 'If we just throw money at the problem, we'll fix it'? There's no point just throwing money at it without then looking at if the money that is being spent—taxpayers' money—actually producing bang for buck. We cannot support that sort of reckless spending with no regard to the outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this motion leaves out something very big in this whole piece, and that's the NDIS. It does refer to needs based funding in schools. Well, NDIS is on its knees. I have had that many people in my electorate come to me with the most horrendous stories. I'll give you the most recent horrendous story, which is on Saturday, when I was in the Engadine mobile office, from Sarah, who has a 10-year-old son Issac. They have now had to cease essential disability support services because they have not been able to get a reassessment of their plan for almost six months. This is a disgrace. What happens when she goes to NDIA to finally put in a complaint? This is the response from the NDIA: 'The NDIA appreciates the time you've taken to provide your complaint. Here's a feedback reference ID, and, if you require any support, please visit our website.' This is a family that are on their knees. Issac has significant needs. That is what the government have left us with—this mess that NDIS and NDIA are in. I know there are many in this place very committed to disability services; I am one. This government has failed in that space.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  I'm very proud to speak to this motion that has been moved by the member for Lalor, because it does give me an opportunity to talk about the great changes and improvements that this government has made to education. We believe in universal access to early childhood education. We believe in ensuring that every child, regardless of their postcode, has the resources that they need for schooling. We believe that we should be removing and reducing the fee barriers that are preventing a number of young people from starting a TAFE course or university degree, impacting their ability later in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll start with school funding. I am the proud mum of a Victorian school student. My daughter, Daisy, started at Camp Hill Primary School on Monday. I was so pleased when I dropped her off that morning to know that the school that Daisy and her friends go to is on the path to receive the same funding as the Catholic and independent schools her other kinder friends have been enrolled in. It is unfair that before this point there was a disproportionate funding arrangement in that independent and Catholic schools were already receiving the school resourcing standard—already receiving 100 per cent of the committed Commonwealth and state government funding throughout Australia—yet our public schools in many of our states were not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've corrected that. We've reached an agreement with the state of Victoria, as well as with a number of other states, that sees those public schools now on a pathway to receiving the full resourcing standard. On Friday I had the opportunity to talk about this increased funding and what it would mean for a number of schools in our area with my state counterpart, Maree Edwards, and the principal of Crusoe College. In the principal's words, it will mean 'smaller class sizes'. It will mean 'greater diversity of extracurricular activities and programming' and 'more subject options'. It will mean that every student will get the resources they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fee-free TAFE is an area where Labor and Liberal do divide, on the difference that fee-free TAFE is making. We are in a skills crisis in this country, and the creation of those pre-apprenticeship course offerings and free TAFE opportunities for those skills that we don't talk about a lot—like vet nursing, for example—is encouraging more people to pursue further education and get the skills required in those areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the apprenticeship payment that our government has announced. Apprentices starting on 1 July will receive a bursary, a scholarship or a payment if they continue to do their studies at six, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. That top up will help pay for the cost of living so that they keep going with their apprenticeship.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With university student debt relief, the changes that have already come in, people in my electorate are saving thousands. In particular, women who've taken time out for caring arrangements are seeing that their debts have been reduced. People who choose to work in a career that pays less than others, who take longer to pay back their debts, will now have less debt to pay back because of our changes. If we're re-elected, there will be a further cut to student debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there's ECEC. Where do we begin with the great reforms that we've brought forward in ECEC? It is a combination of these reforms that needs to be focused on. We are trying to move the sector from the traditional childcare model, which was about making sure that someone was there to care for the kids whilst mum went back to work, to a universal early childhood education system. This is about the education of our youngest Australians, making sure that all families and children have access to at least three days a week. Scrapping the activity test is critical for that. We're paying our early childhood educators more through the changes that we made just last year. We're keeping talented educators in the system. We're making child care cheaper through the reforms of the subsidy. We're working with the states and territories to make sure that we address the desert areas like those in my electorate, where we don't have enough childcare centres—or even a single childcare centre—because of the nature of the town. We're helping to subsidise them so that they exist. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to education and to investing in education. We're saying to families that, regardless of the age of your child, regardless of your postcode and regardless of the school you choose to send your child to: we are equalling the playing field and making sure that funding is there for you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  Education is the foundation of our society. It is the key that unlocks opportunity, prosperity and a better future for all Australians. Labor is strengthening our education system from the ground up. Since coming to government, we have taken significant steps to invest in education at every level. We have expanded access to early childhood education, making it more affordable for families and saving the average family over $2,700 per year. We have supported the early childhood workforce to attract and retain the best educators by providing these staff a 15 per cent wage increase. We have invested in our universities to ensure they remain world-class institutions. We have provided tens of thousands of Australians with free TAFE as part of a multibillion-dollar skills agreement, helping more people gain the qualifications they need for secure, well-paying jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our commitment does not stop there. We have secured one of the largest increases in public school funding in Australia's history, because every child, no matter their background or postcode, deserves a high-quality public education. Under this new agreement, the Commonwealth will provide an additional five per cent of the schooling resource standard to Victorian public schools, which will increase funding by $2.5 billion over 10 years. This is the largest-ever investment in Victorian public schools by the Australian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just about more money. What truly matters is what funding delivers for our students and teachers. As education minister Jason Clare has said, this agreement will provide more individualised support for students who need extra help, a commitment to evidence based teaching practices that are proven to improve literacy and numeracy, and an increase in mental health support in schools to ensure students have the wellbeing services they need to thrive. This agreement will also include reforms to help students catch up and finish school. This includes a year 1 phonics and early numeracy check to identify students who need additional support, because the earlier we intervene, the better their outcomes. It also includes initiatives to support training teachers. With this investment, we hope to increase the number of students who graduate year 12 and increase the proportion of students achieving strong and exceeding skill levels in reading and numeracy, and we hope to boost student attendance and provide better support and training for teachers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is building Australia's education system from the ground up. From strengthening child care all the way through to university, we know how important a strong education system is for our country. The Victorian school funding agreement will mean an extra $2.5 billion for Victorian public primary and secondary schools over the next 10 years. By 2034, Victorian public schools will be fully funded for the first time in history. That means millions of extra dollars for schools in Hampton Park, Lyndhurst, Lynbrook, Narre Warren South, Clyde, Cranbourne, Botanic Ridge, Devon Meadows and Pearcedale, ensuring that students in Holt will receive the education that they deserve. An extra $2.5 billion for Victorian public schools may sound like a lot, but this is not just spending. This is an investment—an investment in our children, an investment in our workforce and an investment in the future of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows a strong and well-funded public education system does not just benefit students; it benefits the entire nation. A child who receives a great education grows up to be a skilled worker and a thoughtful citizen. A strong education system means a strong economy, a fairer society and a future where no child is left behind. This is the future Labor is building. This is the future this government is delivering. And this is why we will always invest in our kids, our schools and our great nation.</span>

                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  From the moment we are born, we are being educated. Some say that even before that they talk to the unborn. They sing and recite poetry because they are so eager to introduce the idea of beauty and a world of beautiful possibilities. Education shapes and transforms us. Everyone on this planet is entitled—yes, I'll use that word—to the best education their families, friends and society can give them. We are all teachers. Those who choose the noble profession of teaching must believe with every fibre of their being in the possibility of good and growth in everybody, regardless of their age, whose education is entrusted to them. Teachers are not simply minding the children or keeping the older ones entertained. Their job is to inspire and to prepare their students as best they can for the world as it is becoming, and that is quite a job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important things the Albanese Labor government has done, one of the greatest testaments to its deep commitment to the Australian people, is the boosting of wages for early childhood education and care providers. When we delivered a 15 per cent pay rise for early educators, we showed them the sincerity of our respect for what they do. It's part of the reason we have 41,900 more early childhood educators. Dedicated people are no longer being forced out of their chosen profession because they're trying to make ends meet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is a fundamental human right. To confine or limit someone's education is to confine and limit their lives. For individuals, that's a crime against their individuality and humanity. For society, it's colossally stupid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's reforms have already seen 97,000 more children in early education. More than a thousand new early learning services are open, and we're investing a billion dollars more to build even more. Our investment in our schools has produced more individualised support for students, more health support and mandated evidence-based teaching practices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we aspire. The Albanese Labor government is determined to increase the proportion of students leaving school with the year 12 certificate by 7½ percentage points nationally by 2030. Our Better and Fairer Schools Agreement 2025 to 2034, which began on 1 January—and Western Australia was the first to kick it off—puts every public school on a path to 100 per cent of the school resourcing standard. We are determined to improve education outcomes for all Australian students, wherever they are, whomever they are. That requires commitment to equity and excellence, wellbeing for learning and engagement, and a strong and sustainable workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong and sustainable workforces are based on a commitment to skills development of all kinds. Free TAFE is part of Labor's pledge to Australia and to Australia's future—to make it a strong, healthy, sustainable future in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex global environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't sit around waiting for things to turn out okay in the end. We can't drift along as the coalition did for almost a decade. Perhaps the Liberals and Nationals imagine that everyone who wants to learn skills at a TAFE can afford to pay the fees. Certainly the member for Hughes, who I'm glad is still here, had the gall to suggest as much. Well, they can't. The numbers who have flooded in since we started providing free TAFE places demonstrate that—more than half a million. That's more than half a million Australians voting with their feet and half a million reasons why the coalition is wrong to oppose free TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November, we announced more: a 20 per cent debt reduction to help the three million Australians with a student loan debt. That alone removed $16 billion in HELP and other student debt. Our changes to cap the rate of indexation applying to student loans to the lower of the wage price index or the CPI backdated to 2023 removed another $3 million in debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government believes in action. We believe in work, and we believe in a future where everybody gets the chance to be all that they can be and to contribute all that they can, because that's where hope comes from and that's where self-respect comes from. Our commitments are in Labor's DNA. They always have been.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One more little measure that those present who live in the regions would surely appreciate is the university study hubs. We have one coming in Northam, where I went to school. I certainly would have appreciated it. And we have one now for my electorate of Hasluck, in Ellenbrook, allowing students access to the support they need to further their studies if they can't study at home. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good to hear people waxing lyrical about education. I think it's something that all of us agree is really important for the future of our nation. We've got to have an honest debate about how we get the outcomes we all want to achieve. I think there are some real challenges in education in this country at the moment. I don't think things are going in the right direction, and there's a lot of data to suggest that. In fact, OECD data shows that Australia's education standards have fallen since 2006, with Australia ranked 12th for reading, down from sixth; 10th for science, down from sixth; and 16th for maths, down from eighth. We need to have the analysis as to why we think this is happening. The data and many of our experiences in the education system show us that behavioural issues and disruption in our classrooms are key reasons why education standards are slipping. I'll talk about some experiences that I've had, and then I'll talk about what the Senate committee found.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many years ago I was asked to be principal for a day at a state school in Shepparton, which means I got to shadow the principal and work with the staff. What I saw were a lot of teachers who were there because they were very committed to educating young people. They were very committed to doing it in the state system, because they wanted to give everyone a fair go, as did my mother, who was a teacher at Shepparton High School for well over 30 years. But increasingly they were finding that they couldn't do what they were there to do, which was to teach, because there were a lot of behavioural issues coming into the classroom, and the system wasn't giving them the tools to deal with those behavioural issues. I saw kids outside trying to cool down because they'd blown their stack in the classroom, and I saw children being disruptive. There are cases where children have been violent, and assaults towards teachers are up. So we really need to understand what's going on here and try and work through it, because if kids aren't in a calm, safe environment, they can't learn, and if teachers aren't in a calm, safe environment, they can't teach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the coalition's pushed request on 28 November 2022, the Senate referred the issue of increasing disruption in Australian school classrooms to the Senate Education and Employment References Committee to inquire and report on the issue of increasing disruption in Australian schools' classrooms. There were a number of recommendations. I haven't got time to read them all out, but I'm just going to precis a few of them and then question whether the Albanese government in its funding agreements can focus on this very issue of behaviour and disruption in the classroom and get to the core of it. Senate recommendation 8 states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that the National School Reform Agreement Ministerial Reference Group consider including strategies for addressing disruptive classroom behaviour as one of the priorities for the next National School Reform Agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'll go to another recommendation. This was recommendation 3:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that government and non-government education authorities are required to invest in the professional development of teachers, so that they are supported by the latest evidence-based teaching skills to manage classroom behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we need to give our teachers the tools that they need to deal with classroom behaviour, and it's getting harder. It's not like it was when my mum was a teacher in the eighties. Kids were coming from more stable backgrounds, in my experience. Now there are a lot of social issues—particularly since the COVID pandemic and the onset of social media. Disruption is becoming endemic in classrooms, and we need to focus on that and make sure we create environments to learn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm trying to understand where Minister Clare's funding agreements are up to with four of the states, because my understanding was that they were supposed to be done by 31 December 2024, and, in four of the states, we haven't seen the funding agreements. Not only do we want to see them but we also want to see whether there is any focus on this critical issue. As well as the curriculum and as well as increasing funding to schools, which are supported aims, we want to see whether there is a focus on this insidious and challenging issue that all of us are seeing and all of us are hearing about from the parents and the staff of disruption and behavioural issues in classrooms. It's causing a lot of problems with learning and a lot of problems with teaching, and it is seeing teachers move out of the sector—sometimes out of the state education sector and sometimes out of education altogether, and that's not what anyone wants.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  I'd like to begin my remarks by thanking all the teachers who showed up in classrooms today across this country. I'd like to particularly thank the graduate teachers who went to work today and had a bit of a tough day but will be back again tomorrow with a smile on their faces and a welcome for every student as they enter their classroom. Teaching is really complex. School leadership's really complex, and I'm glad that the member for Nicholls, in his one day as principal for a day, learned so much about the education system. I'm so glad that he wants us to use evidence based things in our schools, yet he came here with no evidence for most of the assertions that he just made! Seriously, it was riddled with errors. Where are the state negotiations up to, member for Nicholls? Perhaps you'd like to read a newspaper, or perhaps you could go to Minister Clare and ask for a briefing. The Victorian deal is signed, and every Victorian state school will be funded by the Commonwealth to 25 per cent of SRS, Member for Nicholls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you're a Victorian and you want to talk about Victorian schools, so let's start there. Let's start somewhere else. Bringing this here to the federal parliament of Australia really has more front than Myers. The Commonwealth assists in funding schools, but it does not run a school; states run schools. Second, I just want to make sure everybody understands the hypocrisy in mentioning the funding programs and the funding agreements when those opposite, when in government, dashed the hopes of a generation of teachers. They dashed their hopes that their work was finally going to be valued by a Commonwealth government, because they stopped the movement on Gonski. They told people, through their actions, that education was not valued in this country. In fact, what they did was cap the Commonwealth contribution to the SRS for state schools across the country at 20 per cent, but they didn't put a cap on private schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Nicholls, I have been principal for a day since I've become an MP; unlike him, I was a principal for a lot longer than that. That means I understand the funding models. It also means that I can go to the My School website and I can see right now where independent schools in this country are being funded by the Commonwealth more than state schools are being funded by the state. That is the legacy of a coalition government. So, for those who are listening in at home, just know that those opposite don't value education; those opposite want to criticise teachers. They want to criticise society. They don't understand the complexities of teaching at all. They want to talk about social media impacting our classrooms. If I have to hear from one more male member in this place about how they know about schools (a) because their mum was a teacher or (b) because they went to a school, well—as a profession, we'd like to be valued for the work we do, for the training we did, for the on-the-job training we did, for the perpetual learning that we committed to on the first day we walked into a school.</span>

The member for Nicholls needs to understand that he wants a magic wand to fix student behaviour and he wants the Commonwealth to magically find this magic wand. I'll tell you what happens with student behaviour: hard graft, professional teaching and learning, people committed to a profession and committed to student outcomes—that's what the magic bullet is. It's really, really complex, and no-one sitting on the benches in this place with no experience should be suggesting that they know the answers to these questions. They can consult, but one day as principal for a day does not make anyone in this place an expert on education or on schools.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From prep through to year 12, we have committed teachers walking into classrooms. They need to be respected for their professionalism. People in this place do not need to tell them how to do their jobs; they need to ask what supports they need to make them better at their jobs. That's what places like the federal parliament should be busy investing in. In terms of the OECD and the outcomes, the fundamental thing that the conservative government missed in all of this debate is that, in schools where there isn't a chasm in funding between private and public, they're performing better. But you don't want to hear that, you don't want to see that evidence, and you don't want to understand what it means.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of this motion brought by the member for Nicholls, and I thank the honourable member for doing so. I also commend the honourable member for spending a day at a school within his electorate. It's something that, I must admit, I've not done yet. I am going to do it, now that I've heard about it from the honourable member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that the confected outrage from the member for Lalor is really quite extraordinary. I don't know how it can be suggested by the member for Lalor that the member for Nicholls, an elected representative, cannot get up and speak about education within his electorate and, indeed, within his state and nation. I remind the honourable member for Lalor that the honourable member for Nicholls has been elected to represent his constituency and has just as much right to stand and talk about education—or about any other topic that he would like to talk about—as the member for Lalor. Simply because the member for Lalor was a teacher and a principal for many years does not mean that she is the only person in this place that has any right to speak on education. That is complete and utter nonsense.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms WARE:</span>
                  </a>  The bad weekend down in Victoria that my friend the member for Nicholls has just referred to could well be part of it!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Nicholls has brought a very important matter to this place, and that is that the government is yet again sitting on an inquiry that had many, many recommendations. The inquiry included a recommendation that the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority strengthen the focus on behaviour within the Australian curriculum by specifically introducing a behaviour curriculum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as an aside, I'd be very interested in a count being made of how many reports that have been done in this place and in the other place during the term of this government and that have been presented to the government have not been acted upon. I note that many, including me, have spoken in this place about the failure of the Albanese Labor government to act on the Murphy report on gambling. I cannot count the number of times that I have spoken on it. And I know that many others have as well. This is yet another inquiry where the government has the report, has the recommendations, but has said, 'Oh, no, that's all too hard,' or, 'We'll look at that on another occasion,' because it was proposed by the side of the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report goes to empowering teachers so that they can actually teach without things like chairs being thrown at them, without the disruption of students running around the classroom. I've been into classrooms. Thankfully, in my state of New South Wales, the government has banned the use of mobile phones in the classroom. When my children first started high school in 2019, I visited a local high school. I'm not going to say its name. It was showcasing the school for parents, who were supposed to be impressed by the school. We went into a food tech room, and there were three students at the front cooking and 10 at the back, all on mobile phones. And that was supposed to be acceptable: 'Oh, mobile phones aren't interrupting the education of our students.' Thankfully, that has been reversed in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm here talking about teachers, I want to talk about some fabulous teachers that are working in some great schools in my electorate, and I know that because I've been out to see them. I saw them at the end of the year and also throughout last year. They are Como West Public School, Illawong Public School, Hammondville Public School, Ingleburn High School, Macquarie Fields High School, Sackville Street Public School, Macarthur Adventist College, Menai Public School, Bangor Public School, Waterfall Public School, St Pat's Catholic Primary School and the beautiful Minerva School, which does so much to educate and support children with significant disabilities within our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I have to be honest here: I feel for the member for Nicholls. I reckon he would have come up with this motion and deliberated on it with his colleagues towards the end of last year. I'll at least give him credit here: the subject matter is important. It's important that the classrooms our children develop in are brought to the attention of this House. The Albanese Labor government is committed to advancing our communities from the ground up through education. For communities like the northern suburbs of Adelaide—and I've said this a few times now—education is the key to opportunity. It is the circuit breaker for disadvantage. It serves to lift individuals and families out of intergenerational cycles of poverty. Beyond that, thriving countries like ours are built off the backs of teachers, who will often give the majority of their lifetime towards educating our children. The education system deserves national attention to continue this progress we make, both as a national collective and as individuals, and this motion helps to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll also give credit to the member for Nicholls for another reason, and that's going back to the timing of this motion, because just a couple of weeks ago my home state of South Australia—our home state, Deputy Speaker Sharkie—signed a historic agreement with the federal Labor government, to fully fund public schools to bring our classrooms to the level they need to be at, to address the core of the issue the honourable member raises in his motion and to finally correct the record after years of ignorance from those opposite. That agreement was for the federal government to come together with the Malinauskas state government in South Australia and cover 25 per cent of the schooling resource standard. This is a federal Labor government doing what it does best: meeting the needs of our communities, including my community, where help is needed most on this front. This is an investment of an estimated $1 billion in additional Commonwealth funding over the next 10 years, which represents the biggest investment into South Aussie public schools in the history of the Australian government. This is a federal Labor government that gives a Gonski—one that is committed to a genuine lift in the standard of education in this country, to tackle disadvantage head on and level the playing field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the timing of this one, I reckon that if the member for Nicholls could, in the words of the great Cher, turn back time and find a way, he'd find a way to change this one up a bit, because I'm now going to chart what's caused the issues the member raises. Those issues are poor behaviour in classrooms, the negative impact on learning outcomes because of it, worsened morale in the workplace for teachers, and constant retention headaches for schools, which are especially prevalent in my community. Those opposite sat on their hands and watched these issues for nine long years, and Labor is getting things back on track. That journey started in 2011 with the Gonski review, which made a recommendation that public schools receive 100 per cent funding and that that funding go towards things like phonics tests, numeracy and literacy tests, and having support staff in classrooms to help with unruly children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to one of the primary schools in my electorate—one that I'm very fond of. I recently had the great good fortune of taking the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, there to meet the fantastic principal, Julie Murphy, her team and the wonderful students who go to learn at that primary school. Julie Murphy and her staff go above and beyond every single day to meet the learning needs of the young people who go to that school in my community. When I say 'go above and beyond', I don't just mean turning up and delivering classes. Julie Murphy and her team go out into the community of Elizabeth Vale, knocking on doors and getting young children dressed and brought to the school to make sure that they have the best education they possibly can. This sits outside of what the SRS is fundamentally there to do, but this is what great teachers do. This is what great leaders in our education system do. They 'give a Gonski'. They take the essence of education in its purest form and they know what that means for the young people that they're teaching. Without principals like Julie Murphy, and her team, we are worse off. This SRS funding is going to help with the retention of fantastic leaders and teachers at schools like the Elizabeth Vale Primary School, and I commend this motion. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  A message to Labor: you don't beat the far right and their billionaire and corporate mates by adopting their policies, taking their money in political donations and offering more of the same. We have seen it in the US. Trump blamed immigrants for the cost-of-living and housing crises, and what did the Democrats do? They acted tough on migrants, took donations from billionaires and basically proposed the status quo with a bit of tinkering around the edges. Well, we saw the result of that. Somehow they allowed Trump, a billionaire property mogul backed by billionaires like Elon Musk, to become the anti-establishment change candidate. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now Peter Dutton is blaming migrants for the cost-of-living crisis. What are Labor doing? They're passing some of the most draconian antimigrant laws this country has seen. That's what Labor are doing in response. They are breaking their own policy platform to adopt Dutton's policy proposal for mandatory minimum sentencing, and they're dumping their own environmental policy to please a bunch of massive mining corporations—oh, and taking donations from billionaires like Anthony Pratt, himself a supporter of Trump—and proposing basically the status quo with a bit of tinkering around the edges. Now Labor are somehow allowing Peter Dutton—the guy who rides in billionaire Gina Rinehart's private jet to special parties and thinks mining corporations should pay less tax than they already do—to become the anti-establishment change candidate, just like Trump. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and again we have seen far-right thugs like Trump and Dutton rise to power in times of economic crisis only after political parties like Labor utterly fail to offer any genuine alternative vision, one that directly addresses the cost-of-living and housing concerns of working people and offers an alternative narrative to the one offered by the far right. People are losing hope because the main opposition party is proposing radical right-wing change and the other party is promising basically more of the same. When more of the same is skipping meals to pay the rent, I can understand why people are angry. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But here's the real problem, and, if the Labor Party had guts, this is what they would say. One-third of Australia's biggest corporations pay zero dollars in tax. Meanwhile, two-thirds of all retirees who rent are living in poverty, skipping meals, sitting in the dark to save on their power bills and dreading their next rent increase. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real problem is not migrants. It's the fact that Australia's 159 billionaires more than doubled their wealth over the last few years to over half a trillion dollars, or $584 billion, while one in three single parents and their families live below the poverty line. That is over 300,000 kids with single parents in this country living below the poverty line. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real problem is that, over a seven-year period, five of the largest multinational gas corporations operating in Australia made $134 billion in revenue and, you guessed it, paid zero dollars in tax. Meanwhile, millions of Australians are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real problem is billionaires and big corporations wielding enormous power over our political system, and they use that power to make the vast majority of our lives tougher while using their ownership of giant media companies to blame migrants. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The silver lining in this context is that Australia has a very different political system to that of the United States. We aren't forced to choose between a far-right radical like Trump and more of the same in the Democrats. In Australia you can choose something else. Our preferential voting system means you can vote for the Greens and then preference whoever you like after that, and then you can make sure that you keep Dutton out but actually push for a hopeful vision—</span>

We can start to bring the energy system back into public hands so we don't have private energy companies ripping us off on our power bills to make massive profits. We can follow Norway and tax our gas industry properly, take that billions of dollars in wealth that is currently going offshore and put it into our country right now to do things like raise the pension above the poverty line, raise JobSeeker and other income support payments above the poverty line and make sure everyone in this country has a good life. That's what we're fighting for.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  When I see a motion like this, particularly from the Greens political party, it really reinforces to me that it is possible in this place to have aspirations that are quite close. I look at some of the aspirations in this motion—to build more houses, particularly for those who are vulnerable, to have a fairer tax system and so on—and I say to myself, 'I don't totally disagree with some of the aspirations that this motion is pointing towards.' But it takes more than aspirations in public policy and more than aspirations in the real world to get outcomes that mean things for people—the people that we ought to be representing in this place. What I think the Greens political party fails to do is move beyond listing a whole bunch of aspirations to, first, have the depth to come up with practical, well-thought-through solutions, and, second, in the midst of a political environment, move beyond being activists or a university debating club and get lasting outcomes that lead to real-world solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me point to an area that is a first-order issue when it comes to people's quality of life, particularly during this course of this parliament, and that is tax policy and tax relief—the stage 3 tax cuts. We can have a motion which says that we should tax more evenly, that we should tax in such a way that we give greater benefits to those who are more vulnerable, particularly in a cost-of-living crisis. What this government actually delivered was tax relief that led to tax cuts for every taxpayer but that was much more skewed towards those on low incomes than what was being presented to the parliament by the previous government. People on less than $45,000 would have received no tax cuts under the previous government's scheme, but under this government received more than $800 a year—meaningful increases in their disposable income during a time when people were feeling particularly squeezed. Eighty-four per cent of taxpayers—indeed, probably a higher proportion of that in my electorate—are better off under our tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is delivering meaningful, real benefits to people. The Greens political party will put forward all sorts of aspirations when it comes to the tax system: tax billionaires a gazillion dollars. I think that was the response of one of the technocrats out there, but it is meaningless. It doesn't lead to real outcomes for people that deserve them. Another area, perhaps one that best highlights the Greens as activists rather than genuine responsible partners, in government is housing policy. When this government put forward sensible reforms—the Housing Australia Future Fund, the Help to Buy scheme, the Build to Rent scheme—the Greens party, because it wasn't exactly what they wanted, or because it didn't go as far as they thought it should go, blocked it month after month after month. We see the housing difficulties this country is facing are all the more difficult because they prefer activism over getting an outcome. They don't do the hard work on the policy, they don't come up with practical solutions that are actually achievable and, in addition, their mode of operating in the political system and in this parliament is such that they would rather see nothing occur so long as they can keep going out doorknocking and cynically use an issue for political purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has achieved so much in housing—$32 billion of initiatives—plus free TAFE places, which have led to something in the order of 45,000 additional people being trained, which is going to do a huge amount for the supply side of this housing challenge. The Greens political party spent a year or more blocking many of these measures along with the Liberal Party. They should hang their heads in shame at the way they behaved this term. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion contains a number of parts that I agree are issues which require further action. But, on most of these topics, the government has delivered action, often in the face of ideological, activist and simplistic opposition from the Greens that has been entirely counterproductive. That's what we should look at when we look at the words of those opposite.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  Is there anything that sums up the Greens political party more than what we're going through right now—a performative motion full of wedge politics aimed to elicit an emotional response? I was expecting them to come up here and come out fighting. They didn't even show up! What's going on? It shows that they're performative politics at best. They put up the words and they don't back it with action. They will spread this motion out to their supporters and say how they're in Canberra fighting the good fight and they're in the Federation Chamber putting up this motion. Here we are today; it's 7.26 pm. We've got hardworking members of the Albanese government here speaking on this motion and putting the record straight, and they couldn't even be bothered to show up to debate their own motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That just sums up the difference between us. We come here and we work. We work to solve some of these problems that the Greens identify. They just identify the problems; they don't do much about them. They just talk about it or hold up their placards, but, when it actually comes to doing what we need to do in this place to change the lives of Australians, to make our tax system fairer and to help with the cost of living, they are no-shows—absolute no-shows. I cannot wait to tell my community about this—how the Greens perform out there in front of their supporters but then can't come here and actually have the debates that we need to move our country forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the Greens, I believe that multinationals should pay their fair share in tax. But, unlike the Greens, we actually do something about it. We came to government and made it clear that multinationals should not get away with exploiting loopholes and shifting profits offshore while hardworking Australians often pay more than some of these multinationals. For too long these big corporations have dodged loopholes and used these loopholes to dodge tax, whilst everyday Australians, like nurses, teachers and tradies—and small business owners, I might add—have to pay their fair share. That's not right. What do we do? We introduce laws to set global and domestic minimum tax for multinational corporations. We ensure that companies making profits in Australia pay tax in Australia. That is a government that works. That is a government that introduces the laws that we need, not just empty motions and no-shows here in the Federation Chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation was a critical step in line with our OECD global tax reforms. Under our change, any multinational enterprise with global revenues exceeding $1.2 billion will now be subject to a 15 per cent minimum tax rate. That'll end the race to the bottom on corporate tax dodging. If small businesses in particular in Ryde, Epping and Eastwood are paying tax on their profits, then multinational corporations making billions in Australia should be doing the same. This is real action. If you believed the Greens political party, you would think nothing is being done. This motion is about playing politics instead of supporting progress. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we took office, inflation had a six in front of it; it has now fallen to something with a two in front of it. Real wages are rising again. Unemployment remains at 50-year lows, and 1.1 million jobs have been created. These numbers represent real Australians with jobs, real families with more money in their pockets and a real difference in the cost-of-living pressures that people have been facing. We have been able to deliver this economic reform and deliver increased multinational taxes while also delivering cost-of-living relief. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you read the Greens political party motion, you would think that no Australian is getting that relief, and that is simply not true. We've had tax cuts delivered to every taxpayer—all 13.6 million of them. That's every nurse, teacher and tradie keeping more of what they earn, because we know that it's working people who drive this economy. This motion talks about Medicare as if it stood still in time, but the Greens political party know that's not the case. Labor has tripled the bulk-billing incentive—the biggest boost to Medicare in 40 years—ensuring millions more GP visits are bulk-billed and reducing out-of-pocket costs for families. We promised 50 urgent care clinics, but you know what? We've delivered more than 80—80 urgent care clinics to cut emergency room wait times and deliver cost-of-living relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've committed more funding to housing in three years than the Liberals did in 10. We've committed $32 billion to deliver rental homes, social homes, affordable homes and market housing, whilst also helping those renters who want to buy their first home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've wiped $3 billion in student debt, with more to come if we get re-elected. We're about action here on this side. When those opposite bother to show up, all they do is talk.</span>
