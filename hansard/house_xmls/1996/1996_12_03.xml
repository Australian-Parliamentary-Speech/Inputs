screen jockey hot trading? How does that compare with the Prime Minister's statement last night

They have still not recovered. We unashamedly like low interest rates. They give opportunity to
business and they give opportunity to home buyers. It shows what an increasingly irrelevant and

the opportunity to try to rework the forecasts, in which matter you were unquestionably wrong. That

        The current situation in Cambodia is tense.
Events over the last few months have led to increased strain in relations between the main
political parties in Cambodia. There is also the possibility of further terrorist attacks by
remaining hardcore elements of the Khmer Rouge. Later this afternoon I will be meeting with the
Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, who is also responsible for police and the judicial system, and
I will make representations to him at this meeting to ensure that the Cambodian government does
everything it can to protect Australian citizens, including obviously those who work at the
Australian embassy. I also will take the opportunity yet again to seek assurances from the
Cambodian government that those responsible for the deaths of Australians in Cambodia will not be
given an amnesty and that continued efforts will be made to bring those people to justice.

        The Australian government's position on this is absolutely clear, and on
many occasions we have made these representations. In September, I discussed this matter with the
Cambodian foreign minister, Ung Huot, who is known to members of the House, and received assurances
from him that the Cambodian government would do all it could to bring these people to justice. I
again wrote to Ung Huot in late November in response to suggestions in the media that General Noun
Paet, who is one of the murderers implicated in the death of David Wilson, might seek an amnesty. I
underlined our position that we did not wish him to be granted an amnesty and that the Cambodian
government should fulfil its obligations to bring a murderer to justice.

        We are continually making representations on this matter. Let me say we have
continually been given assurances by the Cambodian government that they will bring anybody
responsible for the abduction or murder of an Australian citizen to justice. We look forward
eventually, in particular, to General Noun Paet being brought to justice, as he should
be.

         —One of
the proudest matters that the government was able to deliver on in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget was
capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. We delivered on capital gains tax rollover
relief for small business because we thought the taxation system should not penalise small
businesses that were trying to grow bigger and small businesses that were trying to create more
jobs.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        After we announced that measure, the government
engaged in an intensive round of consultation with small business organisations. On budget night we
had said that rollover relief would apply only where a small business rolled over the proceeds from
selling one asset into a like asset.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        After consultation with small
business, today I can announce, on behalf of the government, new measures to enhance capital gains
tax rollover relief for small business. After listening to small business, the government has
decided that the like&amp;hyphen;kind requirement for qualifying for rollover relief be dropped, that
is, small business will now be able to roll over from one asset to another asset without any
stipulation that it be a like&amp;hyphen;kind asset. This will give new improvements and new capital
gains tax rollover relief for small business. This is the government which consulted with small
business, this is the government which listened and this is the government which can now deliver in
a new way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Further, as a result of that consultation, we have heard
the request from small business that the period for reinvestment of the proceeds from the disposal
of an asset be extended to 12 months before disposal and 24
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         months after disposal. This gives small business people who are selling from one business and
trading into another an extension of time in which to roll over their capital sum to grow or go
into a new business.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The cost of removing the like&amp;hyphen;kind asset
in 1998&amp;hyphen;99 would be of the order of $50 million. This will be another boost to small
business, another delivery on the coalition mandate, another encouragement to small business to
grow bigger, and new opportunities for jobs in new, growing Australian businesses. This government
takes its commitment to small business seriously and this is a government which intends to
deliver.

        I understand that that letter, and in
particular that admission by Mr Mansfield, was the subject of discussions at the ACTU council in
Lorne. The ACTU council rejected the Mansfield admission, publicly repudiated the Mansfield
position and refused to take any responsibility whatsoever for the occurrence in that riot on 19
August. I do not see how it is that people like Jennie George, Wendy Caird and Sharon Burrow can,
in one breath, be attacking the provisions of our legislation as it impacts on women and yet seem
silent in the face of this evidence. Women members of the police force, some of whom would be
unionists, carrying out their duties are, as we now know, targeted for a vicious personal assault

might not be a bad idea that, in allowing you to determine the matter under standing order 78, he
might tell you what those words were. They seem to be extremely sensitive on this issue, and with
good reason, because it is by default that they stand accused. They have done nothing,
notwithstanding that they continually demand of this side of the House that we take positions on
practically everything. On this issue—attacks on women—they have been notably silent.
If the member believes he has been offended by some particular words, let him say what they
are.

I say to you genuinely, Mr Speaker, that I am completely at a loss to understand which words are

         —You are
absolutely right about that, yes. It is certainly true that in some circumstances residents may
indeed transfer between facilities because their needs change. In fact, I have to point out to the
House and to those listening that one of the features of our reform package is that, where you have
couples who have entered a hostel and one becomes increasingly frail, and they would normally under
the present or the former system have to move one person into a nursing home to receive the high
level of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          care, our system will allow that couple to stay
together. The subsidy we will pay will follow the degree of mental or physical frailty of the
resident. It is not about which facility they are in. So there is a very great benefit
there.

        I read an article in the

         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        recently that the new Leader of the Opposition in
Western Australia was claiming that he was going to fix this system. He was up there beating his
chest about it, saying he would not allow the separation of elder couples in hostel and nursing
home facilities. But the fact is he has no authority and no capacity to change the system. We do
have, we are changing it, and we will not put elderly couples through that separation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me finish my answer to the member's question. These changes that are often
made outside those circumstances are the choice of residents. The average total length of stay of
the small number of residents who currently move from a hostel to a nursing home is less than five
years. Very few residents will need to consider the payment of a second entry contribution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us keep in mind the fact that any unused portion of the entry deposit
is transferable back to the owner or back to the resident and is not kept by the establishment. In
the case of where they leave entirely or they transfer over, the balance will be paid back to them,
or to their estate as the case may be. The fact is that the owner of any establishment can draw
down only $2,600 per annum out of that entry deposit fee that is paid. The balance remains the
property of the person who has made the entry contribution fee. Residents who cannot afford to pay
an entry contribution will not have to pay in any circumstances, and the government will pay an
additional subsidy to help those individuals in their access of care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to make it clear that only those with the capacity to pay will be paying
an entry contribution fee, that access will be based on the care needs of the resident, not on
their capacity to pay, and that the government will pay an additional fee for those who cannot
afford to pay an entry contribution fee.

         —I thank
the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. Yes, I am aware of reports of waterside
workers being paid amounts up to $140,000. I have even heard reports of amounts in excess of that
being paid to waterside workers around the Australian waterfront. There is plenty of anecdotal
evidence to substantiate those claims made on ABC TV.
        </para>

       <para first-indent="16">
        Those claims were made in an ABC news broadcast last week in the context of
excessive overtime payments being made to waterside workers working at the port of Melbourne. This,
in anybody's book, would be described as outrageously high levels of pay for the type of work that
is performed on the Australian waterfront—outrageous, too, when you compare the level of
productivity that our Australian waterside workers produce on the Australian waterfront.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at our productivity level on the Australian waterfront, it is
around half that of those countries that we have to compete against. If you go to Europe, you can
find container movements per hour in the order of 50 container movements per hour. Here in
Australia, our average movements come out at around 20 container movements per hour. You can go to
the United States and find 40 containers being moved per hour as the norm in the United States. You
can go to Malaysia where 30 container movements per hour is the norm compared with 20 container
movements per hour here in Australia.

        These excessive rates of pay
for those people who produce so little would be, by anybody's description, deemed to be outrageous.
But this is even more outrageous in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         light of claims made by
people in the Maritime Union of Australia that they did all of this without industrial disputes
over the last 13 years of a Labor government. I directly quote the joint national secretary of the
Maritime Union of Australian, Mr John Coombs, who said on ABC radio, with the passing of the
workplace relations bill:

       </para>
       <para>
        That claim that there has been no industrial dispute on the Australian waterfront over the
last 13 years is completely and utterly dishonest. The truth is that, from 1986 to the end of 1995,
days lost per employee on the Australian waterfront actually increased, not decreased. They did not
go down to zero but increased.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What you can see is that their low
productivity, their increase in industrial action over the last 13 years and their enormous pay
levels are causing enormous damage to the Australian economy. These are the people who prospered
well under a Labor government. These people on the Australian waterfront are Labor's
battlers—Labor's battlers earning these amounts of money. Those battlers that Labor has
represented—and who have so prospered during Labor's 13 years of government—are costing
their fellow Australians lots of job opportunities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These job
opportunities that are lost are highlighted in the paper of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce
released today on the waterfront and its performance. Their press release states:

        Australia rates last in an international comparison of 18 ports. Waterfront

business around $1 billion a year.

        These costs of $1 billion a year and more to
business hurt the real battlers in Australia—those people without a job. These are the people

not the sorts of six-figure sultans that the Labor Party supported on the waterfront during their

        It has been the fact that over a long period
of time, when a person migrates to Australia in the family migration area, there has been an
expectation that there would be an assurance of support and there be an obligation assumed by the
family that obtains the benefit of having their family member able to enjoin them in Australia in
preference to other migration applicants. In relation to those who come through the business and
skills program, there is also an expectation that those who come with those skills ought to have
the resources to be able to maintain themselves after they arrive in Australia.

        There is nothing remarkable about these propositions. Since the time of
Federation in one form or another sponsors have been expected to give assurances of support, bonds
or guarantees to ensure that such obligations are met. It was only under Labor that the system of
assurance of support came into disrepute. They did not take it seriously. They failed to expand it
to the full range of social security payments, so there would be some payments that would be
covered and if you could get on that one you could get on another. Despite overwhelming evidence
that a bond is more effective as a means of enforcement, they applied the bond only to a very
limited number of migrant categories and they failed to index the bond over that period of
time.

        The government has sought to ensure that the obligations that

used. What have we had? We have had the shadow

to hold out that he expects sponsors to meet those obligations, but when it comes to the measures
that will ensure that people are not able to access benefits or that the people who benefit from
having their relatives here give assurances, meaningful assurances, that can be enforced, they want
to deny us the opportunity of ensuring that not only one but both measures cannot operate.

Yesterday, I asked the Prime Minister a question without notice on health insurance and the extent
to which he was aware of certain matters involving an increase in MBF's premiums. The Prime
Minister's answer was, `I will have a look at the answer and then I will give you a response.' In
the past the Prime Minister has sought to give us answers that afternoon when he takes the question
on notice. To the best of my knowledge no answer has yet appeared 24 hours later, and I wonder
whether you could either write to or make inquiries with the Prime Minister to find out when an
answer might be forthcoming.

a question concerning premium increases by MBF. My answer is as follows: I do stand by the minister
for health's statement. The inference in the honourable member's question that health insurers are
seeking and obtaining premium increases under the current government that are either excessive or
not linked to the issue of prudent financial management is simply not backed up by the facts. Over
the period 1984&amp;hyphen;95, private health insurance premiums across all tables increased by an
average of almost 12 per cent a year. In the two&amp;hyphen;year period between 1986 and 1988, when the
Labor government was in power, premiums increased by a massive 40 per cent in only two
years.

         The previous Labor government received nearly
200 applications from the major private health insurance funds for premium increases and to my
knowledge did not seek to alter one of those 200 applications. For 13 years the Labor government
neglected and disparaged private health insurance as a core element of a balanced health care
system. The difference between the attitude of the previous government and the coalition, which has
lived up to its election commitment to provide rebates to assist low income Australians to retain
or take out private health insurance, could not be more stark.

        As I remarked
when the member for Hotham asked his question, I am surprised that the matter was not brought to my
attention when it allegedly occurred. Had this been the case, any appropriate action that may have
been required could have been taken at that time. I remind honourable members that, as stated in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         House of Representatives Practice
        </emphasis>
        on page 225:

        In regard to the question asked by the
member for Hotham, I have decided that no useful purpose would be served by introducing a
parliamentary version of trial by video so long after the event, particularly when the Treasurer is
on record as deeply regretting any offence or pain and suffering that may have been caused to the
member for Hotham.

        In regard to the matter raised by the member for
Hunter, I am confident that the member for Paterson will endeavour to give him a wider berth during
divisions. Again, I remind honourable members of their duty to conduct themselves in an appropriate
manner in this chamber. I hope that it will not be necessary for the House to be diverted by, or as
a consequence of, matters of this nature in the future.

        —Your
statement, Mr Speaker, misrepresents the text of my interjection in debate on the Hindmarsh Island
Bridge Bill on 5 November. I first raised this matter with Hansard on 6 November when, upon reading
the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Proof Hansard
        </emphasis>
        , I noticed an error in my recorded
interjection. Following a newspaper article by Mr Piers Akerman on 10 November publishing this
error, I contacted the Chief Hansard Reporter, Mr Harris, on 12 November to ask him to check and
confirm the accuracy of my correction of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        record. Mr Harris then wrote to me on 15 November as follows:

       In
telephone conversations, Mr Harris informed me that both the audio and video tape did not record my
voice interjecting on the member for Barker. I have listened to the tape myself, and the only
interjection it records is the member for Banks, although not in the words attributed to me.

       Mr Harris also explained to me that the shorthand Hansard reporter,
recording the member for Barker's words, did not hear my interjection. I repeat: that person did
not hear my interjection. The shorthand reporter reconstructed the words I might have said on the
basis of how the member for Barker then responded to them in his speech. Mr Harris informed me that
the only
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       record—and I understand that it is
taken as the pre-eminent written

       Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, who was in the chamber at
the time, has told me that his best recollection is that the member for Barker responded to
something which I did not say. I have been misrepresented, because you have now asked Hansard to

        I wish to report to the House on my recent visit
from 22 to 26 November to the Philippines for the APEC leaders meeting. This meeting marked the
start of the hard work of
        <break page="7513" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         turning APEC's free trade
rhetoric into reality. It began to turn vision into action. I believe that the meeting was very

agenda.

        In Manila, each APEC member economy tabled an individual
action plan which set out steps each would take towards the Bogor commitment of free and open trade
and investment for developing economies by the year 2020 and developed economies by the year 2010.
These plans were reviewed and recommended by APEC trade and foreign ministers at their meeting just
before the leaders meeting. I wish to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the
Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) for their contribution during the
year to producing such a successful outcome in Manila.

        While for the
most part the plans contain steps to which economies were already committed under the Uruguay Round
or unilaterally, they provide proof that APEC economies remain committed to removing tariff and
non&amp;hyphen;tariff barriers to trade and to freeing up investment. They thus set an example we hope
non&amp;hyphen;APEC members will take note of. I wish neither to exaggerate the achievements of the
plans nor to undervalue them. They were a good beginning.

        They
contain some new commitments of direct and early benefit for Australian business which in turn will
create jobs for Australians. That is why we will continue to press for greater liberalisation of
trade. For example, in the mining sector, the Philippines will lift import restrictions on coal.
Thailand will liberalise its natural gas market. In agriculture, Hong Kong will relax import
restrictions on rice by the year 2000 and controls on the stockpiling of frozen meat and poultry.
Japan will introduce new quarantine measures expected to expedite Australian exports of fruit and
flowers.

        There will be other new opportunities for Australian

to increase the number of licences for foreign banking, insurance and

         securities organisations. Thailand will increase the number of joint ventures in
the insurance sector. Singapore will gradually open up the domestic banking sector to greater

investment restrictions on investment institutions.

commercial presence for foreign accounting firms and improve market access for foreign
lawyers.

        The plans provide for each economy a consolidated picture

        Australia has already
reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most member economies. Like every other government,
mine will take account of what other economies are doing in deciding future steps. But our position
is a positive one, based on the assessment that liberalisation will bring overall benefits to the
economy. Australia's own action plan demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to trade
liberalisation. This commitment is not a matter of ideology, but a consequence of the government's
conviction that liberalisation within the region will help sustain the region's economic growth,
will open up increasing market opportunities for Australian exporters, will help promote
Australia's own economic growth, and will create jobs and improve living standards in Australia.
APEC can help ease the costs of economic adjustment caused by liberalisation and globalisation
through maximising the opportunities those same forces provide to increase our exports.

        As I said in my first intervention during the leaders meeting,
globalisation is the most potent economic force in the world today. It is important, in order to

their electorates the overall benefits of liberalisation.

mathematically precise reciprocity, but for APEC to work there has to be continual movement across
all sectors and all economies have to see the benefits for them—that is, in APEC language,
the principles of comprehensiveness and comparability are important to the success of APEC's trade
liberalisation process.

        In that respect, I found the APEC leaders

repeat his support for maintaining the momentum of liberalisation, as expressed during his recent

        APEC is an important element in the government's
efforts to improve market access, growth and employment, but only one element. Externally, APEC is
only one strand of our trade policy, which focuses also on gaining access at the bilateral and
multilateral levels. APEC can be of assistance by providing opportunities for bilateral discussions
on action plans and in imparting greater dynamism to the World Trade Organisation. The call by APEC
leaders for the World Trade Organisation to conclude an information technology agreement is one
such example.

        In turn, the government's trade policy is only one
element in its overall strategy to lift growth. Living cheek by jowl with the fast growing Asian
economies does not of itself assure success. We not only need the market access but also need to be
competitive. The government's budget deficit reduction strategy, its reforms of the labour market
and reduction of red tape are, likewise, important components of the government's program to lift
economic growth, employment and living standards. All of these are key ingredients in the
government's approach to industry policy.

the value the government places on Australia's relations with the Philippines. I note in the press
this morning some remarks of the finance minister of the Philippines drawing very strong attention

That growing involvement of the Australian business community has been one of the very good

        By the time the

our region.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is terribly important to note the role prime
ministers and foreign ministers can play in regional affairs. Nothing is static in international
relations. There are moments which you can take—to use a cliche—at the flood, to
achieve things which, if you leave them on a backburner, if you do not deal with them at the time,
cease to be opportunities in the future, and a great chance is lost for a real advance in
international relationships in any particular area.

        This was a
decision taken by Bob Hawke, Gareth Evans and Paul Keating at the flood. I think it is virtually

that initiative had not been there.

        The thing about people like Paul
Keating, Gareth Evans and Bob Hawke is that they punched above their weight, the weight of this

        If I have one major
disappointment with the remarks the Prime Minister has just made to us, it is that neither in his
presentation at APEC nor in his presentation here today is there the slightest evidence of anything
other than an almost traditional Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting approach—good chaps
chatting about good issues in an important way and making unexceptional statements. At the end of
the day, you need to do a bit more than that if you are an Australian leader. We have to bat very
clever indeed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I think this government really does have to sort out its
attitude to multilateralism and bilateralism. The one criticism they made of our foreign policy was
insufficient aggressiveness in bilateral trading relations. Aggressiveness in bilateral trading
relations these days is not an unknown factor in the international political system. There is a
great deal of it. What aggressive bilateral relations generally constitutes these days is picking
up a multilateral agreement, like that associated with the WTO, and getting into international
legal circles or into bilateral relationships and punching somebody's head off. That is basically
the sort of thing that has happened to us since we have pursued aggressive bilateralism.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is multilateralism, in fact, which is more the order of the day for what
dominates regional affairs in a cooperative fashion. The bilateral role, in so far as there is a
bilateral role—it is not unimportant—constitutes the softer approaches in international
relationships of pursuing trade missions, of putting forward exhibitions of your country, of
raising very
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         specific matters that relate to affairs between
two nations. That bilateral forum is not one in which you can resolve major trade issues unless you
go super aggressive. As the government well knows, having had to handle it, we have been a victim
of some very considerable aggression on this so-called aggressive bilateral basis.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you are punching above your weight, it has to be said that aggressive
bilateralism will find you out very quickly. I think we have been found out in one or two areas of
this very quickly. If you are going to do things bilaterally in the softer areas, as I mentioned,
you need to do them fulsomely because the opportunities are there.

also took the opportunity to be somewhat more discursive in discussions with a number of

foreign policy and of bilateral relationships between Australia and India. The Prime Minister's
failure to put a day or two into that was a tragedy. There was a real opportunity there for a Prime
Minister wanting to initiate things in international affairs to make his mark because there is a
degree of vacant space as far as that relationship we have with India is concerned. That vacant
space was not filled. The Prime Minister missed a very useful opportunity to fill it.

         The APEC leaders forum, as the
Prime Minister has said, does provide an opportunity for leaders to meet. It is now starting to
perform quite a critical function. Leaders will not simply sit around and talk about trade matters;
they will want to talk more discursively about regional affairs. We are beginning to develop in the
Asia-Pacific region something that resembles the sort of security community that people are used to
in other regional areas of the globe be it in the Middle East, central Europe or western Europe.
What that involves is a number of nations sorting out diplomatically for the first time in the
experience of most of them the types of regional arrangements that guarantee security. These
leaders meetings are critical in that regard. They are not just critical for being an opportunity
to get to know each other. If that is all they are then they are useful but not crucial.

         If APEC is going to continue to have the meaning that it ought to have, if
the leadership meetings associated with APEC are to continue and still be reflective of a
willingness of all leaders to attend, then that is the part of APEC which is most at risk. That
requirement on leaders to attend, because they are all busy people and they do not go just to meet
good chaps, is totally incumbent upon those of us who really believe in the organisation to
actually put forward initiatives and sometimes those initiatives will need to be outside the trade
area.

         I think there were a number of areas we could have advanced a
little further at APEC than we did. I would like to have seen more of an effort on bringing in
observer status to a number of nations which are on the borders of the APEC region. I would also
like to have seen more opportunity taken to utilise APEC as a forum for establishing further a
Chinese role in global affairs. It is a very difficult task we have to pursue—the appropriate
integration of China into the international political system. The ASEAN regional forum is doing a
very good job on that. APEC is another forum where those issues can be pursued. It is a broader
regional base than the ASEAN regional forum.

can make an argument about that but, nevertheless, that is the case. Though there is a much higher
focus on trade matters at APEC, you will not simply get leaders coming out year after year or every
couple of years to APEC functions unless those leadership meetings can supply that broader based
capacity for diplomatic initiatives, coming from countries like Australia.

reason is that the Chinese government of the day basically accepted us as people of honour.

           The
problem with the Prime Minister is that he will never admit a mistake. He will never retreat from a
bad position. He will never admit it. It does not matter even if it happens to be about whether he
has appropriate mechanisms for establishing the probity of his ministers. He sets up a set of
standards for the probity of his ministers and finds that his ministers cannot conform with them,
particularly when any minister is capable of putting the weights on him. So the problem is not the
administration of it but the policy. The policy has to be changed to fit the circumstances of what
the Prime Minister is proposed to bear.

           I asked the Prime Minister a
question yesterday that gave him a chance to correct the position that he put forward. He seemed to
understand that he made a bit of an error. He got up and said, `I should not have said what I said
on that particular occasion, but I have decided on a new approach to that now. I will not correct
that in relation to the Indonesians. They are important to us, but I will never again establish a
hierarchy in our relationships around us.'

believe from this point on that the relationship we have with Antigua is the same as the one that
we have with the United States, that the relationship we have with Belize is as significant to us
as the one that we have with Japan and so on. It is obviously the case that some relationships are
going to be more important to countries than others. You would not say, for example, that the
relationship with a nation of the size of Papua New Guinea would necessarily be very important to
Australia, but it is important for the simple reason of its geographic proximity. Likewise with
Canada. Canada to the United States would simply be your average middle power but for the fact that
the US shares a border and a long history with the Canadian people. So therefore they have a
completely different attitude to them.

            We have an attitude to the United States because we have been defended by them.
That is why they are substantially important to us. We have a relationship with Japan that is
enormously significant to us because of the development of patterns of trade and investment in
association with Japan. We have a relationship with Indonesia which is critical to us because of
geographic proximity and the fact that we live forever together in this region and we simply have
to get on. It is entirely appropriate to establish a hierarchy of relationships in international
affairs. Simply because you are embarrassed about it is no reason to walk away from it. So the
Prime Minister does not get himself off the hook for that very substantial error of omission in the
remarks that he made in answer to the position that I put forward.

reason why that perception is abroad is that of the errors I have already referred to, essentially
errors committed by his foreign minister. But they are also errors of his own. I referred to one
just a moment ago. The other was the extraordinary speeches the Prime Minister made in Indonesia,
which when you dovetail it with his relegation of them in the hierarchical order must still have
President Soeharto scratching his head as to what they were all up to.

nobody is used to hearing it before, you are entitled to think that the person who makes it for the

somebody else's initiatives. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the other ministers who were up
there indeed had a good set of ministerial consultations between the Indonesians and themselves at
the time. They were good because the Indonesians took control of the agenda and dealt with it.
Indeed, the one great initiative out of that—and it was a really terrific
initiative—whereby we now jointly go into partnership dealing with development issues in
eastern Indonesia was an initiative of theirs, not of ours. That was the most substantial thing to
emerge from it.

that we had nothing therefore to say to them of very much moment at the time is a disappointment on
our side. And a great deal of work will have to continue to be done by them to sustain the

above all, I have to say, in the sorts of partnership agreements that we have in the electronics
industry, feeding off the very substantial purchases in the Australian economy of Telstra. The
improved export performance largely in this region has been exponential—from $50 million in

         —Never
has a new government so quickly betrayed its constituencies. This was a government elected on a
promise to help Australian industry. It promised to keep the computer bounty established by Labor.
It promised to keep Labor's 150 per cent tax concession. It promised to ensure 10 per cent of
government purchases went to small business. It promised not to cut Labor's export assistance
schemes. And, most importantly, it promised to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing by the turn
of the century.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the government have delivered on
none of these. The reason is that we have an industry minister who cannot deliver for industry. The
Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) delivers compliantly only for Treasury. It is
worth looking at what he has delivered for Treasury to the detriment of Australian industry. In his
first year he delivered a $4 billion cut to industry assistance. Well done, Minister! A 27 per cent
cut to support for industrial research and development, with more to come as the cuts bite in the
out years. He allowed the 150 per cent tax concession to be traded to Tim Fischer's leadership via
the diesel fuel rebate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        His only defence, as he told the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        , was that it could have been worse. `Treasury
actually wanted to cut further,' he said, `and pip, pip, haven't I done well!' Not only has he
broken a promise but it could have been worse, and he expects industry to cop that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He allowed himself to be mugged by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in abolishing
research and development syndication. So thin was the justification for the decision that he put
four examples into his press release. He called them `actual examples' and yet, as his department
admitted in the Senate, not one of them was an actual syndicate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We
have now got the Wright family moved into research and development syndication. But, unlike
Minister Vanstone, who had the decency to turn up in the Senate, admit a mistake and apologise,
there was no apology
        <break page="7524" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         from this man—no apology
for the fact that he has misled the House. He also got mugged over the Howe Leather affair,
allowing himself to be given the job of finding an adequate compensation package—something we
have not yet seen come forward. He is still working on it no doubt because he knows that he has to
come up with some form of compensation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We also have to realise that
he delivered on the abolition of bounties not only for the computer industry but for the Australian
book industry, the machine tools and robotics industry and, of course, the shipbuilding industry.
We know his own backbenchers have some serious concerns now about the shipbuilding bounty. His
Western Australian colleagues are lobbying him to reverse this decision—as well they should,
because Labor argued from the very beginning that they should reverse on this.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have seen a huge growth in the shipbuilding industry in this country because
of the bounty scheme. Regional centres all around the country from Fremantle to Hobart to Darwin to
Brisbane are all in the shipbuilding industry because they got support. But this government has cut
that assistance from them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You have got the backbench of the Liberal
Party wanting to know why the minister is prepared to look at a compensation package for Howe
Leather but not for the shipbuilding industry in Western Australia. The minister has attended that
state on two occasions and has not taken up the request of the shipbuilding industry to meet with
them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have the Premier of Western Australia supporting Labor in
its call for the retention of this ship bounty. But it all falls on the deaf ears of the minister.
We have suggestions of the Western Australian senators crossing the floor on the shipbuilding
industry issue. We will be interested to see how they vote, to see whether they do vote for
Australian jobs and for jobs in Western Australia or whether they, like the minister, are prepared
to continue to be mugged.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He has also been rolled by the Treasurer
on a submission that sought to implement government election promises on government
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         purchasing. This was his latest defeat. He had briefed all the
journalists about how his first major initiative on industry policy was going to be the utilisation
of government purchasing. It is another promise that the government said it was going to honour but
which is now completely in tatters because the minister has been rolled by the Treasurer
again.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a person who does not get rolled just by the
Treasurer in this government; he happens to be so ineffective he gets rolled by committee
secretaries as well. We have Senator Tierney refusing the minister's request to set up a bipartisan
parliamentary committee to look at ways of ensuring the future of the Australian steel industry.
What could be more important to the regional centres of Whyalla and Newcastle and Port Hedland in
the Pilbara? But the minister will not embrace the bipartisan approach, because his committee
secretary will not allow him to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But even on arguably the most
important promise—to deliver 200,000 new manufacturing jobs—he has also failed, because
he has participated in decisions which will significantly reduce the number of manufacturing jobs.
He has not even asked his department to tell him how he can achieve the 200,000 target.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But if you thought that was enough, wait, there is more! The other day he
called for a further review of the programs of his department. The minister said he hopes the
review will not be used as an excuse for further cuts to industry assistance. He hopes! Under him
industry has got no hope. How much faith can Australian industry have in a minister who has been so
ineffective in such a short space of time—particularly in light of the fact that the review
is to bring down an interim report by March, in plenty of time for the Treasurer to use it to pull
more money out of what he calls business welfare?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Industry,
Minister, does not want any further cuts. It wants a government with a vision for Australian
industry. It wants a statement of industry policy by this government and a commitment to programs
which will support Australian industry in its development, in jobs growth, in net export growth and
in correcting the current account as well
        <break page="7525" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         as the
deficit. It is for those reasons that, as an important response, the Labor Party is opposing in the
Senate the measures that have been proposed by this government to cut industry assistance.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Funding for research and development and for bounties are not costs in the
budget; they are investments in the future of the nation. They lead to higher growth, they lead to
increased jobs, they lead to regional economic development and they lead to net exports—all
of the things that you say you aspire for this nation but for which you are prepared to put nothing
in place to help achieve.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So complete has been the betrayal of
Australian industries and so concerned are they about the direction this government has so quickly
moved to that there has been a litany of calls from business groups in the community for this
government to articulate some sort of vision of industry policy. You can go through the headlines:
`Industry calls for a complete industry policy'; `Industry looks in vain for policy'; `Industry
policy has no vision, say chiefs'; `More flack flies over Canberra's industry policy';
`ACCI'—the greatest supporter of this government—`sights on industry policy'; and
`Industry calls for a vision'. This is a damning indictment of industry policy under this
government, and from the people who were looking to you for the sort of support they expected to
get out of the place.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have to acknowledge that people on this
side of the House happen to like this man. He is a nice man. He can actually be very pleasant
company. But the fact is that as a minister he is a dud. He is totally ineffective. He could not
represent anything. There are rumours that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is
looking for fresh fields—Foreign Affairs—because of the debacle that the Minister for
Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has created. But if Mr Reith really wants to test his leadership
credentials against the Treasurer—and we know how keen he is in that regard—what better
place to do it than in the industry portfolio? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should reflect on
this as he thinks through his first major reshuffle.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Labor's approach to industry policy draws a clear contrast with that of the
coalition. It recognises that there is a role for government in industry policy, that there is not
a level playing field in the international marketplace. The policy focuses on securing jobs in
existing industries and making the most of the potential for jobs growth in new ones. It is about
identifying the opportunities for this country and realising the potential. It is a more active
approach. It is explicitly interventionist and it recognises the limits of the free market
philosophy. It also actively encourages and supports manufacturing industry as well as the new
high-growth, high-skill service industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst such a policy
approach signals a more interventionist approach, it does not mean a return to the old,
inward&amp;hyphen;looking protectionist approach. Indeed, that is an approach that the National Party
wants to pursue. That is the division that is going on in the debate. It is a free market approach
in the Liberal Party and a protectionist and Black Jack McEwen approach in the National Party.
These must be great debates. No wonder industry has given up on getting a vision out of this
government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Neither is our policy one that involves a `dead hand of
government' approach. It is not about propping up poor performers. Rather, our approach involves
working with industry and regions to develop and support industries and firms that embrace best
practice and that are internationally competitive.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We do support the
continued opening of international markets. We as a government invested too heavily in the Cairns
Group, in the GATT outcome and in the APEC approach—as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr
Beazley) has just spent some time going through—to let that go. So we argue that the approach
we are pursuing has to be in the context of aggressively pursuing more open international
markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, because our approach involves a much greater degree of
industry input rather than being simply government driven, the intervention or assistance that we
advocate may vary from industry to industry, from region to region. It may mean, for example,
better
         <break page="7526" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          addressing market access issues. It means
more aggressively pursuing the bilateral focus but against the backdrop of the multilateral
framework that Labor put in place and Labor established because it was prepared to address
important issues of industry reform.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We went to the GATT
negotiations for the first time in the history of this country with a policy that said, `Do as we
say and as we are prepared to do.' The National Party used to front, as representatives of this
nation, for decades and say, `Open up your markets to our agricultural produce.' When those markets
said, `Yes, but what about you opening up yours to our manufactures?' they were dumbstruck because
they had no response. They did not go with clean hands; they did not go with integrity; they did
not go with consistency. Labor introduced that for the first time. That is why we now have the
framework. We are not going to let that go. But in pursuing it aggressively, in pursuing the
continued opening up, we are not going to be the only ones leading in the field.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other forms of assistance that could come by way of this interventionist
approach are: to encourage innovation across industry sectors through support for skill formation,
research and development and commercialisation; to better use the leverage of government
purchasing—something the minister has again failed on; better access to capital through
instruments such as pooled development funds; Commonwealth leadership and leverage to ensure the
development of major infrastructure projects; tailored assistance through, for example, the
bounties and factor F scheme; and a focus on industry plans such as the steel plan and the car
plan. This country needs an industry policy. In this parliament, it is only the Labor Party that is
committed to developing one.

        The government believes that it
is critically important for all industry in Australia, and for us, to get the economic fundamentals
right first, to clean up Labor's mess, to provide a stable, growing economic base before we
introduce changes to the direction of industry policy.

         What did 13 years of Labor government, 13 years of the accord,
13 years of the Kelty-Crean-Ferguson industry recipe deliver to Australian business? It delivered
nothing but regression and a bleak future. The Labor Party, the party that pitches itself as the
workers' party, abandoned Australian business. Under Labor, Australia had the second highest
interest rates among developed nations and the highest unemployment rate since the Great
Depression; the manufacturing sector was forced to shed over 200,000 jobs and has shown no net
growth in employment in the last 12 years; business investment declined to its lowest level on
record; Australia's average productivity improvement was just 0.9 per cent—half the world's
average for this century; foreign debt increased by 800 per cent; and real household incomes fell
by nine per cent. A dreadful record!
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The critical point is that
Labor's industry policy over the last 13 years, despite all the hype and despite the attempt by the
member for Hotham to put the best gloss on it, was not an industry policy which worked for all
Australian industry or for all Australian workers. The simple fact is that Labor's industry policy
failed Australian industry. Labor took their eye off the single most important part of the industry
policy ball—the state of the general economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I welcome this
debate today because it allows me to directly rebut the attempt by the member for Hotham to suggest
that there is no government industry policy. The government's industry policy is quite clear. It is
understood and supported by industry generally. Our policy is in two parts. The first step is the
short term—to get the basic economic parameters right. Most businesses receive no direct
assistance from the federal government. The most important thing the government can do for industry
is to get the economy right. In fact, as a responsible government, we have no choice. For this, we
make no apology.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Our first obligation on coming to office has been
to set the budget and to begin to rebuild the economy. We are now seeing the results. Interest
rates have come down. All businesses and all industry have benefited from this. I
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          make no apology for it being the first key step in our industry
policy.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The key part of getting our economic foundations right has
been the passage of the government's industrial relations legislation. The simple fact is that no
single piece of legislation has been more welcomed by industry in this country for many years than
the government's industrial relations legislation. It is time the Labor Party acknowledged this
fact. It is time the Labor Party clearly stated that they will not change the legislation in the
unlikely event that they will return to office. The first element of the government's economic and
industrial policy is bearing fruit. The fall in interest rates alone will help all Australian
businesses, as has the passage of the industrial relations legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second step in our industry policy is the longer term, and it involves three
priorities. They are designed to ensure that Australian industry fully prepares for the competitive
environment that we will face by the year 2010 as a result of our APEC obligations. Few businesses
fully understand the challenges they will face by the year 2010. However, the government is aware
of the significance of the challenge and has built the key elements of its industry policy around
the need to ensure that Australian industry is fully prepared for the opportunities which will come
to our industry by that year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first of our priorities is
therefore to adopt a clear investment strategy for Australia. Competition for investment is
becoming more intense around the world. Investment growth is vital for our national future as it is
the basis on which secure jobs are built. Attracting investment will be a priority for the
government. We will not be offering outlandish incentives, but we will ensure that Australia is a
welcoming and competitive environment for investment and that businesses are able to deal quickly
and efficiently with the federal government. Reducing red tape and the delays and complexity
involved in dealing with the government when investing in Australia is an absolute priority for the
new government. We will not be reducing standards, but we will ensure that Australian
         <break page="7528" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          government processing does not discourage
investment.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Research and development is the second of our three
priorities. I do not accept the criticism made by the member for Hotham of our recent changes to
R&amp;D arrangements. In fact, I find the criticisms of the opposition rather ridiculous. Their
track record is hardly one of distinction. Under Labor—under their so-called `clever country'
policies—Australian business expenditure on R&amp;D slipped to 18th out of 24 OECD nations,
despite billions of dollars spent on incentive programs. That is an appalling record. Australian
business expenditure on R&amp;D as a share of GDP was 25 per cent lower than the OECD average. That
is quite some record. In 1995 alone Australia bought $20 billion worth of technology developed by
other countries, despite Labor's promises to make Australia the clever country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, the syndication arrangements we inherited from the last government were
out of kilter. There was a disproportionate emphasis on the financial structures of the syndicates
rather than on genuine R&amp;D. The eight attempts by the last government to amend the system
underline this. Our new R&amp;D package, with a 125 per cent deduction and the START program, has
corrected this imbalance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Taken as a whole, our R&amp;D package is
very competitive by world standards. If the opposition was serious about supporting genuine
R&amp;D, they would support the passage of these changes through the Senate. I am particularly
concerned to ensure that as a nation we get the `D' part of R&amp;D right. We must encourage a much
closer relationship between those doing so much good research in Australia and business. We must do
more to ensure that Australia's research is turned into commercial reality right here in Australia.
It is critical if we are to have growth in secure jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third
priority involves ensuring that Australian companies gain fair access to world markets. As I have
said, our commitment to our obligations for 2010 under APEC is strong and not negotiable. But I
believe that, in making the concessions that have been
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          made
so far, the former government did not push strongly enough for full and fair access for Australian
companies to world markets. We must make sure that non-trade barriers do not subvert the move to
free trade. This will be the basis of our future APEC negotiations.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to these three priorities, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has also
announced the establishment of the employment subcommittee of cabinet. Through the work of that
committee, the government is developing policies to further assist Australian industry. Unlike the
previous government, we are concerned about issues such as the availability of capital,
particularly for small business; ensuring our work force is trained to meet the needs of industry;
maximising the benefits of strategic advantages; and ensuring that government interference in
industry is eliminated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of our industry policy,
Australia will have a much stronger and more favourable climate for business. The changes have
begun and will provide benefits for all Australians. We have already seen a fall in interest rates.
We want business investment in Australia and we are determined to encourage it. We are a business
and investment friendly government. We believe this is essential to secure jobs in the
future.

         In many ways, Australian industry, particularly manufacturing industry, is
at the crossroads. The Australian economy has come through an intensive period of restructuring
that has seen dramatic changes in the way Australia's management and labour perform their work. The
previous Labor government guided that process and established a macro-economic environment in which
industry could draw confidence and indeed could grow, and I mentioned the fruits of that labour
previously. We engineered a steady growth rate of four per cent, reduced the inflation rate from
double digits to between two and three per cent, we left this government with a declining
unemployment rate and, of course, interest rates were lowering as well.

Australian industry at this point in time, and it stems from a number of factors. There are doubts
about the capacity of the key economic spokespersons in the government to really get on top of the
economic task. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who has an economic record of failure. We have
a Treasurer (Mr Costello) who categorises four years of growth as five minutes of sunshine. We have

member for Ryan. We have all heard the recent debates in this place about this matter. These were
codes of conduct that successive Labor industry ministers lived by with distinction. The code of
conduct is very simple. Ministers are allowed to own shares. However, where there is a direct or
apparent conflict of interest with
         <break page="7531" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

portfolio responsibilities, the minister must divest. He must not trade in the shares that he
owns.

         We all know the political reasons why the Prime Minister did
not sack the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. What is more disturbing is the fact
that the minister seemed oblivious to the gravity of his political situation. He stumbled on in
question time with a lame duck defence that no-one believed, not even he or his Prime Minister,
certainly not the opposition and not the industry community in this country.

         What signal did this send to Australian industry? It said that Australian
industry had a minister who was prepared to violate a ministerial code of conduct for the sake of a
share killing on the Stock Exchange. It demonstrated that the industry portfolio was in the hands
of a man with no sense of ministerial propriety. It demonstrated clearly that they had a weak Prime
Minister incapable of enforcing even basic ministerial standards.

         Let us go through the range of industry policies that were cut in this budget.
They demonstrate very clearly the ineffectiveness of this minister. We have seen budget cuts to
Austrade and AusIndustry and to the NIES program, where funds have been cut by 17 per cent. This
was a program that had a success rate of 83 per cent. We have seen reductions in taxation
concessions for research and development. The Industry Commission found that concessions
contributed to net benefits to the Australian economy.

         We have seen
the scrapping of the bounties that were alluded to by the shadow minister for industry, science and
technology. Those bounties in ship building, books, computers and machine tools had all stimulated
economic activity and the exports of this nation. Yet this is the minister who allowed the other
economic ministers to roll him in the context of debate within the cabinet. These bounties are to
be scrapped. We have seen the government abolish the DIFF scheme and severely curtail the export
market development grants scheme.

public importance. It is quite ironic that the opposition declares a matter of public importance in
the three areas of jobs, growth and exports. These are three areas in which the previous government
let this country down badly. They are three areas in which the opposition brought despair to many

member for Corio is an equally impressive man—especially in his understanding of economics,
which is indeed very limited. Let me help him out. The fruits of Labor were indeed very sour
fruits. When the opposition was in government it brought this country to its knees. It was the
Labor government which gave Australia the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.
Remember that? It was the Labor Party which put Australia into a situation of uncontrollable debt.
It was the Labor government which believed in high interest rates. The opposition betrayed young
people across this country. It put people through the turnstile of endless labour market programs
which failed to bring real jobs. The end result was devastating for thousands of Australians,
particularly young people. It led to poor self&amp;hyphen;esteem, an unworkable system and a poor
outcome in the end.

        The previous government may have liked talking about the so&amp;hyphen;called `big
picture' approach. Remember the big picture approach? They were very good at talking about that.
But, unfortunately, they never even got close. You never even got close to the big picture, did
you? Instead, business and industry were left with a narrow&amp;hyphen;minded approach to problem
solving. In reality, the Labor Party's industry policy was based on two important features: high
interest rates and the unfair dismissal laws of the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr
Brereton). We have two high profile features here. The unfair dismissal laws in particular brought
headaches for many businesses and Australian families. In my own electorate of Petrie—I speak
to small business people; obviously you do not—small business owners are steering away from
employing full&amp;hyphen;time people. They employ casual staff when they are required.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The federal government has made a commitment
to get the fundamentals right when it comes to industry policy—something that you never did.
In fact, the most important thing that this government can do for industry is to get the economy
right. A key step has already been taken with the reduction of interest rates. Let's talk about
interest rates—a power mechanism—which were kept very high for too long. They were like
a noose around the neck of business and industry. But this government is not going to stop there.
We have a clear investment strategy, which is what is needed. We need to attract investment
opportunities and encourage growth. That is important for rebuilding the Australian economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Similarly, the government recognises that, to increase competitiveness, the
removal of red tape is necessary, as is removing the delay and complexity that can be involved in
dealing with government. The opposition let small business down. It allowed them to drown in a sea
of paperwork—a bureaucratic nightmare which not only was a detriment to business but also had
consequences for families and personal lives. Energies were diverted from making businesses viable
and providing young people with real job opportunities. The situation was that we had red tape on
doing business, red tape on how to do business and, in some cases, red tape upon red tape. You are
very good with red tape.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government established the Small
Business Deregulation Task Force. The task force has reported and provided recommendations for
consideration—recommendations which, I might add, have taken the interest of many people in
the Petrie electorate. The Micro&amp;hyphen;business Consultative Group has already been
established—you know that—and it has had a great impact on the establishment and growth
of micro business. Have you ever heard of that? Eighty&amp;hyphen;two per cent of Australia's
businesses are micro businesses. They employ fewer than five people.

         This is a government which listens to small business; a

         As a small business operator in the service industry and also in the personnel
industry, I know what it is like to run a small business. This government understands how hard it
is to run a small business. I know what it is like at the month's end to look at the figures and
know whether you are going to make it or not. We have already introduced a number of budgetary
measures to recognise small business and their impact on the economy. In the budget we have
introduced a number of economic settings that will support growth and investment. The theme of our
budget was fiscal consolidation. Does the Labor Party know what this is?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a very interesting matter of public importance. In the MPI there is
mention of sustainable growth and job opportunity. If the opposition understood fiscal
consolidation, it would understand that this is what fiscal consolidation is all about. The
government has three central objectives here: to increase national savings, to reduce the pressure
on the current account deficit—you do not talk about that very much—and to help sustain
economic growth over the medium term. We are looking at it over the long haul.

         We have at the moment the best climate that we have ever had. We have a low
interest rate and a low inflation environment for the first time in years. Under Labor we had the
highest interest rates ever. The Labor government crippled small business with its boom&amp;hyphen;bust
policies. This government has promised not to introduce any new taxes. Today we heard the Treasurer
(Mr Costello) reiterate
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that, from 1 July, capital gains tax
will be changed so that rollover relief will be available where assets of a small business are sold
and proceeds are reinvested in the same or a like business within 12 months. This will help
investment. Small business owners can claim capital gains tax relief of up to $500,000 if that
money is put into a superannuation scheme to fund retirement or if it is invested in a like
business. This is a very welcome move for business across Australia.

         Another area that I would like to talk about is the area of subcontracting. The

subcontractors in the building industry—absolutely devastating—so they are very

       <para>
        The amendments now before the House are amendments which were put to the
legislation by the government in the Senate and they relate to one specific matter. The objective
of these amendments is to enable the expansion of the board of the Australian National Training
Authority by two additional members. Members will recall that the review of the Australian National
Training Authority recommended an expansion of the board by two. That review also recommended the
nature of these two amendments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government does not accept the
recommendation of the review in relation to the character of the parties who should fill these
additional two positions, but the government does believe that it is desirable to expand the
membership of the board. The reason for this is that we see the need within the community to
increase and extend the support for the national training arrangements within the business
community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian National Training Authority is fortunate
to have a very committed board and a board with a diversity of experience in both larger and
smaller enterprises. However, it is also the case that the business community in Australia is very
large and very diverse. We know there are some 700,000 to 800,000 small and medium sized
enterprises in this
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         country and that they play a very
significant role in providing employment and training. Indeed, much of the traditional training
through the apprenticeship system has taken place within the small business sector.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the great difficulties in the representation of such a diverse group of
enterprises is to ensure that there are people on the board who are recognised not only as having
experience in that area—and the board does already contain several members who have that
experience and are widely respected through the small business sector—but people who also
have links into wider business networks. It was recognised by the former government that
appointments to the ANTA board should be on the basis of personal merit. That is a principle which
the government certainly continues to support and regards as being very important. We should not
have members of the board who are purely representatives of organisations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am pleased to acknowledge the fact that Mr Bill Mansfield—a member of the
ACTU who has been a member of the board—has been a highly significant contributor to the
deliberations of the Australian National Training Authority. One of the things that has enabled him
to be a contributor has been his links with the ACTU because they have given him access to a wide
network of representatives.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He is, of course, perhaps limited in his
capacity to represent employees by the fact that a diminishingly small proportion of total
employees is now represented through the ACTU but, taking that into account, we nevertheless
acknowledge the fact that that membership has been valuable. He was not appointed by the ACTU, or
nominated by them as a representative, but appointed in his individual capacity.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="7535" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         It is our intention to make
appointments to these additional two positions to the board of people who are fully justified as
members by the quality of the contribution that they would be able to make to the deliberations of
the Australian National Training Authority. We also intend to take into account, in making these
appointments, the access of these mem bers to the wider networks to which they belong.

        I know that the opposition has some reservations about this. I simply make the
point that the national training framework, represented through the National Training Authority,
was an initiative of the previous government which we believed was worth while and needed to be
built upon. We are making significant reforms to this national training framework, but we would
particularly like to enhance the support and understanding of this activity throughout the business
community and that will be our intention.

         —In speaking to this Vocational Education and
Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill 1996 this afternoon, I would specifically like to refer to the
report of the review of the ANTA agreement. In some ways I find myself in a difficult situation,
and it relates to the fact that in many ways the opposition supports a suggestion that the board of
ANTA ought to be expanded.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our difficulties relate to
the appointments, and I will refer to what the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and
Training (Dr Kemp) just said. He suggested that the people who ought to be appointed are people who
have links with the broader business community. I suggest that is code for the minister to appoint,
on the basis of patronage, people who have links to the government. If anything, I suggest that
might be akin to the appointments recently made, as announced in this House yesterday, to the
Centenary of Federation Council. I believe the issue of vocational education and training ought to
be above petty politics. That is why the ANTA board has been highly successful, despite the fact
that many in the government opposed, in its original sense, the establishment of the board of ANTA
and its objectives.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        How can you take this government on trust? For
example, take the government's appointments to the Centenary of Federation Council. Dick Smith is
to chair the council. That is the type of person whom this government identifies with. Why? Because
he was one of the biggest donors. He was the one who orchestrated a campaign in support of the
election
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of the Howard government. Then we go on. This is the
quality of the people the government likes to appoint. Professor Blainey was appointed, and he is
another political cohort of the minister for schools. Then we have Phoebe Fraser, who is the
daughter of a former Liberal Party Prime Minister.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So I suggest that
it all goes to a question of trust. Our real problem is that we do not trust this government with
respect to the nature of appointments it might make to what we regard as one of the most important
boards that exist, not just at the federal level of government but at all levels of government. It
is not just a federal initiative. It goes to making sure that, at a state and federal level in all
regions of Australia, we have in place a comprehensive policy for vocational education and
training.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In that context, I would like to refer to the fact that
ANTA was established by the Commonwealth—after much debate and with the support of
states—in December of 1992, coming into operation in 1993. In accordance with the
establishment of the board, it was required by the heads of government agreement that a review of
the operations of the board commence. The former government put that review in place in August
1995. It is interesting to note that the review was very much supported by all sections of
Australian industry. Submissions were made by a range of business organisations, individual
employers, government representatives and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister likes to make reference to the question of membership of the
Australian Council of Trade Unions and its affiliates. I will tell you what. We will put up our
record against that of ACCI any day you want because, when you talk about broadly representative
employer organisations, I do not suggest that ACCI is a broadly representative employer
organisation in Australia. As for the BCA, we all know who they represent—the big end of
town. If anything, they have very aggressive policies against the best interests of small business
in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My view is that the government ought to take up the
recommendations of the report of the review of the ANTA agreement. With
        <break page="7536" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         respect to ANTA, I will tell you why it is important that we make sure
we do not politicise the board of ANTA. I agree with the minister. The original appointments were
on the basis of merit. People were required to enter into meetings of the board of ANTA on the
basis that they left their political baggage at the door. Every person who has participated in the
operation of the board of ANTA has risen above their business links, union links or government
links. That is why this government has now decided that the establishment of ANTA was the right
thing and that we ought to go on to strengthen and improve its operations, as suggested in the
report of the review of the ANTA agreement. Where I believe the government is falling short of
embracing the intent of that review is that it is now politicising the appointments.

         —I very
much agree with the appointment by the minister of Mr Julius Rowe, but I point out that Mr Julius
Rowe was appointed on the basis of merit, of his commitment, understanding and involvement in the
question of training. He was not appointed because he was a representative of the Australian
Manufacturing Workers Union, an affiliate of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That goes to
the crux of the problem.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister approached me to
consider this issue last week. The problem was that, in discussing the issue with me, he did not
talk about appointing people on the basis of merit or their understanding, commitment or
involvement in the area of training. He referred in passing to the report of the review of the ANTA
agreement, which recommended that additional people be appointed to the ANTA board. He then talked
about the need to appoint two additional people related to their association with specific
organisations—the BCA and ACCI. That is what he put to me.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I
take the view that ANTA is a success because we have gone out of our way as a nation to ensure that
people who serve on the board of ANTA and are involved in its associated activities serve on the
basis that they are there to do something about improving our skills base and making our system of
training the best possible system in the world. That is why it is a success. They do not go there
as the representative of the ACTU, the BCA, the Commonwealth government, ACCI, the government of
New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or whatever.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         They go there on the basis of the expertise they take into the
workings of that board for the purposes of trying to ensure that we compete as a nation, not on the
basis of lower wages and conditions of employment, as would be the policy adopted by the Minister
for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) if he were the Prime Minister of Australia. They are there on
the basis of ensuring that we com pete internationally with respect to the skilling of the
Australian work force. That is why we are concerned, because it was the minister himself who raised
the possibility of the two additional people being direct representatives of ACCI and the
BCA.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I did not put those words into the minister's mouth; he
referred to those people who are related to the operations of the BCA and ACCI in his discussion
with me. For example, he did not specifically refer to the recommendations which are set out in the
review of ANTA's activities. The review proposes that the appointments to the board be the
Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education and Training; a senior state or territory
official; and, desirably, the Chairperson of the Standards and Curriculum Council—and I
acknowledge that the Standards and Curriculum Council has been abolished.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, the real issue comes back to the minister's credibility. Obviously,
while we stand in opposition, the government will win the day. It is then a question of whether
this government is prepared to adopt the policy approach of the previous government to ensure that
the appointments made are not made on the basis of taking the baggage from where they come into the
operations of ANTA. In speaking today, I challenge the minister, when selecting the additional
people, to go out of his way to ensure that they are not there to sing the song of the BCA or
ACCI.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would also say in passing that I believe that would be in
accordance with the thrust of the policy position adopted by state governments, especially Liberal
state governments, when ANTA was first established in 1992. That was the policy position accepted
by the Commonwealth government after comprehensive discussion with state governments, especially
Liberal state governments. They wanted to ensure that, if we were prepared to try and test a new
approach to vocational education and training, it rose above politics. My fear is that, because of
the nature of appointments that have been made by this government in a range of areas since the
election of 2 March, we might take vocational education and training back to the murky days

given the unusual intervention by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) which has just
occurred. He is a new member in the chamber, and he sees fit not only to refer to a private
conversation that we had but, indeed, to misrepresent it. I will certainly take that into account

        At no stage did I say that
particular people would have to be appointed as representatives of the two organisations he has
mentioned. I instanced those two organisations, and I mentioned the name of a particular
person—whom so far he has refrained from mentioning—as being the kind of person whom we
might appoint. I had expected him to understand quite clearly what was being said. But I gathered,
as the conversation went on, that he really was quite out of his depth in this area, because he
said, `Well, I'm not sure about all of that; I'll have to talk to Kim about it.' I had always
thought the President of the ACTU was the expert in all these matters. But the shadow minister for
employment and training had to take it up with the leader, apparently, before he could understand
what was being said by me—and that related, of course, to an initiative of the former
government.

        It just beggars the imagination to think that the Labor
Party would be at all concerned that a government of the day might appoint people who were closely
linked to it, when one considers the incredible number of appointments made by the Labor Party of
members and officers of the ACTU. Indeed, so overboard did they go in appointing their union mates
to bodies—from the National Training Authority, to the industry training advisory bodies,
right down through the training system—and so keen were they to promote their friends who, of
course, contributed enormous sums of money to the Labor Party
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        Because of this extraordinary behaviour in relation to the
training initiatives of the former Labor government, business was naturally very suspicious. That
is one of the reasons why for 10 years the Labor Party failed to get up public support for the
traineeship concept. Back in 1985, figures of 75,000 trainees a year were used; by the end of the
Labor period in 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a
proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. One of the reasons for that, Mr
Deputy Speaker, and Shadow Minister across the table, is that so many small businesses who did not
have unionised workshops were terrified that, if they took on a trainee, that trainee would bring
in his or her wake the union supervisor. They placed the training system under such intense union
supervision that they frightened off the very people who might hire the trainees and
apprentices.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is why for 10 years they were unable to make the
system work. It was not that they did not have some good ideas; they did have some good ideas. It
was not that there were not clever people thinking through the system. It was just that they could
never make it work because their whole approach was one of constant promotion of their mates in the
union movement of whom they are the political voices, the constant promotion of the major
contributors to Labor Party funds.

        They put their own narrow
partisan interests ahead of the interests of young Australians and the national interest, just as
they are doing in this debate. That is why we are seeing the absurd contributions from the other
side the House on an amendment with which they actually agree—and it does them no credit
whatever.

        But
this is not in any way what the government is seeking to achieve. The Minister for Schools,
Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has made it quite clear that the two extra appointees
will be from the business community and the business community only—specifically, appointees
acceptable to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of
Australia—which is a far cry from the recommendations contained in the ANTA review. The ANTA
review stated in this regard:

        As a former member of the council of the Casey College of TAFE, one of the
largest TAFE facilities within my electorate of Isaacs, I know that imperative to the operation of
these organisations is balance. On that particular council, of which I was an active member, there
were representatives from trade unions, from business organisations, from small business and from
academia. We interacted and exchanged information, and that of course was to the long-term benefit
of the Casey College of TAFE. The fact that we had that diversity of backgrounds was an integral
component of the business plans that we developed for it.

         I might remind Minister Kemp, the underling of Minister
Vanstone, of what Minister Vanstone said in the estimates committee about what industry domination
of these bodies meant to this government. The minister said that she meant specifically excluding
workers' representatives from the vocational education and training sector. She understood business
to mean the owners of business, the owners of capital, not the person or persons who made capital
productive—that is, the workers in industry. She quite consciously and quite deliberately set
forth the government's position that was founded on this very premise. In fact, I refer Minister
Kemp to his superior's comments before that estimates committee.

         The
opposition is opposed to this proposition. The major policy reversal that the government is
pursuing through this bill contradicts its push to put more employer representatives on ANTA and
contradicts the various points that it made prior to its election about broader consultation in the
area of education and training. That is apparent at every level. The operating budget cut of some
25 per cent to ANTA head office will see the removal of many and varied positions. The level of
service will have to fall.

         The abolition of pre&amp;hyphen;vocational
programs, or at least their reduced funding for access, will have a detrimental impact on training
schemes in my state of Victoria. There will be a requirement that labour market programs themselves
will decline as a result of this budget measure which will have, as I say, a particularly
detrimental impact in Victoria. For example, labour market programs in that state will decline to
the tune of some $80 million per annum. I make reference to the funding of TAFE institutes in
Victoria. There will be a significant reduction in residual labour market funds to support training
for a number of apprentices as part of the new MAATS scheme. There will be new tendering
arrangements for labour market programs which will also impact on the provision of services within
Victoria and TAFE institutions such as that which I am already involved with, the Casey College of
TAFE.

expertise, commitment and the contribution they would make rather than as representatives of
particular interest groups. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said, and it alerted me to
some difficulties with the suggestion by the minister.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister
was the one who raised in the conversation with me the fact that he was looking to appoint people
who had links with ACCI and the Business Council of Australia. Those people should not be the types
of people appointed to the board of ANTA. The types of people who should be appointed to the board
are representatives of the business community who are vitally concerned on a day-to-day basis with
implementing decent and forward&amp;hyphen;looking vocational education and training initiatives. They
should not be people who are there as representatives of particular organisations, be it the ACTU,
the MTIA, the MBA, ACCI or the BCA.

        That was the basis of the
establishment of ANTA and that is why it is now a success. That is why the current government has
changed its approach to ANTA, and that is why the current government has finally decided, despite
its original vigorous opposition to the establishment of ANTA, to support its continued operation.
So the test for the minister is really whether or not, in considering the additional appointments,
he is prepared—unlike other ministers of this current government—to rise above politics
and ensure that the people appointed are appointed on the basis of merit.

         —When
the debate was adjourned last evening, I was speaking about the circumstances of those Australians
who will be unable to exercise the right that most of us would take for granted—that is, to
marry a person of their choice and to live in this country with that partner of their
choice—as a consequence of this government's determination in this migration legislation to
establish the power to set limits to the numbers of husbands and wives that can be allowed to enter
the country in any one year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Similarly, the right to
meet our responsibility for caring for elderly parents is one which, until now, we have quite
rightly accepted and regarded as an important element of any
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         immigration program. But this bill provides a power in the minister to also limit and cap the
number of such parents that will come to this country.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Minister
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) wants to be able to say to some
Australians—citizens or permanent residents alike—if their parents happen to live
overseas, `Even if you meet all the restrictive visa qualifications, even if you meet the tests
that are set down in the regulations, you will not necessarily be able to come.' Those who do miss
out will not necessarily be able to go in some form of queue. They will simply be asked to try
again next year. They could miss out again and again because there is no necessity in this
legislation to give any priority to those who have waited for an extended period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Meanwhile, the elderly parent, for whom the person living in this country would
have a sense of responsibility, is asked to wait patiently, to go on hold for another year and not
be anxious about the lottery that is being played with their lives. As a personal reflection, I
regard the responsibility of caring for one's elderly parents as nothing particularly out of the
ordinary. My own family undertook that responsibility in the case of my grandfather, who came from
Scotland to live in Australia with us in a small flat associated with our home. I would have
thought that that sense of responsibility would be one which would commend itself to a party that
holds itself out as being committed to the rights of Australian families. But this legislation
actually intrudes into these very fundamental areas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What the bill
seeks to do in the case of dependent children is equally unthinkable. Many scenarios would arise
year after year where a parent in Australia would be unable to have their dependent child or
children in their care. If this legislation is passed, cases could exist, for example, involving
broken marriages and cases where the child may be the subject of abuse with one parent overseas and
one parent in Australia unable to bring that child to this country to care for their child simply
because the minister has set a maximum number of dependent children—from infants to those who
are nearing the end
        <break page="7546" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of their school days—who
can be sponsored and because the magic number that the minister has set has been reached.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These scenarios are not hypothetical. The case of baby Samuel that I
referred to earlier is just a foreshadow of what is likely to occur, repeated hundreds of times
over. In that instance there was an infant child and the woman's fiance was living in England. She
could bring the baby under the existing rules but not the baby's father. So the family was being
torn apart. These regulations take that further. They make it worse. She will not even be able to
bring the baby—an infant child—to this country if the minister sets a cap and imposes
that cap as permitted in this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Are these proposals
acceptable? I need to quote no person other than the present Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs to give support to my profound objection to these aspects of the bill. In
June 1989, when the current provisions in the bill were inserted, which allow capping of most
elements of the immigration program but not those immediate family elements, the then opposition
spokesperson, Mr Ruddock, now the minister, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I regard it as
absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, `We have enough
spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come
to Australia—no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am
glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet in his
second reading speech on this bill, the minister, referring to the issue of capping, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is crucial to restoring public confidence in the immigration program,
which had been greatly eroded under Labor.
       </para>
       <para>
        He also said that Labor had allowed
immigration to get seriously out of control. It is utterly deceitful and irresponsible for the
minister to say this. By saying this, he helps to fuel an anti-immigration sentiment in the
community. He knows that what he is saying is not true. He knows that measures are now in place to
allow scrutiny of the veracity and the legitimacy of relationships. Today this opposition has
agreed with processes which
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         will proceed in the Senate to
have a two-year probationary visa for any new marriages. So if there is any insincerity or any sham
in relation to a marriage, that can be dealt with effectively.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This
bill moves beyond any legitimate application of government power into the direct family area and
acts in a way to hold husband and wife apart, husband and child apart and mother and child apart
and not to allow families to give any care or responsibility to their elderly parents. This is an
unthinkable measure. As the minister said in opposition, `I regard it as absolutely
unconscionable.' Where is the now minister's conscience?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The truth
is that these are not the minister's proposals. The truth is that the minister would now reject
measures of this nature were he given personal licence to do so. But he has become a cipher. He has
become the Philip Demidenko of the Australian political system. He is simply the hand that signs
the paper, putting forward proposals that have come down as edicts from a Prime Minister (Mr
Howard) who is running a sham and a phoney campaign, playing to the basest sentiments of some in
the community and using as his cat's paw a man who once had a reputation for honour and integrity
in this area. Philip `Demidenko' Ruddock is the Australian minister for immigration, the hand that
signs the paper, the cat's paw for the Prime Minister, the person who is talking code in order to
take base political advantage, where he himself has a conscience which I am certain is offended
mightily by what is being done.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The measures that have come forward
are not necessary at all to ensure a lower immigration program. In fact, two of the last three
years of the Keating Labor government saw programs substantially lower than that which is now being
put forward by the current government. In 1992-93 the total program was 67,900, in 1993-94 the
total program was 62,800 and the planning level for this year is 74,000. It is not necessary to
attack family rights in order to bring lower immigration. There is a complete capacity in the hands
of this government to bring in an immigration
        <break page="7547" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         program not only at the target level that they set but some 15,000 lower than the target they set
without the slightest need to introduce draconian measures of this nature. This is irresponsible
and socially destructive policy making.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another point I would make,
and it is important, is that any loss of confidence in the migration program has far more to do
with irresponsible perpetuation of myths than with the program having gone out of control. Myths
that are being perpetuated by this government suggest that new arrivals somehow leech on the back
of Australian taxpayers. There are suggestions that measures of this nature are necessary because
of sham marriages and that the opposition is somehow resisting control measures about sham
marriages. The myths that are being perpetuated and fed to the community are doing that damage and
doing it daily.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We need to speak up in a factual and balanced way,
not to implement policies of this nature which are destructive socially to the fabric of this
country. If I happen to be travelling overseas on a working holiday and meet a Dutch, Italian,
Greek, Japanese or English girl and form an affection for her and wish to marry, what part is it of
my government to say that I cannot bring my partner to this country and form my family here? More
so, if I have had a child by that person, what part is it of this Australian government to say that
my child cannot come to my country and be part of my family?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        How
irresponsible it is to have a government that is saying that at a fixed point, at any one period in
a year, there will be no more such applications. If there is any area that should have absolute
priority, it is the right of Australians to have with them their husbands and wives and their
dependent children. The cruelty of any counter&amp;hyphen;proposition should be self&amp;hyphen;evident.
And it was to the then opposition spokesperson. It certainly is to me now. And it certainly is to
this opposition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another unacceptable change in this bill is that it
seeks to implement a legislative exemption of the Sex Discrimination Act to the Migration Act of
1958. That is to allow the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         minister to prescribe a
two&amp;hyphen;year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependent or same sex
relationships.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We see it as deplorable that the government seeks to
implement such legislative amendment in order to mete out especially harsh treatment to de facto
spouses and interdependent couples. This amounts to imposing by legislation moral values which
ignore contemporary views and restrict freedom of choice to a degree which will virtually end the
utility of these visa categories.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I might say, in the spirit of some
cooperation with the government, that I have indicated to the minister that, were he to come back
to us with some proposal for a shorter period, we may well be disposed to look at that. But thus
far, there has been no approach. There is a determination to press ahead with a two&amp;hyphen;year
cohabitation period before you can consider a person under this program.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition sees no reason for treating these relatively small numbers of
applicants with less trust than spouse applicants. We believe that a stricter pre&amp;hyphen;screening
process, which we have given the tick to, and a two&amp;hyphen;year provisional visa, as would apply to
spouse applications, would be a proper check. We have supported the government's measures to
toughen up compliance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also make the point that, at least with
respect to some of the interdependent visa categories, there are circumstances in some societies
which are actively intolerant where physical cohabitation between two persons under the
interdependency category is not going to be established without possible physical and serious risk
to those persons. These are measures which do have serious implications.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One other measure that we oppose is the introduction of the Migration (Visa
Application) Charge Bill. In itself, it is relatively innocuous. It seeks to roll all of the
existing migration charges into one—the visa application fee, which the government is
increasing by over 200 per cent; the English education charge, which is going up nearly 250 per
cent; and the health services charge, which is to be applied to the whole of the preferential
        <break page="7548" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         family category without any rationale to support
widening its application.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have accepted the government's increase
in most of those charges, but not to the English education charge. The reason is that learning
English is very much part of the settlement process. It is vital for arrivals who have been granted
the right to make this country their home, under the claim of a non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory policy,
to learn English. It was called `the glue of a cohesive nation' in the coalition's own policy
statement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To raise the charge to $5,500 per person will make it
unaffordable to many. This would plainly be discriminatory against non&amp;hyphen;English speaking
applicants and not, in the code language of the minister, `selective'. It is in the national
interest that new arrivals learn English. They are more likely to become productive members of this
society. The coalition is ill advised to have taken that measure. Whilst the rolling into one
charge of all these measures is not in itself an objectionable matter, because it incorporates an
objectionable measure we will not support the schedule to the bill which allows for that to
occur.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I should indicate that the opposition has accepted the
controversial visa application fee rise. As it is not possible to extract the English education
charge and oppose it alone in this bill, whilst our objection is only to one&amp;hyphen;tenth of that
measure, the minister has again, in his failure to accept an offer of cooperation, refused to
separate the charges.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The new charge in this bill is simply
expressed as a maximum of $12,500 per year, and it makes no distinction between primary and
secondary applicants. In other words, a family of four could face, under this bill, a total fee of
$50,000 in order to migrate to Australia. That is a pretty `selective' measure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With respect to the provisions regarding the stripping of persons of their
citizenship for matters that go to their application for entry or citizenship to this country, we
accept that the government is addressing a matter about which many Australians may have legitimate
concerns. We welcome the supplementary explanatory memorandum that the minister has tabled and
brought forward at our request.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         It clarifies that the
government means in its action that there must be intent to defraud before an action can be
taken.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, we raise a concern that I think will have to be
addressed by the minister, which is the question of statelessness. There are conventions in place
internationally to avoid persons becoming stateless. Somebody who has, by acceptance of an
Australian citizenship, found himself or herself without the citizenship of their former country of
residence could lose Australian citizenship under these provisions perhaps 20 or 30 years later.
These matters plainly need to be looked at. In that circumstance, I certainly ask the minister to
come back to the parliament and address this issue when it goes before the Senate, because the
Senate has established a committee to look at the whole of this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In conclusion, these measures are not necessary for an orderly migration program.
They are also cruel. In the language of the then opposition spokesperson and now minister, they are
unconscionable measures. They are being driven not by his agenda but by others. It is unworthy of

         —I have
reflected on the request by the honourable member for Charlton during question time this afternoon
that the Minister for Industrial Relations withdraw remarks which the honourable member found
offensive. I have previously ruled that there was nothing disorderly in the comments made by the
minister, and a careful analysis of his remarks does not provide any basis on which to rule that
they were offensive. Therefore, I conclude that there is no requirement for the minister to
withdraw any of his remarks.

had asked the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to withdraw on two occasions. You asked him to
withdraw on the first occasion, having required him to reflect on the statement and withdraw. I
think at the subsequent stage—I have not got the precise words in front of me—to the
extent to which you said that the honourable member for Charlton found them offensive, you then
repeated the request for withdrawal. I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that in that context, because
you had accepted that the honourable member for Charlton had found them offensive, that was
sufficient for you to accept the offensive nature of the remarks. You specifically required the
Leader of the House on the second occasion to withdraw. I ask you to again look at the record of
what you said in asking him to withdraw and to hold to that view.

remarks. As I said, I have had an opportunity to reflect not only on the words used by the Minister
for Industrial Relations and the honourable member for Charlton but also on my own words on this
matter. Indeed, out of respect for the honourable member for Charlton, whose behaviour generally in
this House is exemplary, I thought there must have been a nuance within the remarks made by the
Minister for Industrial Relations that had escaped me, given the general furore that was going on
in the parliament at the time. We have alluded to that separately and I will not go on with
it.

         If any
ruling made today was an error of judgment, the principal error is mine. The second one is that of
the honourable member for Charlton, whose previous behaviour in this House, as I say, has been
exemplary. However, a definitive reading of the remarks made by the minister does not under any
circumstances portray to me, in the independent role that I try to maintain in this House, any
offence, either disorderly or offensive. I looked at offensiveness in two particular arenas:
personal offence to the honourable member for Charlton, and political offence to the honourable
member for Charlton. On either ground, I ruled that no offensive re marks were made by the Minister
for Industrial Relations.

linking—`we' being the government—the Australian Labor Party with the ACTU and
recognising that there are two former presidents of the ACTU on the front bench of the opposition,
there was nothing offensive. I would see that, in the normal course of events, as being robust
political debate but certainly not offensive debate.

and the Labor Party. I am not deliberately misrepresenting his position, but the clear implication
to me was that the Labor Party had by omission failed to object to that action by the ACTU and so,
to that extent at least, the Labor Party was also guilty. I took exception to that. The
implication, to my mind, was that the Labor Party, by failing to oppose that behaviour, had in
effect condoned the action being taken against

offensive. I still find it grossly offensive. Quite clearly, while the Minister for Industrial
Relations may deny it, it was his intention to establish a connection between the Labor Party, of
which I am a proud member, and the ACTU over that question. I believe that the Minister for
Industrial Relations realised that he went too far.

where a collective claim is made against a group of people, that claim is also made against each

offence and to seek redress. Mr Speaker, of course it was on that that I sought redress from

attempt that was made, in my mind, by the Minister for Industrial Relations to establish a
connection between myself and my colleagues—Her Majesty's opposition in this national
parliament—in condoning, by failing to sufficiently oppose, some type of offence against
women. I serve notice on that man and anyone else that if such an attempt is made in future to
suggest that I, as a member of any other group, would be guilty of such, I will be much less
tolerant.

         Speaker, on indulgence, obviously in the heat of question time things are said,

The fact is that the member for Charlton, as I am reliably informed, was not even here when I

       If I may, I will speak very briefly to
the motion—and I will be brief so as not to encourage the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr
Crean) to give us yet another rhetorical display to make his mark as his leadership campaign
gathers momentum. The week commencing 9 December is essentially an additional week for the
parliament to sit. When we were thinking of the program some weeks ago, we were hoping we would be
able to get away with sitting on the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the last week to coincide
with the final sitting in the Senate—also, of course, on Friday, 13 December.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The reason we need to sit until the conclusion of matters in the Senate is that,
in the event that there are bills to come back from the Senate, the House of Representatives needs
to sit so that those matters can be concluded prior to Christmas. With the very heavy legislative
program of the reformist Howard government in its first year, obviously there are potentially a
number of matters to be dealt with.
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since that first evaluation, it has become clear that in the House of
Representatives there will also be a fairly significant workload. We therefore decided to sit on
the Monday and Tuesday of the week commencing 9 December as well. So as to give priority to
government business, we came to the view that we should sit on that Monday, with sitting hours and
routine of business applying as normal from Monday to Thursday, but with the exception that on the
Monday there will be government business only with question time at 2 o'clock. This will ensure
that we use the time to get through as much government business as possible.

to the occasion, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) gets 10 out of 10 for hypocrisy. This was the
person who was going to raise the standards. This was the person who was going to give more
accountability to parliament and more question time, but here we have another example of where he
squibs it. I have two issues that I want to raise. One is the question of a question time on Friday
of next week, given that we are sitting. Given his hopeless management of the House, we are sitting
all of next week—five days. When I had the discussion with him over the phone and he told me

Leader of the House had with me over the phone in proposing that we would have to meet on Monday
and Tuesday of next week. What he said to me was that he proposed to meet on Monday and Tuesday
essentially to deal, on a priority basis, with government business, that non&amp;hyphen;government
business may be able to be slotted in later in the week—Wednesday and Thursday—as
fillers, but we would be around on Friday because we would still be waiting for issues from the
Senate. My first question to the Leader of the House was, `Have we got five question times?' and
the answer was, `Yes, of course.'

        An opportunity goes begging on Friday, and he will not allow it. It is
political cowardice. It is double standards. It is hypocrisy. This is the man who said that they
were going to lift the standards. They cannot rely on the argument that we did it when, in fact, we
did allow question time. He cannot rely on that, because he said and the government said and the
Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that they were going to lift the standards. What sheer and utter
hypocrisy. The Prime Minister's much vaunted but infrequently honoured commitment to raise the
standards of this parliament has been so often breached that you run out of pages listing these
things.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I would not be surprised if the government opposes this
amendment. What we will be doing is just highlighting to your backbench the hypocrisy and the
hopelessness of the way in which this man, the Leader of the House, handles the place. We are in a
shambles. He breaks deals, does not honour conventions and says they are going to be more
accountable. He is a person who could not manage a chook raffle. He can manage the special deal on
the penthouse, but he cannot manage the affairs of this parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since coming to government, they have shown nothing but contempt for the
standards of this parliament. Just understand this: he imposed a time limit on the consideration of
the workplace relations bill. Whenever we wanted to get to the detail of this bill, he imposed a
gag. More accountability, but the gag.

           —Madam
Deputy Speaker, I do appreciate your consideration on this important matter. My point of order is
very simple; that is, that the member for Hotham is now discussing the passage of the workplace
relations bill. That matter is irrelevant to the motion before the chair and the amendment to the
motion moved by the member for Hotham. Under no possible circumstances could the passage and
handling of the workplace relations bill be relevant to the matter currently before the chair. I
invite you to rule accordingly. I appreciate that the member for Hotham, desperate for an argument,
has ranged very widely in his presentation tonight, but my point of order is that he should be
invited to stick to the matters before the chair.

undertakings to us and this is but one of them. The reason we need question time on Friday is that
the circumstances that have surrounded the way in which they have gagged other debates require us
to hold them accountable through question time. That is the whole point of alluding to these

         The Federal Airports Corporation, on behalf of the state and federal governments, proposes to

         The runway extension will provide the

necessary for facilitating tourism and the export of produce and products from South Australia and,
thus, the economic growth of the state. The estimated outturn cost is $48 million. It is
anticipated that the construction will start in March 1997 and be completed by November 1998. I

committee has duly reported to Parliament: CSIRO Research Interaction Centre and Biomolecular
Research Facilities, Black Mountain, ACT.

          CSIRO proposes to demolish existing
laboratory facilities which are seriously substandard and very much outdated and to redevelop the
site to construct a high&amp;hyphen;quality research laboratory to meet the Division of Plant
Industry's requirements for biological research into the 21st century.

          The proposal will allow the CSIRO to increase its capacity to communicate the
results of its research, not only for the benefit of the industries that it serves but also as a
service to the Australian community. It is therefore planned to incorporate the Division of Plant
Industry laboratory into a CSIRO Research Interaction Centre to enhance the organisation's image in
the community at large. It is intended that this complex will bring the concepts and achievements
of CSIRO's research to the community and provide programs that will enable special groups and CSIRO
stakeholders to share in the excitement of new scientific discoveries.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The proposed CSIRO Research Interaction Centre, which is to be integrated with
the laboratory wing, will offer interactive exhibits illustrating CSIRO research and its
applications in the community. The centre will be substantially self&amp;hyphen;funding in its
operation and it is intended to provide a powerful statement about CSIRO's commitment to inform the
public of its research and, in turn, inspire long-term interest in and support for the
CSIRO.

          The CSIRO Black Mountain site is lacking in amenity
facilities for the use of its staff. It is proposed to overcome this deficiency with the
incorporation of cafeteria, conference and banking facilities in the complex. The Public Works
Committee tabled their report on 19 November 1996, recommending the project at an estimated outturn
cost of $17.1 million. In their report, the committee recommended the construction of the CSIRO
Research Interaction Centre and Biomolecular Research

          CSIRO has noted the committee's recommendations and will review the design of the

current project budget. If approved, the project is planned for completion by the end of 1998. I
would like to thank the committee for their report. I commend the motion to the House.

        I will
make some brief points on these matters. The amendments were designed to amend the commencement
provisions of the bill to take account of the fact that the bill did not receive royal assent prior
to specific dates and to make some consequential amendments and other machinery provisions to take
account of the fact that the bill did not receive passage earlier.

        Amendment 4 proposes to insert an application clause into the bill, purportedly
to remove any doubt as to whom the waiting period will not apply to. Amendment 5 concerns the
effect of the Racial Discrimination Act and proposes to insert a clause into the bill to indicate
that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act are to prevail over the amending act. The
government does not oppose this amendment. However, in doing so it wants to note that it does not
consider the amending act ever was or is in conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act.

        To that end, it is noted that the evidence of Professor Ivan Shearer and
the Attorney-General's Department given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee
was that the bill does not discriminate on the grounds of race or contravene international
obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This
position was adopted by the majority of that committee.

        Amendment 6
is a consequential amendment, government instigated, resulting from changes made in amendment No.
1. Amendment 7—relating to the day on which a permanent visa is to be taken to have been
granted for the purpose of a newly arrived resident's waiting period—provides a newly arrived
resident's waiting period for a person who is granted a permanent visa in Australia after having
appealed. An initial decision to grant that visa is to commence from the date of the initial
decision. The amendment was made to give effect to recommendation 7 of the majority report of the
Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.

        Amendment 8 is
another government instigated amendment. The government always envisaged the guidelines would be
issued to assist delegates in determining who
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         should be
treated as a family member for the purposes of this act. The amendment inserts a new subsection
that provides that the minister may, by determination in writing, set guidelines for the exercise
of the secretary's power and that the guidelines may be revoked and may vary.

        Amendment 9 relates to the definition of the newly arrived resident's waiting
period. Again, it was government instigated. The amendment removes the reference to a jobsearch
allowance relating to a newly arrived resident's waiting period as it is no longer necessary given
that the jobsearch allowance was abolished. There are some like matters, but they are largely
issues that arose out of government amendments giving effect to those matters which it had acceded
to as a result of the Senate committee's deliberations and technical and consequential
amendments.

         —The opposition supports this group of amendments to the Social Security
Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill. They can
be conveniently classed in two groups. The first reflect a recognition by the government that it
failed to get its legislation before the parliament in sufficient time to bring into effect the
legislation on the dates it had intended to bring it in. That is, aside from any question of
retrospectivity, the government did not bring the bill into the House nor give it sufficient
priority in the Senate so that it could be dealt with before the dates set in the bill acted as
commencement dates. So there obviously needed to be changes in the legislation to cover that
contingency.

        What I find particularly ironic about this
is the spurious alleged savings that are now said to have been lost to the government by reason of
the Senate's decision. Senator Newman claimed $124.9 million would be lost primarily because of a
change in the start date from 1 April 1996 to the date of royal assent, which we can conveniently
assume would be intended to be early in the new year now. So the government is blaming the Senate
for the coalition's failure, first, to recall the parliament before 30 April this year and, second,
to
        <break page="7562" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

last week.

        It is an extraordinary proposition that $125 million in
alleged lost savings are now being attributed by the minister to actions in the Senate when the
bill was not brought before the Senate in time to come into effect on the dates the bill itself
said would be the dates of its commencement. We have this extraordinarily phoney campaign that has
been run in the community—again, unworthily by this government—on the basis of the
government positioning itself to take advantage of a sentiment that it knows to exist in the
community and of asserting that the Senate and the non-government parties have acted in an
irresponsible manner. But it failed to give priority to this legislation either in this House or in
the Senate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's own legislation could not have come
into effect on the dates that it set out in its legislation because of that fact, so it has to move
consequential amendments, which we are now asked to agree to, so that the legislation can come into
effect at a time in the future. It claims that lost savings of $125 million will be the consequence
of that. I do not think I have heard anything so fanciful in my life. It is a most extraordinary
circumstance. When one finds that we have had threats of a double dissolution and suggestions that
Australian taxpayers are going to have to foot higher taxes as a result of this action, what one
really finds is that it is the government's own failure to bring this legislation before this
parliament in a timely way so that the matters could be dealt with.

         —I
will be very brief. It is important to put on record that the Senate now operates with a series of
committees and it operates with priorities and cut-off dates. The system is that legislation
introduced in one session is not finalised until the next session, with that option being
overridden if the Senate so chooses. This was designed last year by the current government and the
Australian Democrats. They established the system that has been operating since then. It is within
this system that they have put forward this legislation as well as all the other legislation. They
designed the system that is now operating.

        When we
listen to what the minister is saying, we get the impression that the opposition has more senators
than the government. The fact is that the government have something like 10 senators more than the
opposition in the Senate, yet they are somehow saying that we dictate in this matter. It is
important to realise that the process is in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         place. There are
cut-off periods, and matters are dealt with in the next session unless prioritised and agreed to.
The committee structures established are now chaired by particular parts of the Senate. This system
was established by the government and the Democrats last year, not by us. It was opposed by us at
the time. However, it is their system which they are now criticising.

to deceive the public at large here tonight about the Senate processes, how can we trust anything
they say? How could anybody trust anything that this minister says about any of this legislation if
he tries to mislead the community at large over a Senate system that he helped design? The
government set it up and boasted far and wide about what a massive and wonderful improvement they
had made to the Senate. They are now talking about the improvement they made last year. My, my, how
times and positions have changed. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is important the people understand
that the Senate we are talking about is the system the government designed.

        As the minister rightly pointed out, this legislation has been in the hands of
the Senate for something like six months. The government demonstrated what priority it gave to this
matter by passing it in the very first sittings of the new parliament. Within days of the election,
this government had the legislation before this parliament. It was sent to the Senate before we
broke on the first occasion. So there has indeed been a degree of urgency given to this priority
issue. This election promise by the coalition government was given priority and sent to the Senate
as quickly as possible. It has now taken from the end of May through until early December to return
it to this House. Inevitably, this delay has affected the proposed start-up date for the
legislation.

would also like to refer briefly to a comment by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) which left me

these matters would lead to tax increases. Has the Labor Party learnt nothing from its 13 years in
government, when it spent money it did not have. Many of these measures would not have even been
necessary if you had not delivered to us a $10.3 billion budget deficit to start with.

savings measures, it has an impact on both sides of the budget. We have one or two alternatives. We
can increase the deficit—that is Labor's solution. We can borrow from somebody else so that
we can pay benefits to migrants coming into this country. We can borrow other people's money and
continue to live beyond our means. Sadly, the other option—the honourable member for Denison

more revenue.

form, interfere with the Racial Discrimination Act. After consideration of this bill by that Senate
committee, the bill was referred back to this House on 30 September. It took the

specific provisions that would make allowance for changed circumstances after arrival.

        The opposition, as it then was, specifically envisaged that there might well be
circumstances where the person who had given assurances of support had died or lost their job.
There were a range of other circumstances that the government picked up in the Social Security

were designed to specifically acknowledge that, when changed circumstances arose, they would be
able to be taken into account.

         The government certainly had in mind, in relation to access to benefits, that those
people who came through the business migration program or the employer nomination program and
independent entrants ought to have sufficient funds to be able to provide for themselves after
arrival in Australia. Those who came through the family reunion program ought to be the subject of
sponsorship which was intended to be real. These were the people for whom the shadow minister, when
he has spoken, has made the point in other circumstances that they could be the villains in the
piece, if they want to walk away from their obligations. He commit ted the opposition to wanting to
make those sponsors pay those obligations. They were the sorts of words he used on the Hinch

        The fact is that we know—and we have made this point

languish. It had been the subject of very few changes. We know from answers to questions in another
place at different times—by Senator Richardson in particular—that the recoveries of
moneys that were guaranteed under assurances were not possible. It was for this reason that the
government made it clear before the election that it would be moving in this direction.

        You only have to read the documents that we put out at the time. It was
quite clear that it was to be extended to the full range of benefits, except those that were
specifically identified and for which we have not sought, in this legislation, such coverage. That
was the background to the measure. These were not, in our view, unreasonable measures. If people
are given an opportunity to obtain places in Australia in preference to others on the basis of
assurances that they will not become a charge upon the general community, it is our view that those
assurances ought to be honoured. The way in which you can ensure that they are honoured—when
you look at the failure in the past—is to have a preclusion period. My time is almost passed,
but, no doubt, in the context of the debate that will ensue, I will have an opportunity to add some

migration policy and settlement policy. One of those documents was directed towards settlement
policy specifically. With respect to settlement policy, what the coalition did was to say that it

        The fact is that these are
responsible measures. They add to Australia's savings, because we do not have to continue to borrow
money overseas, which is really what we are doing. We have migrants in Australia who are unable to
support themselves. They get on the gravy train—I am talking about a small percentage of
them, but it does happen. It is costing us millions of dollars to support them—money which
comes from one of two places: out of further borrowings or out of the pockets of Australian
workers. If they are the policies that you support and continue to support, you will continue to
sit on that side of the chamber for many years to come.

          Meeting our

         </emphasis>
         document, plainly, people had a discussion about what it meant and how it
was consistent with what the coalition had said by way of its more general policy statements. What
occurred, of course, was that there were discussions and comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)
in explaining it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What you have is this situation. The
claim for a mandate, the claim that there is some authority flowing from this election, comes down
to in the end what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) said yesterday in defending
her exaggerated claims for lost savings from this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly
Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. What she said there is that the
reason you knew the government must have intended this is that, if we were to sit down and analyse
the figures in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Meeting our commitment
        </emphasis>
        , we would have started
to think about where those extra savings were to be found.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="7573" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         So the conclusion is this. This is where the mandate comes
from. The wise Australian voter, in considering what the coalition had promised, was intended to do
this: he was in tended to know that the coalition was going to move beyond unemployment benefits
and sickness benefits and the benefits that were subject to the six-month waiting period already,
and he was intended to have had the wisdom to know that the written statement in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Meeting our commitments
         </emphasis>
         , that `Full access to family allowance will be
maintained' must have been a non-core promise.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, they must
have had the insight to know that when the now Prime Minister clarified his proposal by saying, `It
of course doesn't apply to family allowance and other benefits,' he meant the direct opposite. They
must have also had the resources of the finance department to work out that the $616 million
savings projected in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Meeting our commitments
        </emphasis>
        could not have
been achieved by extending the six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period to two years and then must have had
the wisdom after that to conclude therefore that the coalition actually had a secret plan for which
they would now claim a mandate after the election to introduce a two-year waiting period for all
the measures which they had said they had no intention of applying the two-year period to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not surprising that no commentator actually reached that conclusion.
There was a large debate about whether the costings of these measures were accurate. Peter Costello
said publicly that what was being done was simply extending Labor's six months to two years but
said that those savings would be achieved. So the basis of the so-called mandate is that you must
believe that the Prime Minister was a liar, you must believe that the Treasurer was a liar, you
must believe that what they said in their own
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Meeting our
commitments
        </emphasis>
        document was false in so far as it said that it would not apply to family
allowance, you must believe that they were not intending to apply any consistency with their
previously published documents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Now what we have is the real voice
of the coalition in government—misleading and deceitful, because where these measures come in
are not in terms of income support benefits. Income support benefits have been dealt with as were
projected by the coalition. When I went into the shadow ministry I said, `I don't
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         like this. I think we got the balance right', but the coalition went
to the people and said, `We are extending the six&amp;hyphen;month period to two years. We thought we
had the balance right but we will allow this burdensome measure to come in so that new migrants
cannot get unemployment benefits, cannot get sickness benefits, and cannot get youth training
support for those periods of times.'
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But if you are a working
Australian, paying your taxes, with kids to support, then you should get family allowance—the
sorts of things the coalition said you would before the election. They are not going to be able to
cheat people out of what are normal non-discriminatory benefits available to every person who has a
family and works in this country just because they are targeting you as a migrant, just because
they are seeking to play on these crude sensibilities that are run out there in the community. I am
very angry that this debate has been so distorted by the coalition.

make a contribution. We think it's fair that in relation to making that contribution that there be
a two year waiting period before going onto Jobsearch Allowance.

         What perhaps should be referred to

are you implying? Is this going to apply to family allowances?' Mr Howard replied, `Of course it
won't apply to family allowances or any of those other things that would interfere with the life of
the migrant.' He said that it would not apply. We are saying that it should not apply to those
amendments that are now being voted against by the government because they have been moved in the
Senate to bring the government back to honesty and

Senator Newman, a high ranking cabinet minister, say on ABC radio that, after the Senate rejected
the bill, migrants in this country would be able to ride on the backs of the battlers from the day
they arrived. Is this the type of debate that we want to see going in amendments to a bill such as
this?

million. Then, in a matter of four or five hours, the Treasurer said, `I was saying $200 million,
and now you are saying $400 million. I will grab the $400 million.' The minister has now said that
those figures were incorrect.

         I believe that the amendments we are

Newman, sought to show that common respect.

that he was going to make it as hard as possible. The problem is that the Senate will not let them.
I believe that we in this House have to remind the coalition that it is not in their commitments.

add more than $400 million to the budget deficit over the next four years, and it will seriously
damage the integrity and public confidence in our immigration program—and that is perhaps the
most serious impact of the opposition's amendments in relation to these matters. Few Australians

second wife could come into the country. He said that he did so under duress because we would not

outrageous. They should not be accepted from the point of view of social justice and the government
certainly does not have a mandate for them. But one has to wonder about all the threats that have
been made as a result of the actions of the Senate. We have heard everything from `We're going to

        The fact is that the

going to miss out on some form of social security net, but that any person who is applying to
immigrate to Australia is being informed today—and has been since April—that they will
not be able to access these measures for the first two years. They come here with that knowledge.
Did you hear me? They come with that knowledge. Therefore, if they choose to immigrate to this
country—the lucky country as it is—they also must understand that it comes with
responsibilities that they have to be able to fend for themselves for two years. Gee, what an
unreasonable proposition to put to people!

health care card.' The reason is because they are self-funded retirees. They see this as being
somehow a most unfortunate situation. How much more unfortunate do they see it when they see a
person arriving on our shore and, within a few short months, accessing that very same card? Is that

refugee humanitarian program for the benefit of a couple of the new members on the opposition
benches who were not in this place when it was brought into disrepute by the previous government.
The refugee humanitarian program was brought into disrepute when then Prime Minister Hawke made
what was, in effect, a unilateral decision—initially without consulting his own
cabinet—to allow the Chinese students to remain in Australia, post the Tiananmen Square
massacre. That was a decision that he made unilaterally. His cabinet fell in behind him because of
the circumstances. As a consequence, our refugee humanitarian program fell into very serious
disrepute.

        I challenge any of the members on the Labor
side to disagree with that proposition. In fact, I know that at the time within the Labor Party
itself there was a very strong sentiment amongst a number of the members that this was the wrong
decision to have made. I know that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the
member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and I actually contributed to the debates at the time to alert the
House in relation to what was, in essence, the undermining of what had been until then a program to
which Australia had contributed as part of its humanitarian effort. It became a political football
and, unfortunately, now we find the situation where, as a consequence of that and as a consequence
of the policy decisions made by the previous minister, as outlined by the current minister in
question time on a couple of occasions recently, the immigration program had become skewed in such
a way that it also became subject to disrepute.

from her electorate representing some of the anguish that many of the citizens around the country

this anguish because the previous government brought it into serious disrepute by using it as a
political tool.

into the abyss that was facing the Labor Party before the last election. He could see what was at
the bottom of the abyss. What was in the abyss was, of course, this huge electoral defeat, because
the Labor Party had divorced itself very strongly from the sentiments of mainstream
Australia.

exactly how it is going to work and where those in the process know exactly how they are going to
be treated. The Senate amendments have

         —To my colleagues who are interjecting at this moment,
I say that it is not at all enlightening to have comments of that kind made. We actually have a
situation where these measures, in the main, go to working Australians who have come here and
settled as permanent residents in this country. They are paying their taxes, but they are being
held out from that range of benefits which attach to ordinary taxpaying Australians. For example,
the parenting allowance is no more than the old dependent spouse rebate. So what is the difference
between that and the family tax benefit, for example?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition went into the last campaign claiming to be a family friendly party.
They said that they would lift the tax threshold and allow low income people to cash out at a DSS
as a cash transfer. That is exactly the same thing as the parenting allowance. So you have got this
discriminatory policy that says to people who are working and living here as permanent residents
that they will be treated in a discriminatory way on ordinary measures that are intrinsically part
of the taxation system. That is a fundamentally wrong principle to adopt. To suggest that people
come off the boat to get onto things such as the widow's allowance—they come off the boat so
that their partner can die—is nonsense.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Consider the
situation: if you were to marry somebody who happened to come from overseas and had a child, your
family would not get the family allowance benefits that every other Australian gets, even if you
were in the work force. These are outrageous provisions. They are provisions that the then
opposition spokesperson, in talking about
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         these matters, said
should not in any way be applied in a discriminatory manner.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In
fact, the coalition documents before the election expressly said that all these matters should not
be the subject of any discriminatory policy. So how is it that we have this fraudulent outrage that
people come off the boat in order to get benefits of this nature? What they do is come here to get
a job, and 75 per cent of all people who come to this country as migrants never seek income support
at all. And those people are being denied the range of ordinary support that working, battling
families get. They are paying their taxes, they are paying their Medicare levies. And what are they
expected to do? Not get the ordinary transfer payments that exist within the taxation system that
other Australians are entitled to.

for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) got up with great panache, he thought, and
explained to the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) that special benefits were going to be changed. He
well knows, even when he covered social security, that special benefits are a discretionary
payment. They are a payment of last resort that is sought when all other avenues have been
explored. That comment also needs to go into

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has to be very careful, however, that its search for savings does
not disturb the equity of the social security system. Unfortunately, that equity is a casualty of
the way the Government has singled out migrants for special attention. The decision to exclude them
from benefits to which other permanent residents are entitled is not justified. People who are
accepted as migrants are normally healthier and better able to get employment than the average
Australian because of the way the selection process works. None come to Australia to rort the
welfare system. Those who, through no fault of their own, come to need social security support
should not be denied it simply because they have not been here for those several years.

        That is an important point to get into this debate, because we on this side of the House have
been accused of not understanding or appreciating what the electorate is all about. What we do know

statements of this government.

up and be counted, regardless of the racism debate. Most particularly, we should never single out
those people who come to this country and make a contribution to it. We are treating them as the
cause of all the problems that the government perceives. The problems are that the government
cannot manage its own business, it has made commitments to the electorate at large and it has lied
to the electorate at large.

        This is a coded debate which I find most
unfortunate. It is most unfortunate because before the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural
Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who is at the table, came to the role that he currently holds, he did have an
honourable role in the Australian parliament. When measures of like nature were proposed in earlier
times and when his then leader and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) sought in 1988 to raise issues of
similar contention, he crossed the floor.

         —On a
range of issues in the past, the minister has taken strong stands which are entirely consistent
with positions that are now being taken by the opposition. What has provoked this change? The
simple fact is that this change has been provoked because, from opposition, he has now come into
government; a government led by a Prime Minister who is prepared to take the low road on these
issues, a Prime Minister who has not distinguished himself by leadership in a debate which is
current in the Australian community. Far from being a person of courage, he is now the cat's paw of
the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is leading him to take steps which, I am sure, in his own

         man. But I suspect
that, 10 years from now, when the pressure of office is lifted from him, he will come to reflect on
these years as being years when he ought to have done more to resist these kinds of measures.
Certainly it will be of no benefit to Australia as a coherent and sound society if we come to a
point where we develop two classes of persons living in this country, and where there are those who
are treated differently because of the fact that they have arrived recently. It has never been the
case in Australia before. We have had a strong, effective growing economy—a vibrant and
healthy economy. We have gone through a long period post&amp;hyphen;war when we never needed measures
of this draconian nature. It has never been necessary—it is not necessary now.

        We can have a debate about what levels of immigration are appropriate. That, I
know, is an issue upon which different views are legitimately held by many. But to allow this
situation to develop to a point where people are being treated differently because of their
background and where children who came to this country and are part of Australian families growing
up in Australia—working families—are being treated differently from other children in
this country because of the nature of their background seems quite improper and completely
inconsistent with anything the minister would have stood for previously at any time in his 24 years
in parliamentary service. It is one of the ironies of political life that he is now the author of
this legislation.

the face of what the Labor Party has itself done in office over time. Let us understand the
principle. The principle of whether or not people are entitled to access benefits is one in which
you can have differential provisions. There were differential provisions under legislation that you
put in place. The six&amp;hyphen;month waiting provision was a differential provision. That is exactly
what it was. The issue of when you grant people when they come through the door an age
pension—we have said 10 years is the period for which there will be a preclusion

discrimination when we are dealing with this legislation. We are not talking about issues of racial
discrimination in this legislation. That point needs to be made carefully, because there is no
place for misrepresenting my principled approach to race, upon which I have been consistent and

have heard in this debate people say, `If you went to such and such a place, it wouldn't happen
that way.' The example is often given of the United States. The truth is that the United States
treats its own people very badly when it comes to welfare. It treats its own people appallingly
when it comes to medical benefits. It treats its own people very badly when it comes to things like
income support and a whole range of things which we in Australia take pride in.

time of this legislation, a matter which really is properly sheeted home to the government. The
other matter, of course, is the attributed cost to special benefit. Senator Newman quoted in the
Senate the other day a cost of $65.3 million over four years for having to pay a special benefit to
the estimated 30 per cent of new migrants who will be eligible for such a payment due to hardship
caused by extending to two years the waiting period for unemployment and sickness benefits. But the
coalition, in its own

        When
the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was asked about these matters, about his costings, did he come up and

the six-month waiting period that the Labor Party introduced'? No. He referred to unemployment
benefits. I believe it was a deliberate and straightforward intention to introduce a waiting period
by simply extending the six months to two years. When they came to office they realised their
costings were as flawed as we said, and they decided to go a bit deeper.

        In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wrote to Senator Newman, referring to
Senator Newman's own objections to including the child support cash rebate and other measures,

their first list things such as the double orphan benefit. It was a root and branch exercise in
moving from a position where they gave no plausible basis whatsoever for their electors to
anticipate these measures.

deliberate. The reason for the use of the word `allowance' was to make it clear that special
benefits in their wider operation ought not be seen as an alternative for those who were excluded
from being able to get other forms of benefits. It was to be available in the form of a special
allowance in those circumstances which arose after a person's arrival in Australia for reasons
beyond their control. It was to distinguish this form of payment from a special benefit. That
clearly meant that special benefit was meant to be the subject of a preclusion clause in its wider
definition.

family reunion category or the family preferential category to the extent that it has come into
such disrepute that many people throughout the country now consider the immigration program as
being unable to support it. That has happened because the previous Labor administration chose to

         —I
really must respond to those comments of the member for Moore (Mr Filing). The difficulty we have
is that the member for Moore is suggesting somehow that this is to do with the refugee program. I
know that he is not interested in that program, but the fact is that most of these provisions do
not apply to refugees at all. There is a point that comes up which I think is of some significance
for this government, as it was for the previous government. If we have a person in a refugee camp
in Germany or in Croatia who has family in Australia, do we ask them to sponsor that refugee? If we
do, do we give that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          refugee a preference because of that
sponsorship?
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we do that, that migrant becomes a
sponsored migrant in which case the sponsor is liable for their support. In a sense that can
distort the family reunion program because a substantial part of the refugee program is absorbed or
picked up by the family reunion program. Most people have thought that is a sensible thing to do
because, if there is a refugee in a country with family in Australia, they have a much better
chance of being successful migrants than a person who has no family whatsoever.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What this provision will do is the opposite of what the member suggests. If the
family in Australia realises that they are going to be liable for all those downstream costs and
not simply income support, they will not sponsor them. The person will probably still be successful
but will be unsponsored, so the taxpayers will pay more. That is what is going to happen. This is
the nonsense of this whole debate, because the government is pushing an agenda which is not about
the real issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If every refugee came to Australia as a sponsored
refugee, the chances of success are enormously high for successful settlement. If they are all
unsponsored, the chances are reduced. We all know that. If one looks at the people on the dole from
non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and looks at their status on arrival, they will see that
substantial numbers of them were refugees. They are the ones with the most difficulty in adjusting.
They are the ones who have the most difficulty with the language. They have had the most traumatic
backgrounds. If any of you have dealt with the Bosnian refugees, you would understand that. Many of
them missed schooling for years and years of their life. They have come from enormously difficult
backgrounds. They need a great deal of help. If they have a family here who will sponsor them, this
is much more likely to be successful.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">

brings his wife and three children back to Australia. We have literally tens of thousands of
Australians living overseas with spouses and children born overseas, and in many cases the children
are not registered as Australian citizens. People are not aware of that. This person has no other

        These amendments essentially deal with three forms of payment:
sickness benefits, newstart and the youth training allowance. In relation to each of these forms of
payment, the amendments seek to exempt certain partners of newly arrived residents from the waiting
period. With respect to the newstart allowance, using it as an example, the amendment seeks to
maintain the exemption from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period that
currently applies to a person who is a member of a couple immediately before entering Australia and
whose partner has been in Australia for at least 26 weeks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In
opposing this measure, the government is of the view that, in omitting these provisions that have
previously provided a special treatment for partners of newstart allowees, the amendment proposed
by the government in the bill as introduced was consistent with the approach that the former
government had adopted; that is, the person should qualify for a social security payment in their
own right. The amendment now proposed is contrary to that approach. The amendment should be opposed
on the ground that it would require only that a person's partner had been an Australian resident
for at least 26 weeks, not 104 weeks. This is not justifiable on policy grounds and will result in
complexity of administration. The same argument applies to each of the other separate
amendments.

period for the new person arriving will only be six months. It seems that to allow families to be
bereft of that income support net for, effectively, a period of four years or thereabouts, by
reason of these particular amendments, is excessive, notwithstanding the comments that the minister
makes about wishing to treat individuals in the social security system on their own individual
merits. Nonetheless, the combined impact of this measure seems so draconian that we think it is

        As the bill was passed by the Senate last
week, yet purported to extend many of the penal measures to people who had been in Australia and
commenced their residence under the law as it then existed, which had very different provisions,
and who would have finished any preclusion period which they might have otherwise had to
serve—the six-month period—the government's position on this now is simply ludicrous.
It may have made some plausible sense when persons were expected to serve a preclusion period of
six months if the bill had been brought in and dealt with so that those people would have
        <break page="7596" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

of the proposition that somehow people who have served a preclusion period under existing law now

motive. There is no rational, plausible or social benefit reason for any of these measures. Indeed,
the implausibility of the minister's position is illustrated by the point I made earlier in debate
when we were discussing the consented amendments. I made the point that it was in fact the
government's delay in bringing forth this legislation with any degree of urgency whatsoever in the
Senate that meant that the bill could not be dealt with before retrospectivity had to apply under
whatever test you sought to imagine.

all the other elements that we agree with, they are going to wait now for at least three months,
and probably longer depending on the parliamentary timetable, forgoing those benefits. The cost of
that forgoing to the Australian community is going to be in the order of $12.5 million to $25

        The House of Representatives considers that these
amendments—to not introduce newly arrived resident's waiting periods for carer pension, widow
allowance, disability wage supplement, mature age allowance, special benefit, partner allowance,
maternity allowance, parenting allowance, mobility allowance, seniors health card, more than the
minimum rate of family payment and health care cards—should not proceed as they would
counteract the electoral mandate given to the Government at the 1996 election to introduce its
election commitment relating to imposing a two year newly arrived resident's waiting period on most
welfare benefits. The House of Representatives notes that access of newly arrived migrants to
Australian social security payments compares favourably with other western nations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With respect to carer pension, it is noted that the Government had intended moving
amendments in the Senate to take account of recommendation 3 of the majority report of the Senate
Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that special needs relatives be exempt from the carer
pension newly arrived resident's waiting period, as well as exempting refugees, former refugees or
a family member of the refugee or former refugee from that waiting period. The House of
Representatives is of the view that those amendments should have prevailed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment proposed by the Senate in relation to widow allowance (Senate
amendment (17)) would result in a disparity in access between widow allowance and newstart
allowance despite the eligibility criteria for widow allowance having always essentially been
aligned with those applying for newstart allowance. Previously, widow allowance has been subject to
a 26 week residence requirement, akin to the 26 week newly arrived resident's waiting period for
newstart allowance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The House of Representatives considers that the
introduction of a newly arrived resident's waiting period for disability wage supplement addresses
concerns that in deciding to come to Australia, migrants should be aware of the need to provide
adequately for themselves after they arrive in Australia so as not to make undue calls on the
Australian taxpayer. The House of Representatives notes, however, that there has been a
recognition, as reflected in the legislation, that circumstances
        <break page="7598" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         sometimes change after a person arrives in Australia and that as a result, the newly
arrived resident's waiting period will not apply to a person who first suffered a continuing
inability to work in Australia because of an impairment or who becomes permanently blind while in
Australia. Therefore, the House of Representatives does not consider that the Senate amendment
relating to disability wage supplement (Senate amendment (18)) is warranted.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The House of Representatives believes that any failure to introduce a newly arrived
resident's waiting period for special benefit will operate to effectively undermine the newly
arrived resident's waiting periods that operate for other income support payments, such as newstart
allowance. The Senate amendments relating to special benefit would allow many unemployed people to
avoid the two year waiting period provisions, and therefore the House of Representatives does not
consider that the Senate amendment relating to special benefit is warranted. Although the
Government had proposed that a newly arrived resident's waiting period should apply for special
benefit, the House of Representatives notes that the Government had and continues to recognise the
importance of ensuring that there is an adequate safety net to take care of those persons who
suffer substantial changes in their circumstances beyond their control.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To that end, the Bill as introduced and passed by the House of Representatives had
provided that such persons would be exempt from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting
period. Further, it is understood that the Government had indicated to the Senate that it proposed
moving a number of concessionary amendments to the special benefit provisions to take on board
those recommendations made by the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs
Committee that impacted on special benefit.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With respect to partner
allowance, the vast majority of those receiving partner allowance are spouses of recipients of
newstart allowance. Prior to July 1995 the unemployed person would have received the partnered rate
of unemployment payment and been excluded from this combined payment for 26 weeks. The House of
Representatives understands that the amendments proposed by the Government in the Bill as
introduced with respect to partner allowance are a further step in a process instigated by the
former Government of ensuring that persons qualify for social security payments in their own right.
The House of Representatives endorses this position and so opposes Senate amendment  (26).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The House of Representatives disagrees with Senate amendment (28) relating to
parenting allowance. Parenting allowance is an income support payment and as such, has always been
aligned with other income support payments such as newstart allowance. It was introduced in July
1995 by the previ
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         ous Government to make available a payment
to those looking after children, to compensate for the abolition of the partnered rate of social
security benefits. It is noted that for that reason, newly arrived resident waiting provisions
mirroring those applicable to newstart allowance were inserted into the Social Security Act 1991
when parenting allowance was introduced by the former Government in July 1995.

        The House of Representatives does not agree that there is a need for Senate
amendments (32) or (36) on the basis that the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting
period for the seniors health card or health care cards would cause undue hardship. Persons subject
to a newly arrived resident's waiting period would still have immediate access to Medicare. These
concession cards provide access to Commonwealth and State/Territory concessions which newly arrived
migrants should not expect to receive immediately upon entry to Australia.

        The House of Representatives

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not agree with amendments (20), (23)
and (34) that would seek for newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance,
respectively, to maintain the exemption from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting
period that currently applies to a person who is a member of a couple immediately before entering
Australia and whose partner has been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In any event, the House of Representatives considers that it would be
inappropriate, in the light of the newly arrived resident's waiting period being extended to 104
weeks, to continue to require only that a newly arrived migrant's partner who has been an
Australian resident for 26 weeks before the newly arrived migrant could claim an exemption from the
operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period. Such a disparity would not be justifiable
on policy grounds, in view of the individual entitlement to social security payments and will
result in complexity in administration.

        The House of Representatives accepts that there was

was proposed that the extended waiting period should apply, that is, 1 April 1996. Further, the
House of Representatives understands that information foreshadowing the Government's new policy was
provided to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs by the Department of Social
Security. This was distributed to overseas posts on 19 March 1996 to provide to all visa applicants
and to successful visa applicants when a visa is issued; to migration applicants who had already
received a visa but had not arrived in Australia on 21 March 1996; and on 27 March 1996 to all

Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The Committee notes that the provisions in the
Bill relating to special benefits are prospective. Therefore new residents who arrive after 1 April
1996 and before the Royal Assent of the Bill will be eligible for special benefits under current
arrangements. In the Committee's view, these provisions provide an appropriate transition and will
allay concerns about this aspect of the Bill.".

       All of the six SkillShare sponsors were offered contract extensions from 1 July to 30 September 1996. The funding allocation for the 3 month extension was based on 1/6th of the total funding made available under their 1995/96 contract which equates to a 33% reduction in funding. Additional funding was, however, made available to all SkillShare sponsors under the Jobsearch Assistance Activities in proportion to their SkillShare contract extension funding. This effectively brought the overall reduction in funding to around 20% of 1995/96 levels. The reductions in SkillShare funding for the period between 1 July and 30 September 1996 were:

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) The first question relates to withdrawal of consent to be bound by the terms of a treaty at international law. In respect of treaties between parties to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (`Vienna Convention') that are entered into after the Vienna Convention's entry into force (27 January 1980), that Convention sets out the international legal regime governing those treaties. Australia is a party to the Vienna Convention and would observe its terms. The Vienna Convention sets out the body of rules regulating denunciation of treaties falling within this category. In accordance with those rules, treaties containing no provision for denunciation could be denounced either with the consent of the parties (Article 54) or pursuant to the terms of Article 56, the terms of which the honourable member has reproduced in his first question. The Vienna Convention also sets out certain circumstances in which a party may withdraw from or denounce a treaty outside of the terms of Articles 54 and 56. These are addressed in response to the second question. In addition, there is some debate in the textbooks as to whether Article 56 of the Vienna Convention reflects the position at customary international law. The terms of the Vienna Convention are in many respects largely declaratory of customary international law. In relation to those treaties that are not governed by the provisions of the Vienna Convention the body of customary international law relating to treaties would govern such issues as denunciation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) The majority of treaties contain provision for denunciation and could be denounced according to those terms. Of those treaties which do not contain such a provision, a large number would fall within the terms of Article 56, which are rather broad. The  types of treaties that are usually given as examples of treaties not subject to unilateral denunciation are peace treaties, treaties establishing boundaries, and important law&amp;hyphen;making treaties. In practice, there would be very few treaties that could not be de
       <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
        nounced. There are detailed provisions in the Vienna Convention that set out other circumstances where under international law it would be possible to withdraw from or denounce a treaty without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. Articles 60&amp;hyphen;64 of the Vienna Convention set out these rights in some detail, and Section 4 of the Vienna Convention sets out the procedures that would be followed by a party invoking those rights. These provisions address such issues as denunciation because of a material breach of the treaty by the other (or another) party, supervening impossibility of performance, fundamental change of circumstances, severance of diplomatic or consular relations, or the emergence of a new peremptory norm of general international law. There are also issues that may arise under customary international law, such as desuetude and obsolescence, that could be relevant to withdrawal from a treaty. There is a large body of international legal jurisprudence regarding withdrawal from treaties that may be referred to in this regard, should the honourable member require further elucidation.

       (2) and (3) The major research and analysis effort behind the current direction of housing reform was the 1993 report of the Industry Commission, entitled
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Public Housing
       </emphasis>
       . The Industry Commission's report called for a major reform of housing assistance, including clarification of Commonwealth and State responsibilities; improvements to rental subsidy arrangements to improve
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        equity and client choice of housing; and greater accountability and effectiveness of public housing. The Industry Commission recommended a move away from capital funding of public housing to recurrent funding arrangements.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The type and level of service that will be provided through State public housing and private sources will depend on the outcome of current negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States on future housing roles and responsibilities, including rental subsidy delivery. There is potential for the public housing system to play a greater role in assisting people with special housing needs that can be difficult to meet in private rental.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Currently, people on low incomes receive housing assistance through two separate programs. The Commonwealth and State governments provide funds for the provision of public housing, and the Commonwealth provides separate Rent Assistance payments for private renters. Under the proposed reforms, the Commonwealth would provide rental subsidies for both private and public tenants. The States would continue to manage and deliver public housing, along with their related responsibilities for welfare, disability and health services.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Depending on the outcome of subsidy reform negotiations with the States, a more equitable rental subsidy system could make private housing more affordable, and so ease the pressure on public waiting lists. This would help people who may need prompt access to public housing, including people with medical conditions and disabilities and those facing discrimination or homelessness, who may have difficulty meeting their housing needs in the private rental market. Subsidy reform could also better enable people without special housing needs to find suitable housing in the private rental market.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (4) The Commonwealth is working with State and Territory governments to develop options for housing reform, including rental subsidy design. In these negotiations the Commonwealth will support the following principles relating to costs for consumers:

       (5) The Government is not reducing funding for housing assistance.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The potential financial costs to the Commonwealth and the States under the reforms will depend on the final allocation of housing roles and responsibilities. If the Commonwealth were to become responsible for housing affordability in public and private rental for people on low incomes, for example, this shift in responsibility would need to be accompanied by a commensurate adjustment in Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;State financial resources.
       <break page="7611" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       There are compelling reasons to believe that social costs would be reduced by housing reform. Greater equity in rental subsidy delivery could improve housing affordability for many people on low incomes and assist the achievement of greater independence. Improved affordability would deliver the financial and social benefits of better enabling people to choose housing which suits their employment or education goals, or their need to be close to family or other support networks or services. The potential to provide better access to public housing for people with special housing needs (explained in (3) above) would similarly reduce social costs which may arise if special needs were otherwise met at a lesser level in the private rental market.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (6) There has been much consultation throughout the development of housing reform, including consultation associated with the report of the Industry Commission; subsequent consultation with housing providers and their representatives; consultation with tenants' associations and continuing dialogue with National Shelter and ACOSS. No decisions have been made on the final model of housing reform, and the Commonwealth has proposed to State and Territory Governments that there be wide consultations on this matter. The Commonwealth will continue to consult key community representatives as housing reform proceeds.

       Requests from the governments of New Zealand, USA, Thailand and Denmark for chicken meat date back to the mid 1980s. The Department's records for this period are in archives and available files do not go back far enough to provide an exact date in response to this question. The quarantine issues associated with the importation of cooked chicken meat have been the subject of extensive consideration by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) since 1990.
