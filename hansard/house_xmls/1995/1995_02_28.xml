         An evaluation group was established to oversee the pilot service to Commonwealth agencies and to make recommendations on a long-term strategy to provide wider community electronic access to parliamentary materials. One of the evaluation group recommendations is likely to be that public access to parliamentary materials be provided through public libraries and community information networks to individuals via the Internet. This is a global network of databases and information sources. The evaluation group has proposed that, before a final decision on the use of the Internet is made, it should be tried for a period of six months. The trial will involve assistance from the Australian National University provided at no cost to the parliament.

         —The Hawke-Keating government's phased reductions in tariffs was, and still is, not accompanied by any reduction in imposed costs on our manufacturers. This includes the high costs of utilities, freight and transport. Micro-economic reform is an issue that this government has talked about for many years. We have encouraged the government to address this issue time and time again in this place, but it still remains on the books as an item to be dealt with.

         I noticed in the newspaper this morning a report that our wharves, the heart of our transport system exporting goods from this country, are decreasing in efficiency, notwithstanding the fact that this government has spent over $350 million of taxpayers' funds and that industry has spent a comparable amount in order to reform work practices on the wharves and to help make us competitive. The reports in today's press indicate that, instead of our position improving worldwide, the position of our wharves is getting worse. Container ships are in our ports longer and longer. That imposes costs on industry. It means that our costs of shipping from Australia to other countries are greater than what they ought to be. It means that we are less competitive in the international marketplace. It is just one more major item associated with the massive demise of our manufacturing industry in Australia that this government needs to be called to task for. The demise of manufacturing is the major point I wish to raise in my contribution to this debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994.

         I note that, while the government has been quietly reducing tariffs—I congratulate it for this position—it has made no changes to and no major structural reform of our industrial relations system. We talk about tariffs as being an item of protection. Tariffs are protection: they protect local manufacturers against the efficiencies and cost effectiveness of manufacturers from other countries. But our industrial relations system acts to protect workers from their bosses, supposedly, or from their own desires. In effect, we have third parties determining what ought to be matters of negotiation and resolution between workers and the people that they work with and for. In this way, companies and their employees can reach solutions about how they are paid that allows the work force to be well paid, that allows them to become part of the operation and that allows them to become part of the business and to feel that they have ownership in the business and pride in their work.

         I note that for a long time now we have been well and truly out of the major recession brought about by this government, yet we still have unemployment at high, structurally unacceptable  levels.  Over  800,000 Australians still do not have work. In recent times, many of those people who have found work have taken the opportunity of securing part-time employment or casual employment as they are unable to find full-time jobs.

         It is my view that much of this problem of our long-term unemployment can be sheeted home to the fact that we no longer manufacture enough of those goods which Australians require and desire to purchase. So as we come out of recession, as people start to open up their pocketbooks and feel confident in the economy once again and they go out to buy whatever it is they want to buy, we find that we are sucking in imports to satisfy that demand rather than manufacturing those products on the Australian market.

         In that respect it is clear that in recent months we have seen a dramatic increase in Australia's exports of radically transformed manufactured goods. But, at the same time, we have seen not only a corresponding but a greater increase in imports of manufactured goods. We now have a deficit in manufactured goods of $35 billion a year—and we are supposed to make that up with increases in services and increases in commodities. So, after 12 long, hard years of Labor, Australia is still dependent on its commodities to satisfy its standard of living.

         So we have a government today which is examining increasing interest rates still further to try to depress demand, increasing taxes to try to offset to some extent its negative balance of payments problem and, at our insistence again and again, talking finally about decreasing government spending. We have been living on the bankcard for a long time but we have this huge structural problem—and it is a structural problem. It is not a problem of interest rates. It is not a problem of our taxes being too low. Our problem is the fact that we do not manufacture enough of those things that we want and we do not do enough other things to offset the huge deficit in manufactured goods.

If this government is not very careful as it adjusts its economic policy in the next few months as we come to the next budget, it might bring on another recession. Then we will find that unemployment blows out up into the teens—and Australians cannot afford that. Australians want to work. Australians are hard workers and dedicated to employment and we need Australians, desperately, in employment.

One of the amendments resulting from this legislation seeks to decrease the customs duty payable on top crude oil by 2.977c per litre to 6.586c per litre and to decrease the customs duty payable on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 1.977c per litre to 6.586c per litre.

         Additionally, the bill affects the Australian system of tariff preferences which provides for preferential treatment on imports from developing countries. The countries which fall into this category will receive a discount of five per cent on general industry assistance tariffs. The bill also provides for a general rate of customs duty for semi-finished lenses. However, the amendment which I specifically wish to address is the reduction in customs duty payable on aviation gasoline and the increase in the rate of customs duty payable on aviation kerosene.

         There are two methods by which customs tariffs can be altered—firstly, through legislation and, secondly, through the introduction of customs tariff proposals, which are subsequently supported by legislation. The amendments we have before the House today result from the latter method of adjusting customs tariffs. With effect from 1 July 1994, customs tariff proposal No. 3 proposed a reduction in customs duty payable on aviation gasoline by 6.327c per litre and an increase in the rate of customs duty payable on aviation kerosene by 1.194c per litre.

         According to the explanatory memorandum of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), the rate increase continues the process of recovering from the aviation industry the full costs incurred in implementing aviation safety standards, which commenced on 1 July 1994, and 50 per cent of the costs of safety standard setting and compliance phased in over two years from 1 July back in 1993. The government has also stated that the rate reduction for aviation kerosene is a result of the adoption by the CAA—the Civil Aviation Authority—of a marginal cost basis for pricing of services provided to operators of aviation gasoline powered aircraft.

         Politicians in this House will remember the initial furore that erupted in the community over these proposed increases in fuel tax, especially amongst coastal shippers and mineral processors. On 6 September 1993, a coalition of shipping industry groups, including BHP and the Maritime Union, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). At the time that group estimated that the impact of a 5c per litre increase in excise on marine fuel oil would result in a cost impost on Australian coastal shipping of $16.1 million—or $358,000 per vessel—per annum by August 1994.

         What was most annoying to the shipping industry was that, in one fell swoop, the government was able to obliterate any savings flowing from hard fought Australian shipping industry reforms in relation to manning levels. With the ink barely dry on the reform agreement to reduce manning costs by some $270,000 per vessel per annum, the government then imposed a tax impost of $360,000 per vessel per annum, wiping out any potential gains for the industry—in fact, the industry was further behind by $90,000 per vessel. Similarly, the mineral processing sector was hit by the fuel oil tax hike but in a number of different ways.

         The Australian Maritime Association estimated in 1993 that nearly 60 per cent of the coastal shipping task was for the carriage of minerals for further processing. So, not surprisingly, the freight costs for shipping minerals around our coastline were set to rise because of this tax hike. More importantly for the value adding sector was the direct impact of the tax hike on its production costs. My colleague the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has already spelt out how a 5c per litre increase in fuel oil would have added $9 per tonne to Nabalco's production costs, effectively imposing a 13 per cent levy on its alumina exports.

         The impact was equally devastating for another alumina refiner, QAL, which, as I said earlier, is in my electorate of Hinkler. While this company had converted from fuel oil to natural gas in 1989 because of previous fuel oil hikes, the impact of the 5c a litre rise was still estimated to cost the company an additional $8.2 million. This is because the pricing formula for its natural gas contract includes a component pegged to the delivery costs of fuel oil plus excise. There is a tendency for gas prices, even though they are not related directly to excise, to follow the fuel oil price upwards. So any time there is an excise adjustment to fuel oil it is felt indirectly in natural gas.

But, as history records during the tortuous 1993-94 budget negotiations in the Senate, the government was forced to back down on a number of fuel tax measures, including the final 3c a litre rate increase for leaded petrol, adjusting the total rise for leaded petrol to 7c a litre instead of 10c; and the February and August 1994 increases for fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene, taking the rise to 3c instead of 5c.

Far from having saved the shipping industry $8.4 million a year, the decision still leaves in place 1c per litre of the 1993-94 increase, which is still costing the industry $4.2 million a year or $96,000 per vessel per year.

It is disappointing to see that the government has decided not to re-examine the impact of the fuel tax rises on this sector, in particular, diesel and petrol. The Road Transport Forum estimated that the 5c a litre increase in excise on diesel fuel has cost the average truckie an extra $6,000 per rig per year, not to mention an additional $400 or so per year per rig for the extra two per cent rise in sales tax on tyres and associated equipment.

         —in reply—In summing up on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2), I will initially answer the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) before commenting on the contributions of other honourable members. I wish to simply let the honourable member for Hinkler know that there is a decrease of 1.977c per litre in the duty on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene.

         —The honourable member should read the bill and the explanatory memorandum instead of waffling on in this chamber, trying to misrepresent the situation. There has been a decrease of 2.977c per litre in the duty on topped crude oil. In this summing up, why is it necessary for me to correct these issues? I am disappointed in the honourable member for Hinkler in that regard.

         Turning to the speech of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), there has been a wide ranging debate outside the normal latitude allowed in the standing orders of this House when dealing with this technical bill. The fact is that on 12 October 1994 the government announced that it would assume financial responsibility for the public interest component of aviation safety regulation. The government's contribution will fund that portion of aviation safety regulation that has been identified as being of benefit to the general public.
        </tab>

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We say, as is recognised by aviation users, that this demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that aviation safety regulation in Australia is adequately funded, and so it must be. That is why the government will lift its contribution from the former index cap of $22.8 million per year to more than $29 million in 1995-96. These new funding arrangements will apply to the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which is scheduled to commence operation on 1 July 1995.

         This bill is part of a package of measures being introduced by the government to ensure that the needs of air safety regulation in Australia and the requirements of aviation users in Australia are satisfactorily met. Indeed, the increase of 1.194c per litre in the customs duty on aviation turbine fuel is balanced by an equivalent increase in the moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral, and that is also the case on aviation gasoline. That point must be made.

         Normally, I would not comment on the contributions made by honourable members because they are outside the technical nature of the bill, but some of the statements made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) need to be corrected on the record. The latest Bureau of Industry Economics industry brief report dated February 1995, which is a public document, states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The manufacturing sector is growing almost twice as fast as the economy overall. The output growth of 12.2 per cent posted in the year to the September quarter 1994 is the highest on record and has resulted in much of the spare capacity within the manufacturing sector being taken up.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a very significant point. Manufacturing production grew steadily in the September quarter 1994, rising by 1.5 per cent, and the growth rate for the 12 months to the September quarter 1994 came in at 12.2 per cent. That is the highest since the Australian Bureau of Statistics quarterly series began in 1974 and, as the bureau says, it is a remarkable result. Furthermore, it states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current annual growth rate is around four times the long-term trend growth rate of total production within the Australian economy over the last two decades.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is in total contrast to the claims made by the honourable member for La Trobe. Where opposition members get the information to make these claims in the House really beggars imagination. All they need to do is obtain the relevant information from the Bureau of Industry Economics—it is all here and beyond debate—and use that information in this House if they wish. Again, he mentioned manufacturing investment. According to the bureau in its February bulletin, manufacturing investment:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . grew by 10.3 per cent . . . in the September quarter 1994, following a remarkable 19.5 per cent rise in the June quarter. This investment wave has been driven almost exclusively by rising investment in equipment, plant and machinery, contributing 90.9 per cent of the rise over the six months.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The strength of the recent investment surge is clearly demonstrated by the fact that equipment, plant and machinery investment levels are now 3.5 per cent higher than the pre-recession peak in the June quarter 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report goes on to deal with the imports of products and, in particular, the manufacturing product groups which very much deal with the investment intensive machinery and equipment dominated imports and so forth, which ultimately go to produce our manufacturing capacity in this country.

         It is a source of disappointment for me to hear the honourable member for La Trobe, who is normally the most erudite and clear thinking individual, make these claims which are in clear contradiction of the information which is freely available to him from the Bureau of Industry Economics. I do not intend in this debate on a narrow bill to deal with some of the other claims made by other speakers with respect to other economic indices.

         Security of investment is critical for resource projects as they are typified by high capital costs, high risk, long lead times between discovery and production, and finely judged financial returns. Thus, once the decision to invest has been made, resource projects are sensitive to changes in factors such as taxation arrangements and, in this case, excise and customs duties. In effect, the Gove operation has been singled out for discriminatory taxation treatment, seriously undermining its competitiveness with refineries in Australia and overseas.

         At the heart of this issue is the so-called Gove agreement between the Gove joint venturers and the governments of the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth. Clause 12, paragraph (1) of the agreement states:

         At the time of commissioning in 1972, fuel oil was not subject to excise or customs duty; nor was there any alternative to using fuel oil as an energy source at Gove. However, in 1983 the Labor government imposed a 2c per litre tax on fuel oil with the rate indexed to the consumer price index. While other Australian refiners were able to switch to natural gas to avoid this excise, this was not feasible at Gove.

         Although the imposition of the excise in 1983 could arguably have been in contravention of the Gove agreement—clause 12 that I have just read out, specifically—Nabalco was able to absorb the tax at this level. It is essential to remember that there is no possibility for Nabalco to pass on an impost of this kind to its customers. Aluminium is traded in a fiercely competitive international market, so any extraordinary costs on intermediate inputs such as fuel oil must be absorbed by the company and ultimately reduce the return to shareholders.

         After substantial investment at Gove in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nabalco was able to reduce its production costs by $10 per tonne of alumina. Meanwhile, the fuel oil excise was continuing to rise, kicked along by the government's iniquitous tactic of pegging the rate of excise to the consumer price index. By 1993, the excise had reached 5 1/2c per litre, and Nabalco was the only alumina refinery in Australia unable to switch from fuel oil to other energy sources.

         With consumption of some 465,000 litres of fuel oil per year, Nabalco was paying $26 million per year in excise, effectively losing the benefits of the efficiency improvements which had been made at the turn of the decade. Not content with this, the Labor government foreshadowed a 5c per litre increase in the fuel oil excise and customs duty in the 1993 budget. This would have almost doubled Nabalco's fuel oil excise bill, but the increases were subsequently held to 3c per litre by the parliament.

       <para first-indent="16">

         In the 1994 budget, the government recognised the impact of the increases on the mining and shipping industries and decreased the excise and customs duty by 1.977c per litre. This decrease in the customs duty will be enshrined in legislation as a result of the bill before the House. But compared with the situation just prior to the 1993 budget, Nabalco is still penalised an extra $4.7 million per year as a result of this rapid and ill-judged series of increases and decreases. In total, Nabalco continues to pay $30 million per year in fuel oil excise, which is 60 per cent of the revenue received from fuel oil excise other than that from coastal shipping.

         In summary, the imposition of this excise and customs duty impacts inequitably on one player in the fiercely competitive aluminium industry. There is also the question of whether the excise violates the Gove agreement, in which the Commonwealth agreed not to impose discriminatory taxes on the refinery. In any case, this saga highlights the extent of sovereign risk faced by business which is investing in Australia's resource industries. The government needs to bear in mind that any revenue which it thinks it will be winning by this legislation will ultimately be lost because of the effect of the legislation on the business investment climate.

         This bill, through its proposed changes to section 35 and 36 of the act—which were renumbered in December 1989 to become sections 87 and 88 respectively—seeks to restore to those sections the effect they were thought to possess prior to the decision of the High Court in Chu Kheng Lim v. Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in December 1992. It was this decision which gave rise to the commencement of claims against the Commonwealth for compensation for wrongful imprisonment of a number of unauthorised boat arrivals who are usually referred to as boat people. Prior to this decision no-one had questioned the use of section 36 of the act—from December 1989 to September 1994 numbered as section 88—to detain the unauthorised arrivals in question. Indeed, those sections were not challenged in the Lim proceedings.

         Section 36 of the act deals with people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation and who may be kept in custody until the departure of the vessel from its last port of call in Australia. Up until May 1991, unauthorised boat arrivals of this kind were detained in custody under this section while their claims to remain in Australia were assessed.

         In the Lim case, other aspects of migration legislation involving boat people were challenged and doubt was subsequently cast upon the lawfulness of detention for a number of boat people under section 88 once it became apparent that the boats on which they had arrived would never depart Australia. This doubt turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the understanding that the vessel be expected to leave Australia on a further, outward and ongoing voyage.

         In this instance, the Commonwealth acted on a mistaken view of what the law was, believing—like all other concerned parties—that its detention of boat people was lawful. It is significant that no-one, apparently including the boat people themselves—and their legal representatives—saw any reason to question the lawfulness of detention on the basis that none of the vessels on which they had arrived had ever left Australia. Should that custody prove to have been unlawful, it is as a result of an innocent and technical breach, and no more.

         This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people did arrive in Australia unlawfully, and their detention was based on the understanding of the provisions of section 36 (section 88) by the government and the department at that time. Nevertheless, actions for damages have been lodged by some 88 of the boat people who now maintain that their detention under section 36 (section 88) was unlawful.

These provisions, under which the boat people have been detained since May 1992, were found by the High Court in the Lim case to be constitutionally valid. However, at that time the High Court cast doubt upon the use of section 88 to detain boat people. As a consequence, section 54RA was enacted in late December 1992 with the support of the opposition. This section extinguished the right of action for damages for false imprisonment for persons found to have been unlawfully detained under section 88 prior to their transfer to custody under division 4B of the act, replacing it with a statutory right of action limiting to one dollar per day the damages payable.

        A case challenging the constitutional validity of the compensation scheme established in section 54RA—I repeat that the compensation scheme in section 54RA was regarded as constitutionally valid when it was established—is yet to be heard by the High Court. The main ground for challenge is likely to be that section 54RA breaches section 51(xxxi) of the constitution in that it involves an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth otherwise than on just terms. A number of High Court decisions since section 54RA was enacted on the ambit of the `just terms' requirement in the constitution have raised doubts whether the limit on damages to one dollar per day is constitutional.

The government has introduced this bill to the House with the intention of placing the Commonwealth in the strongest possible position to defend the claims for compensation. The bill seeks only to achieve the same effect as what was intended by the enactment of section 54RA; that is, to prevent a possible windfall of a substantial award of damages to persons who arrived in Australia without lawful authority and were held in detention for the legitimate reason of assessing their claims to stay in this country as refugees. In this way, the government seeks to ensure that section 88 has, and has always had, the effect and operation that parliament intended.

         Section 54RA limits any compensation payable to $1 per day after the cause of action concerned has already arisen.

         I turn now to the curative provisions of the bill. The amendments to sections 35 and 36 (sections 87 and 88) do not seek to change the operation of those sections but insert new provisions intended instead to reflect the Commonwealth's understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) and the manner in which they were actually administered in practice prior to the commencement of division 4B. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted at every stage of the drafting process. It is the view of that department that the amendments are not inconsistent with Australia's obligations under international law.

         The proposed subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) seeks to put beyond doubt that section 36 (section 88) authorises the custody, for a finite period, of persons who arrive without lawful authority on board a vessel that subsequently is unable to depart Australia because it has been destroyed or, for example, is not seaworthy, has been impounded or forfeited, has sunk, or is otherwise unable to depart.

It is restricted to persons who arrive on vessels that have left an Australian port and returned to an Australian port without having entered any other country. This covers situations where a person arrives at a port in Australia on an Australian based vessel, to which the person was transferred from the vessel on which that person left another country—for instance, to a rescue vessel when the original vessel is about to sink.

         —In following the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), I foreshadow that on this occasion we will not oppose the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), as she mentioned in her speech. We are reluctant converts in relation to this matter. We opposed the bill on the last occasion because of its retrospectivity. The bill is still retrospective in its impact. We took an on balance decision taking into account a number of matters, particularly the potential cost to the public purse if the bill did not proceed and community concern about paying compensation to people who arrived in Australia illegally, in this instance by boats.

         Since we took that decision we have been made aware of very considerable concerns—some of them generated I think by the way in which the government dealt with this matter—about rewarding illegal immigrants with compensation and of the increasing community concern generally about the ongoing arrival of people by boats in recent times where they do not appear prima facie to be bone fide refugee claimants. As has been the case previously, we have endeavoured to facilitate, and over the last several weeks have again facilitated, legislation to try to assist the government in dealing with these ongoing problems, notwithstanding the government's lamentable failure to deal with these matters in a timely fashion.

        The committee suggested that the first element was founded on the notion that an award of damages is a windfall. Inherent to the notion of a windfall is that the person who picks up by chance what the wind of fortune has cause to fall at his or her feet has no right to that property.
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on to say, however, that unlawful imprisonment, which this involved, carries a right to just compensation, and the concept of windfall has no application. On the second matter, the committee went on to say that the second element clearly trespassed on the basic right that those subject to law are entitled to know what the law says and be treated in accordance with what the law says, ultimately according to what the courts declare the law to mean. As far back as 1765 in his commentaries, Sir William Blackstone said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a base resolution, confined in the breast of the legislator, without manifesting itself by some external sign, can never be properly a law. It is requisite that this resolution be notified to the people who are to obey it.

        The committee went on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the committee's opinion the third element did not overcome the hurdle that the right of a person to challenge the unlawful excess of authority does not take away the obligation of the person exercising authority to ensure that the use of that authority is within power.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rationale given for retrospectivity, therefore, in the committee's view did not appear to justify validating unlawful imprisonment. The minister gave the committee the courtesy of a reply and that reply picked up some of the arguments that we have seen set out in the explanatory memorandum, reiterated again in the parliamentary secretary's speech today, although I think there are some new elements that I will address.

         The committee then deliberated on that matter again and came to the view that the minister had not addressed the concept of responsibility and accountability for a person exercising authority to ensure that the use of authority is within power. The scrutiny of bills committee could not be expected to agree that the law ought not to be what parliament has passed but what the minister thought had been passed. In other words, the scrutiny of bills committee, which included three Labor members, was of the opinion that this view was flawed. In a sense, some members of the government have come to an on-balance view on this matter. That is the reason, I assume, for their support of the bill, notwithstanding the views they have expressed in this report—seeing how they voted that way.

         The second reading speech the parliamentary secretary gave today was very interesting because it dealt with a number of matters—and I want to pick them up in turn—that suggest the extent to which the parliament first addressed these matters in 1992. When I spoke on this matter before, I mentioned the discussions I had with former Minister Hand about the way in which this issue ought to be dealt with and the view the opposition held at that time that to retrospectively validate unlawful imprisonment was something that ought not be a course lightly embarked upon. We put the view to the government that it was more appropriate to do what was done in other areas quite frequently; that is, where a damages claim might well be founded, we came to the view that, if the courts found there was an entitlement to damages, it was appropriate for the parliament to prospectively quantify that.

         That is a course that is followed in a whole range of areas of law. It is not alien for parliaments to quantify damages that courts might otherwise award. It happens in the workers compensation area. It certainly did not seem to us that that was an inappropriate way to go. The government has clearly come to the view—and it is expressed in the second reading speech—that, because of other provisions in the constitution, while the states might be able to quantify damages, the Commonwealth cannot because of the just term provisions in our constitution. That is the reason why they are asking us to approve this retrospective legislation.

         In dealing with this matter, one needs to realise that, notwithstanding our on-balance view that this bill should pass, the courts, when they come to deal with it, may well have another close look at the way in which the government deals with this question. The government's drafting needs to be such that every `i' has been dotted and every `t' crossed. It is well known in the law that, if the court finds that the legislation on this occasion is flawed, it would read it down because of its retrospective nature. The government had better get it right, because if it does not have it right it may well fail again.

         It is interesting that the justification in relation to this turns on the view that the legislative amendments can be classed as curative. The parliamentary secretary's second reading speech says that curative legislation retrospectively corrects defects discovered in the law and its administration and restores what was previously thought by all parties to be the status quo. It is interesting to read the parliamentary secretary's justification for this statement. If it is genuinely curative, the courts might look at it as being appropriate retrospective legislation. The government is very anxious to bring the drafting within that ambit.

         There was a discussion about section 54RA and, of course, the impact of the former section 88. For the sake of completeness I would like to draw attention to some comments I offered on the previous occasion in relation to the operation of section 88. I dare say the courts will look at the understanding of this matter very carefully because, administratively or otherwise, it seemed to me that the sections that were drafted were not drafted originally in a form that was even meant to comprehend a situation of the type to which it was ultimately applied.

         I think that is the point that needs to be understood. Essentially, section 88—as I emphasised on the previous occasion—was put in the legislation to deal with stowaways, people who might be apprehended in the port and be delivered back to their boat when it was about to depart the port. That is why we have this concept, which the court picked up in this instance when it was asked to look at section 88, of the custody of certain persons during the stay of a vessel in port. That is why the section was drawn that way. It was never really envisaged that there might be a situation in which people would sail in in a boat which might sink when in territorial waters or might have to be destroyed for quarantine reasons and not be there to sail away on at the end of the day. Asylum seekers were never expecting to sail away at the end of that process. Yet that is what the legislation was designed to deal with.

         It ought to be quite clear to everybody—I am sure it will be clear to the courts when they address this matter—that the government came to a section of the legislation and said, `Maybe we can get it to fit the particular case.' It was not a section which was put in the legislation because somebody had an innocent view that there was a defect in the law or its administration that was later discovered, nor was it a matter of restoring what was previously thought by all to be the status quo. It was never that.

         I can understand why the government is saying what it is. It knows the legislation is flawed. We are going to let it go through so it can be tested by the courts. It is an on balance view and the courts are going to look at it; but they are going to look at it not against what is written in the second reading speech but against the context of the whole debate: including the explanatory memorandum and the history of this matter. I think in that context we will yet see some very interesting litigation emerging from the legislation before us.

         As I said right at the beginning of my remarks, the opposition is always very cooperative in these matters and always wanting to offer helpful advice. These are matters that could have been addressed in a timely fashion before the courts ever got into the business of looking at them, if the government had turned its mind to it. The situation is no different in relation to this matter than it is in the belated way the government is asking us to look at other matters where it could have acted earlier, dealt with them in a timely fashion and produced a very different outcome from that which we are experiencing today. If the government had acted promptly to warn people, particularly in southern China, about the nature of our law and expectations, many people may not have embarked upon hazardous courses of travel to Australia, putting their lives and the lives of their families at risk.

         If the government had shown some competence in dealing with these matters, we would not be looking at legislation of this sort today which breaches principles that we have all held to be significant over a long period of time and we would not have been addressing some of the other legislation in the migration area that we have seen. As I say, this legislation will be acceded to by the opposition, but it is an on-balance view taken against the background of the circumstances in which the community has concerns about the potential costs that are involved. We have determined to accede to it.

         —The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 before us has been debated before. In fact, the issues in relation to this matter have been discussed almost ad nauseam. The reason it comes back before us is that the bill has been challenged in the High Court. Let me just indicate that when section 54RA was enacted it was considered that the provision had been validly made. A number of High Court decisions since then on the ambit of the just terms requirement in the acquisitions power of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution have raised doubts about the constitutional validity of section 54RA. That is the reason for this bill.

         In this context it is important that we as a nation move to a bipartisan position with respect to dealings on the refugee issue. When I was chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, of which the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) was deputy chairman, with the exception of one issue which had to do with the Chinese students question, there was a total bipartisan approach to the question of refugees relating to matters in this bill.

         Both with the issues which arose then dealing with the very difficult question of the Cambodian refugees and with the questions that have now come up in relation to the Chinese boat people, it is very important that we not only act consistently with our humanitarian obligations but also protect the national interest.

         We need to try to get into place an understanding with other governments—I commend the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) for the understandings which have been reached with the government of China—that we are interested in a refugee program that is based primarily on people being selected from refugee camps where they have been clearly identified as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Everyone in the region will then clearly know that Australia's position is that you cannot jump the queue simply by getting into a boat and coming here but that you have to have genuine refugee concerns. Those concerns are best met by the processing of people in refugee camps in those third countries.

         Australia's refugee reputation is still tremendously high with respect to our overseas program. There has been some attempt to dent our reputation by arguments on the treatment of the boat people. But let me say this with respect to that: the current minister, Senator Bolkus, inherited a situation with respect to the Cambodian refugees. It is true to say that the vast majority of those people have been accommodated one way or other. That is to say, they have either been asked to go on a special program, the one year turnaround program with Cambodia, or they have been accepted here. Very few have been totally rejected—a few have but it is not a large number.

         I want to commend the minister for the work that he has done to deal with this very sensitive issue over the last two years in a very positive way. But, of course, the appearance of refugees from China has raised fundamental questions with respect to our whole refugee policy. Although it is clear that we do sympathise with those people who consider that they can have an economic and social life here superior to that which they would have in China, the reality is that that is not a sufficient condition to be a refugee because if we accepted all those people who wanted a better economic and social existence, we would literally be faced with many millions of people wanting to come to Australia—many millions of people.

That is the most important factor. In fact, genuine refugees will be looked after, and that should be the basis of our policy. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

        Mr Speaker, the House will recall that the government's original legislation on this matter was debated at great length here during August and September last year. It has since been the subject of one of the longest debates ever conducted on the floor of the Senate. In the course of that debate, an alliance of convenience between coalition and Greens (WA) senators produced so many changes that the bill as adopted in that chamber bears no resemblance to the legislation which this House agreed upon.

         The central premises of the bill—the policy foundation on which the indigenous land fund was to be established and administered—were overturned in an unfortunate display of cynical parliamentary opportunism. The damage was inflicted on the government's legislation despite an enormous effort on our part to find common ground, to reach a position that would allow this initiative of great national importance to proceed. Some 121 amendments were proposed during the Senate debate, most of them by coalition and Green senators trading support for each other's proposals. At the end of the Senate's first consideration of the bill it had agreed to 67 amendments and one request for an amendment.

         The government accepted 21 of those amendments on the floor of the Senate, despite having reservations about many of them.

         Given that outcome, the government was obliged to consider its options, in particular whether it could proceed at all with a land fund so crippled by the Senate. Because the measure is of such fundamental importance to all Australians, we have decided to ask the parliament to have a second look at it. I will briefly describe the basis upon which the government will do that.

         On 28 November 1994, at the end of its marathon debate on the original bill, the Senate appointed a select committee to inquire into the acceptability of its own amendments among indigenous Australians. In all the circumstances—with the Senate declining to deal further with the amendments, and the request rejected and returned to it by the House of Representatives—the government considers that there has been a failure to pass the bill within the meaning of section 57 of the constitution.

I hope reason will prevail in that place on this occasion and that the land fund, which we had hoped and expected would be up and running by now, will be able to get started as soon as possible. The government is encouraged somewhat on this point by the comments of the chairman of the Senate select committee after its report was tabled on 9 January this year. He suggested that there was no longer any point in `forcing' the disputed amendments in the Senate. As Senator Campbell's views have not been contradicted it is to be hoped that his view will prevail—and prevail soon—among those opposite.

The context for these measures is a pivotal part of this government's long-term agenda—that is, the promotion of reconciliation between indigenous Australians and other Australians; the national pursuit of greater understanding, greater respect, for our indigenous heritage; a just accounting for the wrongs done to indigenous Australians since European occupation of this country; and a coordinated campaign across all tiers of government to address the environmental and primary health problems faced by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.

         Little more than two years ago, our progress towards reconciliation received an enormously important fillip from the judiciary.

         The Native Title Act added huge symbolic weight to the Mabo decision. It announced that the Australian people supported the great principles of justice inherent in the court's decision and were determined to see them applied. But the application was limited to those people who were able to prove a continuing association with their land. Many indigenes were, of course, dispossessed of their land in earlier periods and many remain on the margins of this country's economic, social and cultural life. The Native Title Act, though great in significance and utility, cannot by its nature solve the problems of dispossession and alienation.

         As an example of the first category, the coalition and the Greens would jeopardise the very purpose of the legislation through the combined effect of two sets of amendments. In one—amendments numbered 6 to 17 in the document I have tabled—they would have the ILC allow individuals and trusts to own property acquired through the land fund. This government, like previous governments, believes holdings by indigenous corporations best reflect traditional forms of land ownership, and also provide more reliable guarantees of accountability.

         In the other, No. 32, the coalition and Green senators would allow grantees of land fund acquisitions to dispose of them at any time without the consent of the ILC. This proposition alone militates against the central aim of building up an indigenous land base and maintaining it for future generations. When combined with the relaxation of the requirement about the form of ownership, it has the real potential to undermine the very purpose of the legislation.

         The combined amendments give individuals as well as community organisations the legal entitlement to sell off land acquired through the fund.

         The Senate's argument for individual tenure is that, in their dealings with land, indigenous people should have the same rights, including the freedom to dispose of property, as all other Australians. But this argument is spurious because indigenous people do have those same rights. As individuals they can go and buy land like anyone else. The acquisitions envisaged by the bill are a commitment made by the Australian people over and above those individual rights and are for the specific purpose of restoring part of a lost heritage.

         This amendment would shift the focus of the ILC's operations from the fundamental objective of building an indigenous land base.

         The amendments seeking to confuse the real objective of the ILC with other questions like health and education are also in another category of amendment which the government finds objectionable.

         A number of the coalition-Green amendments fall into this category. Whereas the government's bill was drafted to give a reasonable degree of discretion and flexibility to the corporation, the amendments seek to tie its hands with prescriptive formulas to be applied to its decision making at every turn. An example of this approach is the coalition's amendment No. 4, which proposes that, when making decisions on land acquisition, the ILC should give priority to those communities who are `most severely dispossessed'. The potential for conflict and for lengthy delays while disputes are settled should have been obvious to the proponents of that criterion from the outset.

         I notice that even the coalition-Green majority on the Senate select committee was struck by the amount of criticism this proposal drew from indigenous organisations and individuals.

         The committee's solution, however—a form of words which would still seek to rank degrees of disadvantage in terms of access to land—clearly fails to overcome the objection to the original amendment.

         Several other amendments would have a similar damaging effect on the workability of the land fund scheme. These include the requirement for the ILC to consult traditional owners before purchasing any land, more onerous provisions related to the development of national and regional strategies, and a separate financial allocation for the ILC's administrative expenses. Government ministers explained in great detail in the Senate the difficulties that would be caused by these amendments, and these arguments still hold.

         Remember, the bill had been on the table of this House since 30 June last year. Before that, the bill had been drafted in consultation with a variety of indigenous organisations—including some who disagreed with parts of our proposals and who later briefed our opponents. Yet by October-November our opponents had failed to produce a coherent response. Instead of putting thoughtful alternatives to our proposals we saw them looking for excuses to sabotage a major legislative achievement.

         If nothing else, this episode reveals the double standards of the coalition and Green senators who made up the majority of that select committee. It was they who accused the government of inadequate consultation, despite the fact that our consultation and negotiation process on the land fund began during the formulation of the Native Title Act. In relation to the specifics of this particular bill, negotiations started in April last year—and the bill was not debated, even in this House, until the end of August. The same people, having consulted hurriedly after they acted in the parliament, then chose to ignore the outcome of their consultations.

         We all know that the coalition parties were in a state of total confusion in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs when this bill was before the parliament last year. The then Leader of the Opposition, winking and nodding at the reactionaries of his Western Australian branch, had suggested that a coalition government would `review' the Native Title Act itself. He went straight from Perth to central Australia where he revealed to Aboriginal communities that not only was he ambivalent in his support for native title, he also lacked a grasp of his own party's policies on indigenous affairs.

We have a very important overseas refugee program which targets people who are selected in a very careful fashion from tens of thousands of potential applicants from the refugee camps.

         The only question in relation to those refugees is the quota we can take each year. The quotas per year have been at significant levels. They were even retained at reasonable levels when immigration in general has been reduced. When we have cut immigration in general we have not reduced the numbers coming in from overseas under the refugee program. I think that means that our humanitarian standing in the refugee area is high internationally.

It is the product of a complacent government that presents the parliament and the public with sloppy legislation and poorly drafted documents.

         In the past six years, around 1,700 people from Asian countries have arrived illegally in Australia by boat. Almost half of these arrived during 1994, and, since June, nine boats bearing more than 700 people from the southern Chinese port city of Beihai landed at Darwin in the biggest influx since the waves of the Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s. Many of these boats were large, solid fishing vessels. Rather than braving the seas in coastal craft, these refugees came in boats equipped with twin diesels and advanced satellite navigation systems.

         Australian liberals should be proud of the humane way the Fraser government reacted to the first Indo-Chinese refugee crisis. If we want to make sure that Australia will still be prepared to receive genuine refugees in the future it is important to make sure that public opinion will not turn against these programs because of the admission of people with less than genuine claims to refugee status.

         The coalition, despite its concern over the retrospective elements, is not opposing this legislation. However, that does not mean that we will let up for one minute in our attack on this government and Senator Bolkus for the way the refugee and immigration policy has been handled. As I have already said, today's debate has been brought about by the policy failures of the government.

         Let us compare one group with refugees. In the last six months of 1994, 700 boat people arrived. Each year around 14,000 legal arrivals overstay their visas. I have already mentioned the cost involved here: $30 million, $60 million or as high as $190 million, depending on how we look at the problem. Boat people entering Australia are detained. People who arrive legally and then overstay are given bridging visas—if they are caught, that is—that can still allow them to work or receive benefits illegally while their status is determined. It could be said that an entirely discriminatory system that imposes significant costs on the Australian taxpayer is in operation here.

         As I have said today, this debate is a product of bad legal advice and poorly drafted legislation. A new refugee wave, created in part by the mixed messages this government has sent out, has been instrumental in influencing the coalition's response to this recent amended legislation. Yet the minister has waited until the situation has reached crisis point before acting firmly to stop the matter. One can only speculate on Senator Bolkus's priorities.

         It has become public knowledge over recent months that the minister wanted the removal of as many as 20 people from the speaker's list at the population outlook conference that the Bureau for Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research held in Adelaide last week, a figure finally reduced to six when the impracticability of this course of action sank in. Interestingly enough for this debate, one of those people purged from the conference was Ms Margaret Piper from the Refugee Council of Australia. Is this how the minister deals with views opposed to his own?

         It is grotesque for a minister to be punishing and silencing his critics. It becomes farcical when we see him doing it in such a ham-fisted way. Under Senator Bolkus the situation has arisen where we need to seriously question the administration of immigration policy in this country. It is bad enough that the actual laws and regulations themselves contain so many loopholes or ambiguities because their implementation was rushed so a government could parade them at election time that they are in need of constant amendment. But when blatant censorship and ministerial cronyism occurs, then there is real cause for concern.

         Appeals by would-be refugees against departmental rulings are heard by the Refugee Review Tribunal. For other immigration applicants, appeals are heard by the Immigration Review Tribunal, a supposedly independent body set up in 1989 to review the merits of decisions made by the department of immigration and with the power to have those overturned. At the moment, there is no question over the integrity of the decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal. It is just as well when we can see quite clearly today some of the results of disputes over refugee regulations.

         —My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. In 1973 the Whitlam government promised Aboriginal health equity by 1984. In 1983 the Hawke government promised, as part of its election strategy, to have all Aborigines adequately housed in six years, by 1989. Yet yesterday the Prime Minister conceded that the $232 million spent on the Aboriginal health strategy had been wasted. Three weeks ago the Deputy Prime Minister said it would take six years to house all Aborigines adequately. How can anyone believe anything Labor says on Aboriginal health when all its promises and projections over 20 years have failed?

         —But it would seem to me that the wrong way to go about improving the circumstances of Aboriginal people is to denigrate them, deny them access to land and destroy the services that are provided for them. The Prime Minister made a very genuine point in that interview. I saw the interview and the transcript. In the context, what the Prime Minister said was that the funds that we have applied in Aboriginal affairs have not had the desired effect that we would all wish. That is true. That has been acknowledged by a wide range of commentators. I want to point out that this serious matter requires cooperation; it requires bipartisan support. Most of these services that are required to be provided, whether water supply, electricity, sewerage or health services, are the responsibility of state and territory governments, assisted by national policy from the federal government. Most of the state and territory governments at the moment are conservative governments which, on the face of it, do not give a damn about the plight of Aboriginal people.

         I urge members opposite not to misquote and misrepresent the views of the Prime Minister who, conspicuously, does care about the Aboriginal people in this country and, conspicuously, will act to improve their lot. Rather, we should acknowledge as a community—as the member for O'Connor never does—that the Aboriginal people deserve special attention and assistance from all of us. That should not take the form of cheap political points.

It was a decision which was greeted at the time with enthusiasm particularly by the media with some justification in that Australian defamation laws as they are currently written are tilted too much in favour of personal reputation and not enough in terms of allowing free public debate. However, any belief which may be taken from that decision or from comment at that time that the decision has in fact introduced an American style of defamation law in this country is quite mistaken and any examination of the decision will show that.

Allegations were apparently made about authorship of a book and extracts from a book were given when no such book had been written by the candidate.

         Even though there was great discussion in the High Court on the leading United States defamation case, New York Times v Sullivan—the case which establishes in United States law that actual malice or recklessness or disregard of the truth must be established by a plaintiff bringing a defamation action—the High Court decision specifically rejected that approach. Indeed, in the Theophanous case, once the falsity of a statement was established and it was defamatory, it would then be up to the defendant to establish, firstly, that the defendant was unaware of the falsity of the material that was published; secondly, that it did not publish the material recklessly—that is, not caring whether the material was true or false—and, thirdly, that the publication was reasonable in the circumstances.

The High Court decision does not give any encouragement to that sort of view.

         What we do need is proper defamation law reform. Such a question is being pursued by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. There will be further development on this reform following the release in April of a report by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. I can assure the honourable member that even a strict following of the High Court decision lends no comfort to those in the Liberal Party or elsewhere who think that they can make any allegation that they would like, make any defamatory statement they would like and undertake any campaign technique that they would like and believe that there ought not be appropriate recourse.

         Of course, the compliance cost reduction is quite an important element of tax policy to try to ensure that those who have to pay any tax can do so at minimal cost to themselves in terms of complying with their requirements under that tax. In order to achieve that, we have taken out various items from FBT altogether—such items as laptop and portable computers, protective clothing, briefcases, calculators, tools of trade, subscriptions to trade and professional journals, airport lounge memberships, business related software, electronic diaries, and corporate credit card membership fees. All these things supplied by employers to their employees will no longer require attempts to try to assess what the private benefit was from those items and to apply FBT to it. In addition, car phones and mobile phones will not be subject to FBT where private use is only minor or incidental to the primary business use.

         As the member for Eden-Monaro mentioned, the package will also allow a much greater use of a statutory formula for calculating benefits subject to FBT and other measures which will greatly reduce record keeping requirements. These changes will dramatically reduce the compliance costs associated with the FBT.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In addition to those compliance cost changes, I announced two other changes. One was to allow FBT exemption for taxis provided between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. for direct journeys between work and home. That was in response to a large number of requests for consideration to be given for that in order for employers to look after the safety of their employees, and we accepted that. And also in relation to car parking we have removed most car parking benefits in non-CBD areas. Any employer who is not within a kilometre of a commercial car park charging more than $5 a day will no longer be liable for FBT on that benefit.

         That basically will confine the FBT in very large part to CBD areas; in other words, concentrating on fairly high value benefits rather than including a lot of smaller ones. The effect of that is that a large number of employers will now be completely exempted from liability for FBT on the car parking benefit, and many will be exempted from the FBT in entirety.

         I also mention, as the questioner raised the point, that the cost of all this is $120 million in the first year and $90 million thereafter. That is essentially the cost of meeting the car parking and taxi changes. To cover that cost we have increased the statutory formula for calculation of the fringe benefits tax for the use of a car which is available to employees or employers to use, instead of having their employees keep records. The modest increase in this formula will reduce the concessionality that now exists in that formula, which is a widely recognised concessionality. That is, by using the formula you can get a much lower FBT cost to the companies than would be the case if they kept records and paid FBT on the private use. So it is concessional. It is widely seen as that. By some increase in it, we are reducing that concessionality and covering the cost.

         I think this is overall a very sensible package and was seen as such by various commentators, although it was criticised by some, including of course the opposition, particularly through the shadow Treasurer and through the shadow minister for small business, the member for Pearce, who criticised the increase in the formula and said it had no rationale except to raise money.

        And the opposition says there is no rationale for this change in the concessionality of this element of the fringe benefits tax; that it is simply a tax raising measure! Those opposite think it is fine for there to be this kind of loophole and for people in well-paid positions to be able to get these large fringe benefits in a way which is only very lightly taxed under the present arrangements.

         —The issue raised by the honourable member is, indeed, a serious one for world financial markets involving the collapse of a major British bank, Barings, in circumstances which are now well known to every member in the House. In responding to this question it is appropriate to say at the outset that, so far as we can gather, the failure of Barings is not likely to have any significant, direct implications for Australia. Barings has only a small presence in the Australian financial markets. It has part ownership of the corporate adviser Baring Brothers Burrows and owns 20 per cent of the stockbrokers McIntosh. While Barings' interest in both bodies may well need to be sold, this is not expected to have any significant impact on the business or financial standing of either body.

         The use of derivatives is an increasingly common feature of financial markets around the world. They are essentially financial products designed to enable the better management of risks related to the future price of commodities or other financial instruments. Banks account for around 90 per cent of derivatives trading in Australia, but there are three regulatory bodies involved with derivatives. Not only are banks involved—and of course the Reserve Bank is the regulatory body there—but also superannuation funds and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission are involved in the regulation of that area, and there is also the general use of derivatives by companies and the Australian Securities Commission is involved in relation to that area.

These studies have generally concluded that the primary responsibility for the prudent management of a firm with derivatives operations lies with the management and board of the firm itself and that the regulator cannot be expected to take on that burden. These studies have also suggested guidelines for best practice in the management of derivatives and have stressed the need for regulators to be vigilant in ensuring firms have adequate risk management systems in place and that these systems adapt to the rapidly changing nature of financial markets.

         I have written to the Victorian minister asking for her assurance on these points. These proposed amalgamations, in my view, have the potential to be very damaging in terms of reducing the quality and access to services for Victorian women. It is pretty typical of that government. Time and time again it is taking the food mixer to health policy and community services generally. When it is under any pressure it simply throws everything in together, mixes it all up and hopes that the outcome will be a sensible one.

         Those in Victoria have, in a sense, the disease of the coalition; that is, they do not have a health policy; they do not have a community services policy; they have a few catchcries—words like `effectiveness' and `efficiency'—and they pay no mind at all to the outcome in this case for the women of Victoria. Those in Victoria apparently suffer from policy paralysis as do those in the opposition here. I have indicated to the Victorian minister that, unless I get some reassurances on this question, the Commonwealth share of these funds may well have to be re-evaluated. We may go ahead and directly put the money into these programs if the Victorian government is not prepared to support what is an excellent program. I hope those opposition members from Victoria will pick up the phone, ring Jeff Kennett and Marie Tehan and say, `This is not good enough. We too are interested in the health of Victorian women, and we are not prepared to see such a splendid service go down the drain.'

         —My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, at the meeting of creditors of Mr Bond yesterday the Australian Tax Office was listed as being owed in excess of $21 million. As a member of the government that had its hand on the levers in the 1980s and 1990s when this debt was racked up, that failed to enact legislation tight enough to prevent gifts to bankrupts being treated as income and that basked in the glow of the wealth splash programs of the Bonds and the Skases, how do you explain this loss of $21 million to those taxpayers who are about to receive more economic pain by way of tax hikes? How do you explain these extraordinary events to the many small business people who are pursued by the tax office into bankruptcy and beyond for far smaller amounts or, Treasurer, is it simply a case that under Labor there is one rule for the Prime Minister's rich mates, the members of Labor's fundraising arm, the Curtin Foundation, and another for those who suffered most in this recession they didn't have to have—that is, the ordinary Australian taxpayer? Treasurer, where is your conscience on this issue?

         —My conscience is fine. It is absolutely untroubled about this issue—absolutely untroubled. It is not the government that lost the money; it is not the government that sent the business broke—it is Alan Bond. We are one of the very many creditors of Mr Bond who are not going to get repaid. Mr Speaker, it is an absurdity. What seems to be lying behind this question is some suggestion that the government is at fault because Mr Bond has not paid his taxes. Obviously we do everything in our power to make sure that taxpayers meet their obligations and, certainly in the case of Mr Bond, along with everybody else, we will pursue that to the fullest under the law. But it is an absurdity to suggest that, because you have a person who is bankrupt and who is unable to meet his obligations, it is our fault that he cannot meet his obligations. What kind of a society do you think this is? It is just an absurd, utterly ridiculous question.

         It is the case that the government tries to ensure all the time that all taxpayers meet their tax obligations and that we cover any loopholes that might appear in the law from time to time. Recently, in fact on Sunday, I announced a change to the tax law which is meant to ensure that bankrupts who have their bankruptcyies annulled are not able then to claim previous losses which are involved in their bankruptcy against future income for tax purposes. There was a possibility that some such situation could have existed.

         The announcement that I made on Sunday night was intended to ensure that that cannot happen, so I think that is an example of the determination of the government to ensure that the possibility of what I am sure everyone here in the public would see as a tax rip-off cannot occur. We saw that possibility; we covered it.

         Last July Australis announced that it believed it had secured exclusive rights to the series. However, it subsequently advised the Broadcasting Authority and myself that in fact an associated company, Prime Sports, held the rights and that in accordance with the anti-siphoning rules and the Broadcasting Services Act its pay TV licensee company would only secure those rights after a free to air broadcaster had got the free to air rights. In January Australis then told us that its company had in fact secured the rights and that it believed that it was not bound to abide by the rules. It claimed that its company had secured the rights before the siphoning list took effect.

         Putting aside for one moment the question as to whether the broadcasting authority and I were misled by Australis in its contradictory statements, pay TV was always intended to increase the diversity of programming. Pay TV was never intended to force Australian viewers to pay to watch sporting events that they have traditionally seen for free. The parliament's clear intention in the Broadcasting Services Act has been to ensure that sport does not migrate from free to air to pay, and that is certainly the government's view.

We think that the viewers out there should still continue to have access to those sporting events.

         —Since exclusivity is the stumbling block, I have called on Channel 9 to agree to simultaneous live coverage of this event on the basis that this will not set a precedent for future negotiations. This is a concession which Australis granted in the Senate committee appearances last week. Australis made it clear that this is the only event where there will be an argument about whether or not it secured these rights before the siphoning list was finalised. On that basis, I think there is room for compromise on both sides to try to reach agreement so Australian fans out there can get a chance to watch this cricket event. That, of course, is the highest priority for those on this side of the House, even though the opposition thinks that all sport can go to pay TV and be unavailable to the free to air viewers out there.

         —There are two reports which I am sure will interest members, one of which is from the International Narcotics Control Board. It is part of our United Nations obligations to provide data to that body about drug seizures in the region. That report shows that, unfortunately, we still have very substantial and, indeed, in some cases growing problems in the region, including Australia. It is important for members to note that countries in our region are increasingly becoming transit points and risk becoming centres for laundering profits.

         So we have an environment in which our young people, particularly, are likely to be subject to increased pressure. We have seen increases—or reports of increases—in heroin abuse and cocaine abuse; increases in some very strong forms of marijuana; and abuse of amphetamines, particularly the hallucinogenic derivative MDMA. That view from the INCB report is confirmed by a report from my own department entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Statistics on drug abuse in Australia
         </emphasis>
         which paints a similar picture in relation to illicit drug abuse and drug use. It is particularly worrying that the report says—

        I think it is worth saying, however, that a lot of effort has been put into this issue by responsible ministers—not just health ministers, but by justice and police ministers. The International Narcotics Control Board had this to say about Australia's anti-drug effort:

        Although the problem is still a very serious one and we cannot step back from it, I think we have some reason to be pleased with that cooperative effort. The Commonwealth and state agencies involved deserve some credit for curtailing a very serious problem.

         I am pleased to say that, although we continue to have problems with illicit drug use, my own department's work shows that, in licit areas, alcohol consumption per person has fallen 13 per cent—although medium and high risk drinking is still a problem; hence our Alcohol Go Easy campaign. Tobacco, of course, is still the major cause of preventable drug related mortality, but again we have seen total consumption falling 25 per cent. I think it is very important that all members understand the problem that we face and work with those agencies to prevent any deterioration.

         —I know that this is something likely to excite passions on the other side generally, but let's look this in the face. In Australia we have an excellent record of dealing with HIV-AIDS—an excellent record, the envy of the world. One of the reasons we have been so successful in containing the spread of that disease is that we faced it squarely and frankly. We have not pretended that certain practices were not occurring and we have not taken a morally superior line.

         That has, in the past, been a bipartisan approach. State and Commonwealth governments, Liberal and Labor, have said, `Let's address the problem. Let's not get sidetracked by the fact that we know there are varieties of opinion and varieties of moral positions in this community.'

         Let's face the fact, for example—if you want to talk about anal that in terms of absolute numbers more women will have anal sex than will homosexual couples. In percentage terms, certainly, the number is lower, but absolutely speaking, given all the surveys that have been done on this question—those opposite might want to duck it—at any time, anywhere between 10 and 15 per cent of women—or heterosexual couples—will have anal sex. I could say, as minister, `I don't want to know about that. I don't think we should tell young people about the risks they are taking if they have anal sex.' I prefer to take the view that they need to be informed.

         What all the evidence shows very clearly is that if people are informed, and informed in a way that they can accept and understand—remember who we are talking to, 18- to 35-year-olds, young adults—they are less likely to be sexually active. People who are informed delay sexual gratification, delay their entry into relationships and are less likely to experiment with unsafe sex practices. Ignorance is a recipe for death, and as a minister I am not prepared to stand by and see that rate of sexually transmitted disease and, in many cases, death resulting therefrom.

         —I thank the honourable member for the question. I think I should begin by responding to a couple of things that are not affected by Mr Bond's discharge from bankruptcy. Firstly, nothing affects the fact that Mr Bond is currently facing criminal charges under the Western Australian Companies Code, alleging that he and others acted dishonestly, as officers of Bell Resources Ltd.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, I should point out that nothing in his discharge affects the Australian Federal Police's continuing investigation into the possible commission by Mr Bond of criminal offences under the Bankruptcy Act by failing to fully disclose his assets and properties to the trustee of his bankrupt estate. The significance of that, of course, is that if Mr Bond is subsequently found to have failed to have fully and adequately disclosed those resources, not only would he face the possibility of further criminal charges but also the release that he has obtained from his bankruptcy could be re-opened.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I think there is no doubt that members of this House, and certainly the government, are well aware of community concerns over the size of Mr Bond's offer to creditors to accept less than 1c in the dollar, but that decision is properly, under our bankruptcy laws, one for his creditors alone. It is not the role of government to supersede that of the large banks and the other large financial institutions to which Mr Bond owed money. At the end of the day, the question of every bankruptcy is for those owed the money, and to secure a release there must be a vote of not less than 50 per cent of the number of those owed and not less than 75 per cent of the value of the debts owed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I have heard some criticisms in recent days that amount to the proposition that there should be a fundamental re-writing of the principles that underpin our bankruptcy laws. I want to reject that entirely, because there are two things we seek to do with bankruptcy law: firstly, to provide the full resources necessary to allow trustees in bankruptcy to clawback assets that are held by bankrupts and to make them available to creditors; but, secondly, also to make sure that the many people who come before bankruptcy procedures have a chance to make a fresh start and to put behind them their bankruptcy processes. That is, of course, so important because so many of those who try to set up small businesses in our community do so taking an acknowledged risk. Not everybody who starts up business in this community succeeds, and there has to be a proper process that allows those who seek to enrich themselves in the private enterprise sector, but who fail, to set aside ultimately the burden of those debts and move on to a new life.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So we have two objectives: firstly, to make sure that creditors are paid the moneys that are held by the bankrupt; and, secondly, that in the end, after that has been done, a bankrupt can move on. I reject entirely the sort of suggestions that have been made, I think bandied around by the Leader of the National Party, that we need to re-appraise those principles. It would be precisely the people in rural Australia, small business people and the like, who, if we approach this issue vindictively, without reflection about the second leg of the objective under the bankruptcy legislation, who would suffer most.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is true, and I think objective commentators would say, that Australia's bankruptcy laws are amongst the toughest and the fairest in the world. We have had substantial changes from time to time as reports have come to us, and there has been a substantial consultative process amongst those involved with insolvency and the community as a whole. The act underwent landmark reforms in 1991, and further reforms announced last year will be brought forward shortly. The 1991 amendments, for example, gave trustees significant power to overturn distributions of property which were intended to defraud creditors or payments by the bankrupt which favoured one creditor over another.

         All the weapons that are given to trustees to enable funds and assets to be clawed back are in place, but at the end of the day the decision when to draw the line and to say that the investigations and the attempts to collect assets from a debtor have been exhausted is one for those who are owed the money. That is not to say that this government has been insensitive to Mr Ramsay in the requests that have been made of it.

         Under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act a trustee in bankruptcy can approach the Minister for Justice for assistance if needed to finance some components of an investigation.

         I also want to comment briefly on some criticisms that have been made, I think, by Mr Gavin Rezos, the legal counsel for the Hong Kong bank, that the clawback provision be extended from the maximum period of five years that now exists to ten.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Just by way of background information, the way clawback works now is, essentially, that there is a normal period which extends only to five years if the person has been insolvent at the time when a debt was entered into. But if a debt was entered into knowingly with the intention to defraud creditors, then it can be traced back at any time. To suggest that we go back 10 years, whilst it sounds superficially attractive, and apply that, without any safeguards of the kind that I think need to be built into this legislative provision, and the kinds that are, would be immensely unfair to many ordinary Australians.

Any system that reaches back 10 years in those kinds of circumstances, as some people are proposing, I think, is a vindictive and unhelpful response to this whole debate. Whilst every suggestion that is put forward constructively needs to be looked at, I hesitate to approach this on the basis of a knee-jerk reaction to a particular case.

         Finally, I make this point: Mr Bond has said, in response to those proceedings that were taken against him, that his creditors would have been better off if there were a provision under Australian law which was akin to chapter 11 of the United States insolvency law. Such a provision currently exists under the Australian Corporations Law. Part 5.3(a) of the Corporations Law commenced on 23 June 1993 and provides for voluntary administrations, which are as effective and as simple as those which exist under chapter 11 of the United States code.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. As chair of the parliamentary banking, finance and public administration committee, he has a very keen interest in this issue, as I have. Consumers have raised many questions in recent months about the service they are getting from our banking system. So earlier this month I held a meeting with Australia's peak consumer and community groups, which the member for Calare also attended. We did that to discuss the impact of bank fees and bank closures on their constituents. Perhaps Mr Argus does not quite understand the depth of anger in the community and amongst consumers about the rising bank fees.

         —I have seen reports that Mr Argus has suggested that the banks' social responsibility is an issue for government alone. I can assure him that that was not the view of those present at the meeting. Indeed, it was a view of all those consumer and community groups represented that banks also have a definite social responsibility. The clear message was that all Australians have the right to access our banking system. Neither the government nor the consumer or community groups I met are advocating a return to the days of regulation but what the government is addressing, through the PSA inquiry in particular, is how we best work with the banks to meet consumer concerns about bank fees and charges. That does not mean that the banks can just pass the buck. It is worth noting that in France the banks addressed this issue and in 1992 adopted as an industry a basic banking services charter to ensure that all members of the community could still utilise the banking system.

         Community groups and consumer groups tell me that that increasingly is not the case in Australia. Low income earners are finding that they simply cannot afford the rising bank fees, nor can they cope with diminishing access as a result of bank closures and so on. For instance, Chris Vevers from Disabled Peoples International said that it now costs some disabled people an extra $14 a month to use tellers because they cannot physically access ATMs and are forced to pay for personal services.

         I am very pleased to see that the Commonwealth Bank has announced that it is going to address these concerns with the introduction of ATMs with access for disabled people. That shows that, when consumers put their views to the banks and we discuss these things together, some of these concerns can be addressed—but there is still a long way to go. I will be meeting with consumer groups again later this month to discuss further issues of access and the concept of a basic banking product. I also urge those key consumer groups to make their own submissions to the PSA inquiry.

         —Mr Speaker, I understand that a temporary injunction has been granted to prevent the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Philippa Smith, a statutory office holder, from tabling a report to this parliament and that the matter will be heard later this week. Can you confirm that this is the case and can you advise whether this is the first occasion that this has occurred? I think it is fair to say that members on both sides of parliament are very concerned and disturbed at the interference by the court in the discharge by the Ombudsman of her statutory responsibilities to the parliament. Some members would assert, as I do, that the court has tripped over its responsibilities and a prima facie case of breach of privilege has been committed. I specifically ask whether you will examine the circumstances surrounding the injunction and determine whether, in your opinion, a breach of privilege has occurred, warranting a reference to the privileges committee. Further, do you deem it appropriate for the interests of all members of this House to be represented and protected at the hearing or will the Ombudsman be allowed to fend for herself at the hearing without the protection of parliament, and members' interests remain unrepresented?

Subsequently, the member for Moore (Mr Filing) asked whether members would be provided with access to Internet from within Parliament House. The Department of the House of Representatives is currently giving consideration to installing a small number of personal computer workstations on the House of Representatives side of Parliament House for accessing Internet. These workstations will be available to all members. They will not be connected to the parliamentary network, but access will be provided through a stand-alone server in the Parliamentary Library. This arrangement will ensure that security of the parliamentary network is not compromised.

         A similar arrangement is being provided to senators. Two personal computers will be installed on the Senate side of the building to allow senators access to Internet. These connections will also be independent of the parliamentary network. An interdepartmental working group has been established to investigate the issues and costs of providing Internet to personal computers connected to the parliamentary network. This will be a detailed study. It is expected that it will be some time before all issues are identified and satisfactorily resolved.

         I get very angry because, if you look at what has been said about Aboriginal health over the years, we have had a lot of promises. In 1973 the Whitlam government made promises about Aboriginal health. It was going to have Aboriginal health equity by 1984. Then, as part of Labor's platform in the run-up to the 1983 election, Susan Ryan, who was then shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, had this to say about Labor's program for 1983:

         Time and again we have had aims, promises, programs and projects, and the fact is that they have not worked.

We have failed time and again, and every time we fail it is that bit harder to succeed the next time.

        As a starting point, there is clearly a need for a detailed analysis of the Aboriginal health status in the light of health rather than just medical health. Based on this type of detailed analysis, it would be possible to undertake some more precise policy and program analysis. Incorporated in these programs should be specific targets with deadlines. They would not enable just only monitoring but also the evaluation of the assumptions on which those programs are based.

        Today I rang and spoke to a person who was on this commission—I will not give names. I asked, `What do you think about the Better Health Commission?', and was told, `I felt the exercise was more political than practical. I felt that we were to be seen to be doing something while the government was not actually doing anything at all.' That is 12 years of history in Aboriginal health—seen to be doing something while not doing anything at all.

         I want to illustrate the complete neglect in Aboriginal health by using the example of HIV. I want to do this because three months ago I was in Uganda. I went out with an aid agency. I travelled in southern Uganda and I would like to tell the House what I saw. I was in the Rakai province of southern Uganda which is the world epicentre of AIDS. I was travelling in remote parts of the country and about 2 o'clock one afternoon I visited a mud and reed hut that had eight people in it. The oldest was 16, the youngest was two. They had no parents—both parents died two years ago. They had no possessions whatsoever. To enable me to sit down, they borrowed a stool from a neighbour.

This is very curious because I actually dug up out of the parliamentary database her profile—and she was a state minister once. I will tell honourable members some things about the state of Western Australia. In 1992 Aboriginal persons in the south-west of Western Australia had a three per cent chance of finishing year 12. That is the lowest year 12 completion rate of any identifiable group of people in the Western world. And who was Minister for Education in Western Australia between 1988 and 1990? Who was Aboriginal affairs minister between 1989 and 1993? And who was Premier between 1990 and 1993? Carmen Lawrence.

The fact is that any Aboriginal community in the Western Desert, and there are nine of them, had between a 25 per cent and 40 per cent incidence of sexually transmitted diseases—that is not ever; that is at any one point in time—when she was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, when she was Premier, and when I visited in 1992 when she was both.

         I came into this place to put some issues on the record and to have a serious debate about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. I will proceed with that if the coalition will give me a chance. First of all, I want to make it clear that, as the Prime Minister has said, there are no overnight solutions to the problems confronting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is a national issue; it is not simply the responsibility of one level of government. As a nation an agreement was reached in 1990 between state, territory and Commonwealth ministers for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and for health on the national Aboriginal health strategy.

         As a result of that strategy, an additional $232 million was allocated over a five-year period to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. I came into the chamber today to answer the question, `Where has that money gone?' The fact is that $170 million out of the $232 million has gone to basic water, sewerage and infrastructure in those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. For example, Palm Island electrification cost $830,000. Water supply to that one community cost $5.7 million, and that was allocated in a bilateral agreement with the Commonwealth and the Queensland government. I mention these figures to demonstrate the massive cost of addressing the water, sewerage and infrastructure needs of people in those remote communities. To put in sewage disposal systems in the Torres Strait to a relatively tiny group of communities cost $850,000, and the allocation for the upgrade of the water supply cost $5 million. And it goes on. Water, sewerage, housing and basic infrastructure took $171 million from that $232 million.

         In relation to the remaining funds, there has been a very significant boost of the order of doubling or thereabouts the resources available for primary health. I am more than happy to table a document which provides detail about the increased services. In New South Wales as a result of that national Aboriginal health strategy there are three new services; there are major upgrades to four new services in the Northern Territory, five new Aboriginal medical services and two new clinics; there are six major upgrades of existing services in Queensland, four new services, one new clinic and three major upgrades.

         The national Aboriginal health strategy, however, has not achieved the outcome that I hope everyone in this parliament would want from future Commonwealth-state policies on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. The reason that we have not seen that change—and this is what we should be discussing today—can be found in the evaluation of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health strategy. It highlights a fundamental point. If I do only one thing in this House today, it is to ask the coalition to recognise and embrace this principle: unless we tackle the water, sewerage, housing, roads and basic living conditions in those remote communities, nothing will change.

         —I turn to a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, on which the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) served admirably. That committee came down with a unanimous report on the subject of access and equity. It found effectively that ATSIC on its own was never going to be able to tackle the backlog of water, sewerage, housing and infrastructure in remote communities. It unanimously found that mainstream agencies at the Commonwealth, state and territory levels were failing to fulfil their responsibilities to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Honourable members should have regard to page xvii of the report, which stated:

        The Committee was seriously concerned about the inadequate provision of essential services, such as water, electricity and sewerage to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In many instances, funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is being used to provide services that should have been provided by mainstream agencies . . .

This parliament has unanimously voted that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is one of the key issues to be addressed as a part of that reconciliation process.

         I will just come to some key issues and rebut some furphies that I think have abounded in the public debate over recent times. One of them relates to the question of whether ATSIC or the Department of Human Services and Health should be responsible for the funding of Aboriginal medical services. I want to say this about that debate: firstly, it is a matter which is currently the subject of discussions between ATSIC and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and other ministers. I believe now, as I have always believed, that there will be a negotiated outcome on that issue. Fundamentally important to this question is the wider agenda, and the wider agenda includes the role Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will play in the decision making process. Secondly, what will be done to achieve a coordinated approach and, to be very blunt about it, to ensure that the states and territories are not just passive observers of the national Aboriginal health strategy? Finally, we need to address the level of resources. It seems to me these are all key issues that have to be addressed.

         I conclude with a message not only for the coalition but for my side of politics and also for the wider Australian community, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I ask people to look and see what the Prime Minister said on the occasion of his recent visit to Hopevale. People should read the words carefully because, as I think the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) said earlier today, it is as important a statement for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their health as the Redfern statement was in relation to reconciliation and native title. It was a very important initiative by the Prime Minister to visit that Hopevale community, and I commend the statement to the House.

It asserts it spent $2 million. Yet we have got the Northern Territory minister responsible, Hatton, and this clown in the Senate saying that we should have TVs instead of water, and then you are up here arguing that it is our responsibility to provide infrastructure. Let us make it very clear. The responsibility for these housing infrastructure services belongs primarily with state and territory governments.

         I have already spoken about primary health care. Let me now talk about hospital care. I have here an article from the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Journal of Public Health
         </emphasis>
         Vol. 17, No. 4, December 1993. The article talks about hospitalisation in Queensland. It says that in Queensland there is clear evidence of higher morbidity and mortality rates in Aboriginal communities but that, paradoxically, whereas there are greater hospitalisation rates in discrete Aboriginal communities, there is lower expenditure per person on hospital services.

         How do you figure that out? The most disadvantaged group in the community, the people you have been saying deserve the best treatment, are being underfunded and underresourced in the Queensland hospital system by the Queensland government. I have already established, in the question of primary health care, that the Northern Territory government is underfunding Aboriginal people.

         We know the health status. We all accept that it is a tragedy, but we have to do something about it. Those who are failing to do something about it are primarily the state and territory governments. This government has accepted it as a priority. This government made funding available last year. This government has said that it will do more to address the particular issues of Aboriginal health.

         Over the last few weeks we have had the furphy about whether or not ATSIC has been the appropriate body to handle Aboriginal health funds. Let me say this: ATSIC deals with about 50-plus community based health services and its budget is around $50 million. That is all that ATSIC deals with in terms of primary health care. Who wears the rest of the responsibility? Which governments wear the responsibility for providing primary health care? State and territory governments, that's who! Who has failed to provide these services? State and territory governments, that's who! Who has failed to provide the services in terms of housing infrastructure?

         Let us not try to run away from it. Let us accept who is responsible here, instead of having these glib assertions coming across the table that the people who are responsible rest on the government benches here. We accept the responsibility to address the issue. But it is your mates in the states and territories—those people you would see as your soul brothers and sisters—who are failing to provide these services. The Northern Territory provides the most stark example. People trying to do research in relation to the state and territory governments find that the Northern Territory currently has no administrative mechanisms—note this—whereby data related to its expenditure on programs for Aboriginal people can be segregated. Understand that!

Unlike the honourable member, I am not someone who is a recent visitor to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I have been on this issue since the day I walked into this place. I have made an issue of Aboriginal health and my views have not changed one iota. I have continually argued—and will maintain—that the responsibility for the primary delivery of services to Aboriginal health is that of the state and territory governments. The people responsible for infrastructure spending are state and territory governments.

         The Northern Territory government says it spends $2 million on Aboriginal housing, of which $846,000 is from its untied budget. It has no problem at all spending $178 million on building a Supreme Court and a parliament for 25 members. That is where the Northern Territory government's priorities lie.

         For the last six months, the coalition and other groups have expressed concern over appointments that the minister has made to the Immigration Review Tribunal. A considerable body of evidence suggests that these may have been made for political reasons at the expense of more suitably qualified candidates.

         There are no legislative requirements governing the process of appointments, although the committee for the review of the system for review of migration decisions did make some recommendations on the matter in 1992. It suggested that the minister, while free to appoint whoever he or she liked, should widely advertise tribunal vacancies, should appoint a panel to interview candidates, and should report on their suitability based on publicly available criteria.

         Two of these, Mr Garth Head and Ms Lyn Kosky, were preselected Labor Party candidates for the Victorian parliament. A reappointed member, Mr Joe Italiano, was another preselected candidate. The principal Victorian tribunal member, Mr Michael Clothier, was replaced by a Ms Michelle Scott, a former Labor Party staffer without a law degree—something one might consider a necessity for such a senior position—who was imported from Western Australia to fill this position. The potential to further disrupt the administration of refugee policy in Australia by a similar style of appointments to the Refugee Review Tribunal should be clear.

With administration like this, it is no surprise that we are here today. The government is failing to observe the every day proprieties of government and institutional relationships. It is prepared to treat the parliament and the public with contempt. In these circumstances, it is no wonder that we need to constantly correct its slapdash legislation.

         The constitutional validity of the damages cap provision has been called into question, as is well known, and in March 1994 the High Court delivered a judgment in which it decided that extinguishing a cause of action for damages against the Commonwealth in tort amounts to an acquisition for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. That empowers the Commonwealth to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth that have the effect of acquiring property from any state or person for any purpose in respect of which the Commonwealth parliament has the power to make laws, on condition that such acquisition is made on `just terms'.

          The main basis for the current constitutional challenge to the damages cap provision is that, as a reduction of the claim for damages, it is an acquisition of property without just terms and thus is contrary to section 51(xxxi).

         On the basis of the High Court decision in March last year, the Solicitor-General has given a written opinion that the High Court is likely to declare the damages cap provision invalid. He has also given advice that an amendment to the Migration Act that retrospectively made the unlawful detention lawful may be held by the High Court to be valid. That is what this bill seeks to do. I will comment on the Solicitor-General's advice.

         The object of the bill in giving authorities the power of detention in cases where the boat on which a person arrives has been destroyed or will not otherwise leave Australia must be called into question.

While Australia has done more than its fair share in the area of refugees, it is fairly clear, given the situation throughout the world, that we simply cannot take everyone.

We have been quite open in the preparation, drafting and intent of the legislation. What has been proposed at all times has been very open.

         Plainly, this is a most unusual provision and it is intended to meet a most unusual situation. But one has to call in question the genuine intention of the government with respect to that provision. What it is seeking to do is to amend the law retrospectively to cater for particular people and deprive them of particular rights. The remedy that the government proposes is set out in clause 9.

         The effect of the bill is to remedy a situation. It seeks to do that by, in effect, varying the approach, so that what is not done is the removal of rights but, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) put it in the second reading speech, an insertion of a curative clause. The curative clause was inserted on the advice of the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General's advice was based on a series of decisions in the High Court. Those decisions reflect a view, identified in American law, that, where the law has been understood to be, effectively, black, but is, in operation, white, it is merely curative to remedy the situation to what was previously understood.

         The authority that the High Court referred to, and the principal authority relied upon by the Solicitor-General in his advice, is a decision which prevented windfall benefits and windfall profits being acquired.

         —The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), is querying the case I am putting. The case I am putting is that the government in introducing the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is really anticipating that it will be held invalid in the High Court. If that is correct, one wonders what on earth the real reason is for introducing it. Since it was rejected by the Senate more than three months ago, has now been reintroduced and is likely to be passed after the three-month period specified in section 57, it raises the question of the real intentions of the government.

         This bill is very short, but there is also a most unusual provision for a short bill, a provision that raises directly the possibility that provisions of the bill are constitutionally invalid. It is not a common provision in a bill; it is more likely to be found in an acts interpretation bill or a bill dealing with legislation that is widely based. In this case, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) is contemplating that some provision of section 9 is going to be interpreted as having a valid operation and an invalid operation and is seeking to have the invalid operation inoperative and the valid operation as the one that takes effect. If that does not raise the issue of whether the legislation is constitutionally valid, I do not know what does.

         It raises a question which I seek to highlight of the intention of the government in introducing the legislation. The government is relying on two decisions of the High Court which really are quite distinguishable from the situation in contemplation here. If the best advice the government can get is the advice from the Solicitor-General relying on those two distinguishable cases, there is no case for the validity of the bill.

         That means that this bill, in the end, will do nothing to solve the problem faced by the government. In light of that, the position of the opposition in not opposing it is simply a position of saying, `There is nothing to be gained by opposing a bill that will be impotent and ineffective.' In saying that, I seek to highlight that the section 57 trigger is very much to the fore and it may take some time before the constitutional validity of the bill is determined if it follows the ordinary course.

         The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in his speech that the bill will provide the legislative authority to enforce and reflect in our law the terms of the agreement with the government of New Zealand. I might say that the New Zealand government is to be commended for pursuing this matter and reaching agreement, because this government not long ago reneged—ratted, in fact—on an agreement with the government of New Zealand in connection with the provision of domestic air services in Australia. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that agreement involved the access of Air New Zealand into the Australian domestic airline market. Hence the amendment which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition, which I am sure the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) will remember to second at the conclusion of my remarks.

         The finalisation of double tax agreements between Australia and our trading partners is a measure that Australian businesses with global plans urgently require. This double tax agreement is an especially important development in terms of closer economic relations—CER—between Australia and New Zealand. The CER process is vital to the economic development of both countries. The coalition makes no apology for its support of the CER process and its likely eventual outcome of delivering a single trans-Tasman market.

         The provisions of the agreement closely correspond with those in Australia's other modern double tax agreements. The particular agreement with New Zealand replaces the existing treaty concluded in 1992 and reflects major tax reforms in both countries since then.

         The bill amends the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953. Previous double tax agreements with New Zealand made in 1960 and in 1972 will continue to have the force of law for the years of income applicable at the relevant times under those agreements. In 1993 the Minister for Trade announced that the agreement would be renegotiated in February 1994. That announcement was preceded by statements in October 1991 by the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand that specific taxation arrangements which may have impeded bilateral trade and investment would be on the agenda for the 1992 review of closer economic relations. Both countries are attempting to pass the treaty legislation—for our part, that is this bill—by 1 April.

         The agreement deals with several tax issues such as income from real property, taxation of other income, entertainers and trans-Tasman rugby league players, business profits, withholding tax and capital gains tax. The agreement contains a new article to deal with income from real property. It will be taxed in the country of source; that is, in the country where the property is located. Income from real property extends to the direct use, leasing of any land or interest in land; and royalties and other payments for, or exploitation of, mines, quarries or other natural resources.

         Let us look at the facts. For 1994-95 Australia is facing a revised budget deficit of $12.3 billion, which is up from the initial forecast of $11.7 billion. New Zealand, on the other hand, with only 3 1/2 million people, will achieve a budget surplus this year of $NZ2.3 billion. New Zealand is also riding something approaching an economic boom, whilst Australia is perilously close to once again going down the economic slippery slope. New Zealand, through disciplined fiscal policy, is better able to meet the coming international economic challenges.

         In Australia, Labor cannot come to terms with the fiscal realities it has created for itself, and the immediate, and potentially long-term, prognosis is that Australia's economic interests will continue to be sacrificed. The government is currently examining other matters besides tax matters which will facilitate an increase in the level of trans-Tasman trade. Issues such as mutual recognition of product standards and occupational qualifications are being examined by both the Australian and New Zealand governments.

From the past performance of Labor, and considering the disastrous fiscal position we find ourselves in under Labor, it would be a wise man who predicted that the present government is going to tackle the harder CER issues.

         International money flows are in the news these days. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is to be commended for having the foresight to recognise there is a serious problem with money laundering around the world these days. This is particularly the case as international money markets continue to open up because of legislation such as that now before the House and due to other developments. In some European countries, laws exist by which accountants must report suspicious money flows which may be part of a money laundering operation. We do not have such laws in Australia, and we should not need them so long as accountants recognise they have an obligation to report to the proper authorities any suspected money laundering activities.

         —I trust that my enthusiasm can match that of the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1995 enshrines in law the new double taxation agreement between Australia and New Zealand which was signed by the parties in January of this year, effectively updating the 1972 agreement on the same matters.

         The bill seeks to place into law a number of matters flowing from that agreement, effectively updating and reforming the substance of the agreement, particularly relating to taxation of income from property; taxation of fringe benefits; the reduction of the withholding tax on royalties from 15 per cent to 10 per cent; change with respect to the taxation of business profits of branches of an Australian company operating in New Zealand, now being taxed separately; and various other matters of detail.

         In effect, as I indicated, this is an update of a longstanding agreement to take into account various changes in the taxation arrangements that evolve from time to time in both countries. It removes a number of uncertainties and anomalies which have impeded Australian companies doing business in New Zealand. As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has indicated, the close connection with the closer economic relations agreement—the CER agreement—is acknowledged by the government. Clearly, that is a matter of major substance in this debate.

         This legislation generally ensures that income earned in each country is taxed only once. It helps to assist in a number of matters that are under active consideration. One example that was cited by the honourable member for Curtin was the development of the new trans-Tasman rugby league competition, which will have the Auckland Warriors playing in Australia. As a result of this legislation, the players will be taxed only once on their winnings, on the basis of their country of residence. That is one fairly straightforward illustration. Sadly, we cannot have an AFL equivalent because the people of New Zealand have not really taken to that code, but we can live in hope for the future.

         The legislation is also clearly part of the gradual process of the Australian and New Zealand economies, if not integrating, at least getting more closely linked. It contains a number of detailed provisions to ensure that the mechanisms for allocating tax liability within the economic activity that occurs across the Tasman are as fair and open as possible. For example, there is a provision for a `tie breaker rule' which is a mechanism to determine whether a person is actually resident in Australia or New Zealand legally and, therefore, which particular tax regime that person will be subject to. There are a variety of provisions in the legislation with respect to detailed circumstances—for example, the circumstance of entertainers' incomes, directors' fees, old age pensions, maintenance flowing from family law settlements or judgments and various other matters—but I will not go into those in detail.

Those points also fail to take into account some perfectly legitimate reasons why the things that he and some people in the business community seek have not come about on this occasion.

         His complaint was the failure of the agreement to provide a zero rate for dividend withholding tax. The basic reason for this is that the New Zealand tax system is still substantially different from that of Australia. I note that the honourable member for Curtin referred to an agreement between Ireland and Finland with respect to the mutual recognition of taxation and economic activity between those two countries. I am not aware of the precise detail of the agreement and express some surprise that they could manage to come to such an agreement, given that they are quite different countries with different cultures and languages, although perhaps not quite as different as he might think. In terms of culture, origin and geography, Australia and New Zealand are probably about as close as any two countries in the world and as yet are unable to come to such an agreement.

         The honourable member for Curtin, in his exposition, missed one point: the question of taxation systems. It is fairly safe to assume that one of the reasons such an agreement was able to be reached between Ireland and Finland was that they had compatible taxation arrangements which meant that the two could sit together without the risk of avoidance mechanisms emerging as a result of the agreement. That, indeed, is the primary reason we have not been able to enter into the arrangements sought by the honourable member for Curtin at this stage.

         The Australian taxation system is substantially different from the New Zealand taxation system in a number of pertinent respects, the critical difference being that New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax. There are a number of other areas, such as a much greater reliance on indirect taxation in New Zealand. New Zealand also imposes withholding tax even though company profits have been fully taxed.

         With respect to the request from the New Zealand government that dividend imputation credits be fully recognised, thereby effectively leading to a zero rating: the Australian government's concern, which led it to decline that request, is the risk of two consequences flowing from it. One is the development of a trans-Tasman avoidance industry based on the perceived need of Australian companies to avoid capital gains tax. That would run the risk of our heading back into the sort of situation we had in the 1970s and early 1980s with income being effectively changed artificially into capital gains and ultimately, in this case, being channelled in some form or other through a New Zealand corporate arrangement in order to avoid tax. That is obviously a legitimate concern on the part of the government.

         The second concern was the risk that, as a result or related to it, we would see a net shift in investment away from Australia into New Zealand, which is obviously something that none of us would desire, certainly on the basis of taxation arrangements. Partly as a result of that—it is probably arguable as to what extent that concern was involved—the New Zealand government declined to agree to change its dividend withholding tax arrangements. For the information of the honourable member for Curtin, Australia pressed for a zero rate for dividend withholding tax, and the New Zealand government declined.

         New Zealand was not prepared to consider lowering its dividend withholding tax without mutual recognition of dividend imputation credits. This is ironic when you consider the comments made by the honourable member for Curtin that, according to New Zealand, the primary reason was that dividend withholding tax is a significant revenue base for the government and also part of its international anti-tax avoidance regime. The key thing that he is accusing the government of doing in this case is in fact the primary reason why the New Zealand government adopted the position that he does not like. Its reason for taking its position on one half of this issue—namely, concern about international tax avoidance—is the same as the Australian government's reason for taking its position with respect to the recognition of imputation credits.

         Ultimately, I do not think we have any villain in this issue. We have a simple situation where the two tax regimes in the two countries are not sufficiently compatible at this stage to allow the agreement to go as far as the honourable member for Curtin has sought without actually creating significant problems, such as greater tax avoidance. That does not mean that these things cannot occur in the future.

         It is also worth while to point out to the opposition that the government, in a sense, faced a choice here. It could have chosen to put the other issues that are in this legislation on the backburner and said, `We'll keep negotiating with the New Zealand government,' but it has decided to say, `We will make the gains, the update and the improvement that go with respect to the various matters relating to property income, FBT and the like in this legislation, accepting that we are unable to reach agreement on the issues that the honourable member for Curtin has raised.' That does not mean that those issues are going to go off into the never-never and never be addressed again. Clearly, they will remain the subject of potential discussion between Australia and New Zealand in the future. Obviously, future changes in the taxation regimes of either country could well lead to a different situation.

         It is probably also worth referring to the supplementary comments made by the honourable member for Curtin because they were yet another amusing example of the hypocritical approach the opposition has to fiscal matters. Yet again we have the opposition, albeit in a fairly minor guise in this case, indicating that it supports forgoing revenue. Another example is when the opposition says the Commonwealth in effect should spend taxpayers' money or forgo tax revenue in a particular area. I suppose it is equivalent in a much lesser way to some of the promises that the honourable member for Berowra, who is sitting on the opposition front bench, has hinted at in press releases recently, which the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has given a thorough examination of in question time in recent months in this place.

The honourable member for Curtin, in a few fairly typical comments, mentioned how terrible the deficit was.

They did that very well in 1993. They frightened people so well with their policy that they lost an election as a result. Fortunately for the people of Australia, for a change they were honest about their policies. Now they are slipping back into the old Andrew Peacock populist model: `Let's not tell them anything.

         So yet again in this debate the opposition has said something that is inherently contradictory to its basic broad position in the public arena: `Let's have more dollars floating out of the Commonwealth exchequer. Let's say, "No problems. Here is some more corporate welfare—a small but nonetheless significant amount"'. Again, a little illustration of the hypocrisy of the opposition on fiscal matters. I will conclude by returning to the essence of the legislation.

         —My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker. Perhaps the honourable member for Berowra might chat with his colleague in the future and suggest that he not do so. The legislation, whatever the criticisms of the opposition, is nonetheless a significant step forward for the process of greater economic integration between Australia and New Zealand—something that is both inevitable and worth while. There is common agreement on both sides of the House on that process.

         It does not reach a level of complete integration, the reason being that both countries still retain control over their respective taxation systems. For a whole variety of reasons, which I think we are entitled to assume are legitimate, there are differences between the taxation systems of the two countries. There are different economic and political imperatives. Therefore, the objectives sought by certain elements in the business community and by the honourable member for Curtin have not been achievable in this context. As I said earlier, I do not believe there are any villains in that regard. It is simply a reflection of the different economic and political imperatives that are driving both the interests of Australia, with its taxation system as it currently operates, and the interests of New Zealand. With respect to the recognition of dividends and the related question of withholding tax on dividends, at this point they have proved to be hurdles which we are unable to overcome.

We need to acknowledge that this is a significant step forward. It has been 23 years since the previous agreement was put in place. An awful lot has happened in the taxation structure of both countries since then. This bill updates the arrangements applying to taxation across the countries. The degree of trans-Tasman economic activity has increased substantially in that time and will undoubtedly increase substantially in the future as the two economies—and indeed those two economies as part of the broader region—internationalise more rapidly.

I commend the bill to the House.

What will it do? Will it increase income tax and make cuts? That is probably what it will do.

The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill gives the force of law in Australia to a new double tax agreement signed with New Zealand on 27 January 1995. The new agreement replaces an existing treaty concluded in 1972, which itself followed an agreement in 1960. This bill has become necessary because of the major tax changes in both countries since that time.

         Double tax agreements are designed to ensure that income flowing between one country and another is taxed only once. Agreements also provide for cooperation between tax authorities to prevent tax evasion. Australia has double tax agreements with 35 countries in Asia, Europe, Scandinavia and America. As New Zealand is our closest neighbour and the country with which we have the closest trading, investment and social links, it is essential that our countries have an effective modern double tax agreement. It is clearly a vital element of closer economic relations that our tax systems be harmonised also as strongly as possible.

         All double tax agreements are complex and generally only go part of the way towards meeting their objective of ensuring that income is taxed only once. Despite our closeness with New Zealand, there are some particular difficulties in negotiating a double tax agreement with that country. The agreement covers only federal taxes. In New Zealand the federal government is the major taxing authority. In Australia, however, our state governments impose significant taxes, including many which apply also to New Zealand citizens doing business in this country. New Zealand has no capital gains tax, but Australia has the harshest capital gains tax in the world. New Zealand relies more heavily on indirect taxes, including a goods and services tax, but it has a government which is more committed to expenditure restraint than the mad taxing, wild spending spree regime that Australian taxpayers must endure from their Labor government.

         A proportion of property and property trust income in Australia is tax free through such measures as depreciation allowance and some is deferred until the time of the sale of the property or units. These provisions are not, however, recognised in the US and an Australian must pay full US tax without credit on his income. In cases where the assets of property trusts are frozen by statute, an Australian is locked into a double tax situation.

         My constituent advises me that US capital gains tax is set at a flat rate of 28 per cent and is payable on the total difference between the purchase and sale prices without any allowance for inflation. When an Australian becomes a non-resident for income tax purposes he must pay Australian capital gains tax on the deemed market value after CPI indexation on the day of departing Australia. That Australian, when deemed to be a US resident must, on the sale of the Australian assets still in Australia, pay full US capital gains tax on the non-indexed difference between the purchase price and the sale price, not simply on the difference between the sale price and the market value on the date of entering the USA.

        The Treasurer's reply included the clear implication that the government was about to commence negotiations with the United States on a new double tax agreement. However, when I had heard nothing further about the progress of these negotiations 18 months later, I put questions on notice to the Treasurer to ascertain what progress had been made. On 15 December 1993, the Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear)—whom I notice has re-entered the chamber to make sure that any amendments he might be proposing are not forgotten on this particular piece of legislation—replied.

         The Assistant Treasurer's reply represented a complete turnaround, it seemed, in the government's attitude. No, there were no problems with the existing Australia-USA double tax agreement. Changes to the income tax laws of either country had not given rise to double taxation. There was no double taxation on capital gains. Double taxation should not occur in regard to bonus issues of shares or on the income of business trusts and property. Then, in a further insult to our intelligence, the Assistant Treasurer claimed:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . double taxation should not occur as a result of the dividend imputation system because franked dividends paid by Australian companies to overseas shareholders are exempt under Australian tax laws and dividend withholding tax to the extent that they are franked.

       <para>
        Not much of what the Assistant Treasurer said in his response to my question was completely accurate. It was a direct contradiction of the comments of the former Treasurer almost two years earlier. As has been demonstrated by previous speakers in this debate, there are difficulties with this question of franked dividends and the issue of double taxation arises.

         Many overseas governments do not recognise the fact that tax has been paid on franked dividends in the country of operation and thus should not be subject to further tax in the home country of offshore shareholders. I recognise that this issue is not easy and that, in negotiating a double tax agreement, parties seek to maintain for their own country whatever competitive advantage they might be able to obtain. In spite of all the rhetoric about taxation fairness that usually surrounds a double tax agreement, self-interest is only vaguely disguised.

         I suppose the only way that international tax fairness could occur would be to have a uniform system of taxation around the world. I doubt that that will ever occur; nor is it necessarily desirable. Many countries use a favourable taxation regime to encourage investment and they are certainly not going to trade off that advantage easily. Indeed, Australia with its harsh system of business taxation, mountainous bureaucracy and endless paper work has often been the loser. Many Australian companies have chosen to relocate overseas to escape our punitive taxation regime. On the other hand, most of the burgeoning economic tigers of Asia and the Americas have attracted investment on the basis of favourable tax treatment.

         My constituent has suggested that Australia could address the issue of double taxation of franked dividends independent of double tax agreements by amending Australian legislation so that an Australian company paying franked dividends would not pay Australian company tax on the dividends which are paid to non-resident shareholders, but instead pay the full amount—that is, the equivalent of the franked dividend plus the imputed credit or company tax—as an unfranked dividend but with a larger withholding tax deducted equivalent to the amount which would have been paid as company tax. Non-resident shareholders who are residents of the United States, for instance, for income tax purposes would then be taxed on the full cashed amount but would receive a US tax credit for that withholding tax up to the amount of the US tax which they would have been liable to pay on that dividend, and therefore the double taxation would be avoided. While my constituent's suggestion would have added some complexity, it would be fairer to shareholders of Australian companies and would also provide encouragement for investment in Australia by overseas shareholders.

         The Australia-New Zealand double tax agreement is certainly an improvement on the existing arrangements and in that regard it is welcomed. It could lead to more Australian investment in New Zealand as it clarifies some of the anomalies which have arisen since the last treaty. I suspect that there will be less reciprocal advantage. The agreement, however, has not resolved the problem of mutual recognition of dividend imputation rebates and it has not addressed the inequity in the imposition by New Zealand of this withholding tax of 15 per cent. New Zealand has protected its revenue, but Australian citizens who are shareholders in companies operating in New Zealand are the losers.

         —in reply—I would like to thank all those who took part in the debate on the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1995 today and maybe make just a few points in closing the debate. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), talked about tax treatment in Asia and the way in which countries in Asia might attract foreign investment. I point out to him that the social security net we have is not a feature of those economies. If he wants to compare tax treatment as a single issue, that is fine, but there is more to attracting companies to a particular country than tax treatment.

         I think the previous speaker also said that the capital gains tax in Australia was the most onerous in the world. He knows that is not true. The simple fact is that ours is fully indexed for inflation. There are not too many countries around the world where the real rate is applied to the capital gains tax. So once again he is wrong in making that assertion.

I do not want to add any more words to what my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) said in explaining why agreement could not be reached on the mutual recognition of imputation credits. He also explained that while Australia pressed for a zero rate of withholding tax on New Zealand dividends, New Zealand would not agree to it.

         Although that issue has not been resolved, the new agreement makes a number of major improvements in a range of areas. I read those out in my second reading speech. Given the fact that we could not reach agreement on all of those things, I think members would agree that it is not worth holding up this agreement, and all the benefits that will flow from it, because we could not get agreement on every issue. That is why the bill is in here now.

         Australia has been a party to the parent treaty, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 (Civil Liability Convention), since 1984. The primary objective of the Civil Liability Convention is to create a system of compulsory oil pollution liability insurance for the owners of oil tankers.

         The 1992 protocol was developed to overcome the effects of inflation on the real values of the limits of liability. For vessels of less than 5,000 gross tons the protocol envisages liability of three million special drawing rights, as defined by the International Monetary Fund. This is equivalent to approximately $A5.8 million.

         For larger vessels, liability is calculated on the basis of the vessels tonnage, with an overall maximum for the ship's liability of 59.7 million special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund, or $A114.5 million. These levels ensure that the damage that such a ship can cause will be more effectively compensated.

         Compensation available under Civil Liability Convention is supplemented by a separate convention, known as the fund convention, which will shortly enter into force for Australia. Other amendments effected by the 1992 Civil Liability Convention Protocol include extension of the geographic scope of the convention to cover incidents occurring in the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. This will afford additional protection to sensitive areas such as the Great Barrier Reef and safeguard existing and potential fisheries in the Australian fishing zone.

         The 1992 protocol replaces an earlier 1984 protocol, which Australia acceded to in June 1988. The 1984 protocol was expressed to enter into force when ratified by 10 countries, including six which have at least one million gross tons of tanker tonnage. While 13 countries, including Australia, have ratified the protocol to date, only two have the required minimum tanker tonnage.

         In recent years the International Maritime Organisation, which administers the convention, has recognised that the 1984 protocol is unlikely to gain the required ratification by countries with the minimum tonnage unless it is ratified by the United States, the world's leading oil importer. This is now unlikely to occur, as the liability provisions of the United States' Oil Pollution Act 1990 are inconsistent with those of the CLC Protocol and therefore preclude US ratification. As a result, the 1992 protocol was adopted as a replacement protocol, with the only substantive alteration to the earlier protocol being a less restrictive entry into force provision.

         The amendments to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 will reduce the maximum crew level for eligibility for a grant from 23 to 18. This accords with the existing crewing practices in the Australian Trading Fleet. I might add that earlier today a number of amendments which the government proposes to move when the House considers the bill in the consideration in detail stage were circulated to members in the House. I now present a supplementary explanatory memorandum in connection with those amendments. I commend the bill to the House.

         —Last weekend in my electorate there was a fairly devastating fire which I am sure all honourable members are aware of. I will let the House know the extent of that damage. Fortunately, there were only three minor injuries; five dwellings were destroyed—two were confirmed principal residences and the others are still being assessed; and seven vehicles were destroyed. Some 11,000 hectares were burnt, which is a considerable amount of land, about 2,000 hectares of which was privately owned.

         I am sure honourable the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), representing rural and regional electorates, know of the utter devastation of fire. I have fought fires—I have come within a whisker of being one of those unfortunate statistics, along with others on several fire trucks—and it is frightening. This was a fire that regrettably, as has happened so often now over so many years, was the result of the negligence of some members of the community. This fire started from an illegal camp fire on a day when there was a total fire ban.

         There is nothing more devastating for a rural community than for a fire to start but, when that fire is started by illegal activities, it is even more devastating. I know there are others who want to speak on the adjournment. I pay tribute to the 650-odd firefighters who fought this fire; the three arms of the emergency services—the DCNR firefighters, St John's Ambulance and the SES; the Red Cross; and the many hundreds of people who manned fire stations, public halls and other community centres providing support for the band of firefighters, the great bulk of whom were volunteers. People were moved out of their homes on the Saturday night when it looked like the fire may well have reached devastating proportions—in loss of life and in property.

There is a very small group—fortunately it is only a small group—in this country that has absolutely no respect for property or life.

        While representing a primitive and popular style of politics not uncommon during the early decades of this century, Anstey went further, adding a strongly racial component to his economic nationalism.

         In his crazed rush to criticise the ALP, the member for Wills has overlooked the core reason why modern Labor has had cause to condemn the money power thesis. It is based on intolerance. It is based on racism and anti-Semitism of the worst kind. In his 1984 publication,

        This anti-Semitism in the Kingdom of Shylock was no aberration. It arose from the logic of (Anstey's) analysis combined with the cultural tradition of which he was a part. Christian mythology had built up an accretion of hatred and suspicion towards Jews over many centuries. The resulting stereotype of the greedy and cunning Jewish financier was a commonplace convention in the writings of British radicals and American populists . . . It was hardly surprising that a man of Anstey's background should have chosen to invoke such a stereotype . . . the ultimate force of this argument depended on the willingness of his audience to accept the racist assumptions on which the stereotype was based.

He is on the record as a strong anti-Semitic public figure. Moreover, I urge the member for Wills to update and broaden his approach to politics. In truth, his type of economic nationalism has always relied on an exceedingly narrow, unenlightened and xenophobic view of Australia's future. The member for Wills has pinned his ideology to the post-federation Australian settlement; that is, tariff protection all round, centralised industrial relations and economic nationalism.

         No-one in this House should be misled by the motives underpinning this approach. These were social values based on a belief in the supremacy of a white, Anglo-Saxon, male dominated culture in Australia. Egalitarianism was expressed only in the context of this narrow social framework. While Australian men treated their mates as equals and while good blokes always received a fair go, Asian trade was locked out by tariff walls, and non-Anglo-Saxon migrants were excluded by the white Australia policy. Domestically, women were denied social opportunities, and Aborigines were comprehensively repressed.

         It should be remembered, for instance, that when Frank Anstey campaigned against conscription during World War I he did so fearful that conscripts sent to Europe would be replaced in the Australian labour market by Asians. This is the same Anstey held out by the member for Wills as a bloke with a bit of spirit and moral courage. It does not take courage to discriminate. The member for Wills should not endorse those views.

         I think the opposition has a bit of gall coming in here and lecturing us about Aboriginal health, or any other area of social policy. As far as Aboriginal health or Aboriginal issues are concerned, the problems of Aboriginal people in Australia started not in 1983, as the opposition would have us believe, but in 1788, about 195 years earlier. That was the year when we had British settlement or, as some people would say, a British invasion of this country.

         Since 1788, as we all know, there has been a sorry tale of discrimination, dispossession and general disadvantage suffered by the indigenous people of this country. It has continued from 1788 through to the present day. Until 1901 we did not have a national government; we had six state governments. In 1901 with federation we adopted the constitution that we hear lots of talk about from the opposition; how we have a constitution that we must uphold and which must never change. That constitution, apart from not even recognising Aboriginal people, entrenched significant power in state governments, power which remains today.

         In 1901 we had the constitution. State governments—then and now—have primary responsibility for the delivery of health services, amongst many other things. So to come in here and blame the federal government that has been in for 12 years for the problems of Aboriginal health, is the height of hypocrisy. In 1967 we had a referendum. It was one of the few useful things I can remember a coalition government doing—even if it took it 18 years to make it happen. Nevertheless, we did have a referendum which now enables Commonwealth governments to pass legislation to implement policy in relation to indigenous people. That is what we have tried to do with ATSIC and with the Native Title Act, which was vigorously opposed by the opposition.

         Mr Speaker, do you remember the main obstacle in passing the Native Title Act? It was not the mining companies, Aboriginal people, pastoralists or even the Senate; it was state governments.

         Let me remind the House that state governments also have primary responsibility for health, just as they have for housing and some other areas such as education; areas in which Aboriginal people continue to suffer major disadvantage and discrimination in comparison with the rest of the Australian community. It is not only Aboriginal health which is a problem, there is a problem with mental health. A couple of years ago there was a report called the Burdekin report. Brian Burdekin was very critical of mental health services and the lack of them. He was very critical of state governments which had almost an exclusive role in that area until the last couple of years.

         Burdekin was also critical of the Commonwealth government. He is critical of it because he says that it is up to us as a Commonwealth government to make the states perform and deliver and not to use the excuse that it is a state responsibility. I happen to agree with that but it is very difficult, whether we are talking about Aboriginal health, mental health, housing or any other area of government responsibility, to try to get some sense into the structure of government and Commonwealth-state responsibilities when one side of politics in Australia, the opposition, has no policies, no commitment to social justice and only seems to stand for the Queen, the constitution and states' rights. That is all we ever hear from them, in one form or another.

         —While so many Australians are unemployed because of the inept economic policies of the last decade, the federal government has been forced to divide unemployed people into categories and direct most of its funding towards those people who have been unemployed for the longest time. The long-term unemployed have become the clear focus of the government's job strategy. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) professes to have a particular concern for the long-term unemployed. He has told us that he does not want to leave them behind. But one odd statement he made at the Press Club last year makes it seems as though the Prime Minister is slightly nervous about the long-term unemployed and is waiting for them to riot. He said:

        We have close to half a million long-term unemployed. He makes them sound like a restless vigilante group or a clan from another country. It is no wonder he is nervous about the long-term unemployed. Australians who have been out of work for years are becoming much more frustrated and have little faith in this government which has had over a decade to deal with unemployment.

         However, tonight I would like to touch on those people who are not yet long-term unemployed. They are the short-term unemployed, if you like. These are people who have recently joined the unemployment queues and are desperate to get back into the work force before they become another long-term unemployment statistic. Several constituents have contacted me because they are frustrated with the lack of help available from government programs, unless they have been classified as the long-term unemployed. It is a vicious circle.

         These people must virtually wait for themselves to become long-term unemployed before the government will help them. Take, for example, a young man from Lock, a small town in my electorate of Grey: he was unemployed for some months and then enrolled in a TAFE course. Following that course he was registered as unemployed again, and continued to be so for the following eight months.

         He then learned of a job vacancy in the town—a rare event in small communities in regional Australia. He applied for the job. However, he was not eligible for the Labor government's jobstart program because he had not been unemployed for 12 consecutive months—the emphasis being on the word `consecutive'. If he had not undertaken the TAFE course and had remained on unemployment benefits, he could have had a shot at the job. As it was, he was penalised for extending his education and straying from the dole queue.

         This adherence to an unbroken 12 months of unemployment and unwavering focus on the long-term unemployed is unfair and unreasonable. While I understand that we focus on those people who have been out of work for the longest, it is callous and wrong to deny any unemployed person in a situation such as I have just described. We are neglecting those people who have been out of work for less than 12 months.

         They are the forgotten unemployed, with unequal access to the government's programs. They have to earn their colours first. They have to be unemployed an entire year before they can get a look-in—and all because this government has created so much unemployment that it only has the resources to direct assistance to a few. With latest indications that Working Nation programs are falling behind targets, one does not hold out much hope for any unemployed people under the Keating government. The short-term unemployed, in particular, have a long wait ahead of them.

         During the period 1982 to 1985 I had very close contact with these organisations when I was shadow minister for police and emergency services in the Victorian state parliament. Mr Speaker, you will recall that was the period of the disastrous Ash Wednesday fires. I say to you and the members of this House that the efforts of the Country Fire Authority and all of the emergencies services during that period were outstanding. I know that approximately 650 volunteers were ready and willing to participate and help in fighting the fires in Ballarat. They did a magnificent job. I concur with the views that have been put forward by my colleague the member for Ballarat.

         My reason for raising this matter is that central Victoria is still in the grip of drought. Conditions are still extremely dry. There has been virtually no rain since June. The emergency services are on stand-by. They have already issued warnings to people to ensure that their properties are clear of all debris and that they have taken adequate fire procedures so that risk is minimised during that period.

         The Country Fire Authority has over 100,000 volunteers. When the fires broke out in New South Wales many members of the Country Fire Authority in Victoria who were on stand-by went to the fires in New South Wales. I recently visited the Newstead fire brigade who were called on. They did not have one moment of hesitation, they volunteered to go, they were asked to go; and they did a magnificent job, as did all of the other Victorian brigades that went to assist the New South Wales rural fire brigades. It was a traumatic time for New South Wales. I know that the help given by the fire services in Victoria played a major part in assisting New South Wales to overcome some of the difficulties that they were in.

         I say to everyone who was involved in the emergency services in Ballarat: congratulations on an outstanding effort. It could have been much worse: there was a very bad wind blowing and I know that they were fighting the fire under great difficulties. It is a tribute to the emergency services in Victoria for the fine way in which they responded directly to a call for help. They put in a magnificent performance. The services are well disciplined and well trained. I am sure that training stood them in very good stead in Ballarat; otherwise it could have been much worse.

        Since the advent of competition, prices have been reduced through both reductions in standard charges as well as an increasing number of pricing options which customers can select to suit their calling profile. The price reductions over both 1992/93 and 1993/94 have been significant and are attributable to both the effect of the price capping arrangements applying to Telecom and the impact of the competition in the market by the entrance of Optus and Vodafone.

        Compared with the prices available for domestic and international long distance calls and mobile services at the start of 1992/93, Optus' entry into the market has made even larger price reductions available to consumers than those implemented by Telecom to meet the price cap arrangements.

        During 1992/93 there was a 3.6 per cent reduction in Telecom's average revenue-weighted prices.

In particular, the price reductions calculated for price cap purposes show that international prices fell by 11.6 per cent, STD prices fell by 4 per cent and mobile prices, on average, fell by 8.7 per cent.

This is based on an analysis of how much consumers would have had to pay to use the same quantity of services (in total) priced at start of year prices compared with the prices applicable at the end of the period.

        Optus' entry into the market and the changes implemented by Telecom has seen a rapid growth on the range of choice of service and pricing options available to consumers. In particular, the increased use of Flexi-Plans by Telecom, de-averaged trunk prices, the introduction of per-second charging for long-distance calls, and the significant use of short-term introductory and promotional discounts by both carriers has dramatically increased information and choice to consumers.

        However, it can be said that the introduction of network-based competition provides Telecom with an incentive to improve its rates of productivity and minimise underlying costs. Telecom have advised that it has engaged in a cost rationalisation process in order to increase its level of efficiency. In addition, I understand that Telecom has been able to reduce its costs through increased utilisation of the latest generation of telecommunications infrastructure.

        The nature of this question is quite broad. The response aims to include expenditure on IT hardware, software, services (including bureau agreements), consultancies, maintenance and, where possible, training. Expenditure records cannot always be disaggregated in this form by all the different portfolio agencies. Hence the response from each organisation may vary depending on their financial system.

        Yes. The airport is being operated in accordance with the procedures described in the Draft EIS in relation to the impact on Kurnell. Mode 1, that is operation to the south, is the preferred mode of runway utilisation and, since the parallel runway has been operational, this mode has been used wherever possible subject to the operational requirements for runway selection.
