              <span class="HPS-Small">Jetstar has cancelled Bookings, and issued unauthorized vouchers, which are then invalidated by actions which suggest it is carried out by Jetstar itself. There is considerable evidence pointing to Jetstar acting illegally, and maliciously to void vouchers. It uses personal data of customers to book an alternative flight, which becomes a no-show. This is done without the authority of the person making the original booking. Incorrect or inaccurate information was used. Jetstar had the details to carry out the fraud itself. Jetstar monitors social media and collects data, enabling it to act illegally. It failed intentionally its duty of care to a customer.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to set up a Parliamentary Inquiry, into Corporate Jetstar Fraud looking specifically at Bookings, and inviting responses from affected Australians. The Terms of Reference should include a complete and thorough review of all steps within the process from when an original booking is made. The Inquiry should also recommend appropriate steps to be taken to avoid this occurring again in the future, and recommend appropriate penalties and compensation for affected Australians.</span>

It is a vaccine that is based on older technology that has been around for decades and is a protein-based vaccine not MRNA nor a viral vector vaccine. Covax-19 has shown exceptional results in phase 3 clinical trials and phase 1 and 2 prior to this, unlike the current options of Pfizer and AZ vaccines which have not completed Phase 3 clinical trials and has been approved for use in Iran.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision in November 2020 to extinguish 2SQN from the Army's Order of Battle (ORBAT) in an early response to the Brereton Report inflicted group punishment on all past and present members of that proud unit for alleged crimes that are yet to be tested in a court of law. Group punishment is invariably an abhorrent and arbitrary measure, tainting the entirety for the alleged crimes of the few. The repugnant nature of group punishment is compounded in this case by being applied prematurely and selectively against the rank and file while failing to censure the senior commanders who had a personal responsibility for oversight when alleged crimes were committed. Worse still, the punishment has been applied retrospectively. 2SQN's removal from the ORBAT casts doubt on the honour, sacrifice and reputation of 2SQN veterans dating back to the unit's establishment in 1964. Hundreds of former members who have served in the squadron since that time are now forever shamed and linked to untested crimes allegedly committed by the few in the past decade. We are firmly in favour of punishment where wrongdoing is proven, but the disproportionate sweep of this group punishment is an overreach. The shaming of innocents through the generations is no way to address the matters raised in the Brereton Report. 2SQN SASR must be restored to the ORBAT as a matter of natural justice for all.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Covax-19 is a protein based vaccine developed by an Australian company, Vaxine, here in Australia. This company has received no funding support from the Australian Government (other than a small token grant) despite petitioning for funding.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">They are the first vaccine for Covid-19 developed in the Southern Hemisphere and the first protein based vaccine to receive Emergency Use Authorisation, and yet Australia has provided no support, no funding, and no opportunity for manufacturing in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For many people, taking an essentially untested mRNA vaccine is too risky, but they will happily take a traditional protein based vaccine. This is a perfect opportunity to further boost vaccine rates in Australia by providing an alternative, well known and trusted type of vaccine.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to : in general, support Australian vaccine companies such as Vaxine; to provide funding to Australian vaccine companies (like they do for CSL); and also provide opportunities for Aussie vaccine companies to manufacture vaccines within Australia (like CSL are manufacturing the UK AstraZeneca but won't agree to manufacture Covax-19). We also ask the House specifically to review the product created by Vaxine—Covax-19—with the aim of approving it for use in Australia as an alternative to the mRNA vaccines. This will provide more choice to Australians and likely boost vaccine-take up.</span>

From nurses and accountants, to hospitality staff and construction workers, Australian economy lacks the cogs for the economy to get moving. Inside the country are located thousands of skilled workers, who stayed in Australia during these extraordinary times, working hard with their fellow Australian colleagues to help built a strong line of defense against the heavy economic impact of Covid19. Some of these workers have their visas nearly expiring, others cannot renew them, and others need to apply for new visas with less working rights. These people are the ones that have proven during the hardest of times, that they have the necessary skills that Australia needs to help restart the economy and overcome the difficulties of the past 2 years. New Zealand, acknowledging the contribution of her own temporary workers, has offered an one-off permanent resident visa to all these people that helped her during the pandemic. Australia's Trans-Tasman ally has set the example, has organized the structure and the methods of implementations for this to happen.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to provide an one off permanent residence visa option to all temporary workers that are eligible under the Commonwealth requirements. It is critical this permanent visa to be available for everybody eligible as soon as possible, in order to take away the stress of these people and reward them for their loyalty towards Australia. </span>

Currently, there is a mid 3000 cap placed on this visa, however, as of 10/2021, there are 60000+ visa applications on the queue. This 3000 cap also includes those 103 visa application which was changed to 143 visa later on. In immigration website, it it mentioned that it takes at least 64months to process 143visa, but in reality, based on statistics available, it takes at least 20years to process.

We draw your attention to the reasons why the Australian Government should support COVAX-19 vaccine: * COVAX-19 is the first recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine to be authorised anywhere in the world, beating Novavax to this key milestone. * COVAX-19 has been developed on a more familiar, well-characterised platform—this addresses community apprehension regarding the unknown long-term safety of the mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines. * COVAX-19 vaccine was developed by Australians, for the benefit of Australians—Australians should be entitled to now have access to it. * COVAX-19 has the potential to draw international attention to the capabilities of Australian science and to generate significant export revenues, provided Vaxine Pty Ltd is not forced by the Government's actions to move overseas. * COVAX-19 is the only completely new vaccine successfully developed in Australia in the last 40 years—a landmark achievement that the government needs to applaud rather than ignore. * COVAX-19 is the first COVID-19 vaccine developed in the Southern hemisphere to achieve market authorisation.</span>

We also note that the PM gave Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) an undertaking last year to provide Australians with a vaccine option that is untainted in form, fit and function all through its development and deployment life cycle. The EngeneIC vaccine would appear to be an opportunity to make good the PM's undertaking, noting few SARS-CoV-2 vaccines satisfy the ethical condition.</span>

This is unfair and unreasonable—and increasingly untenable—as states around the country are passing legislation in this area. Territory citizens are being denied their democratic rights and are disadvantaged on the basis of where they live. This situation should not be allowed to persist.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's borders are opening up to Europe, as they experience a deadly fourth wave of coronavirus, much worse than previously. Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Poland, Czechia and Slovakia are exploding in uncontained coronavirus outbreaks. Australia does not have a triage mechanism in place to slow down arrivals from hotspots, such as medihotel quarantine for some, and home quarantine for others. Australia does not have a triage mechanism to increase the threshold of pre-arrival requirements, such as three vaccine doses for some and two vaccine doses for others, based on perceived risks to Australia. The vaccination of children in Europe remains unclear. The other side of this equation is the varying levels of double vaccinations across Australia. By Christmas 2021, NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT will be around 94% double vaccinated. The other jurisdictions may be 84% double vaccinated, but 78% is more likely. Herein lies the demographic problems, as 55% of Indigenous Australians live in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. They live in much less vaccinated jurisdictions. The second concern is Indigenous Australians are much younger, with a median age of 23 years. We know younger people and children are much less vaccinated, and we know Indigenous Australians are much less vaccinated. These biostatistics point to a health emergency developing in younger Indigenous communities, especially in those lower vaccinated jurisdictions, as international travel reignites.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Climate change is the most important challenge humanity faces today. Manufacturers of vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) know exactly what damage their products cause to our climate, and to people's health. Nevertheless, many of them choose to delay the transition to clean solutions, for example electric vehicles (EVs). They attempt to maximise their profits now, at the expense of society later. </span>

That's how they trick consumers into buying vehicles that will poison the air for decades to come. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. Millions of Falun Gong practitioners in China have been fired, jailed, tortured or killed by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999. There have been persistent reports of systematic, statesanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in China, primarily practitioners of Falun Gong. The Independent China Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, concluded in its Final Judgement in 2019: "Forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale and that Falun Gong practitioners have been one—and probably the main—source of organ supply" and that crimes against humanity against Falun Gong have been proved "beyond reasonable doubt". </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Australian government to: 1. Pass a motion or make a statement to openly request an immediate end to the 20-year persecution ofFalun Gong in China and the immediate release of all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience; 2. Urge China to immediately end the practice of organ harvesting from all prisoners of conscience and conduct a thorough public education campaign to ensure Australians do not unknowingly participate in forced organ harvesting in China; 3. Deny visas and bar entry to Chinese officials and policemen who are involved in the persecution of Falun Gong.</span>

As we move down the bullet points of the legislative wording within the emerging technologies documentation, it becomes very apparent that our reality has become the actual words we read.

Also, the TGA has approved novel mRNA therapies with less evidence and further failed to disclose that they did not perform due diligence in assessing their safety. Two parliamentary petitions have already garnered over 100,000 signatures each directed at the TGA's conduct. Last week, alleged fraud was uncovered in the Pfizer vaccine study yet the TGA have taken no action and continue to drive the vaccination of children at risk of life-changing myocarditis. At the same time, AHPRA have told doctors they must not say anything negative about the TGA's vaccines. Over 656 death reports have been submitted to the TGA to date and these reports are not open to public scrutiny. Some may be a direct result of the TGA's influence on AHPRA and the resulting alleged conspiracy to silence doctors. Freedom of Information requests to both boards have been declined. How many more deaths are required before the TGA and AHPRA are investigated for conduct that may be imperiling the lives of Australian citizens? </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In my wife's case she was six months short of her four year resident requirement and being posted overseas added another seven year wait for her to again be eligible for Australian citizenship. This places a burden on ADF families and places them at a disadvantage compared to other Australian families when being unable to say no to overseas military postings in service to Australia.</span>

When spouses and children follow the serviceman or woman, that time in the posted locality is treated as if the time was spent in the home country for immigration matters. The only alternative is for ADF families to be split up for multiple years to keep Australian residency. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The latter is clearly a breach of the human rights of the detainee and amounts to false imprisonment.</span>

The government and Judiciary have been noted suppressing these documents with orders for 90 years, choosing not to investigate as the public would 'lose faith in the judiciary'. The public have already lost faith in the Government and Judiciary. This is compounded by these suppression orders.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Rapid antigen tests are vital in protecting communities from COVID-19. Many have needed to rely on rapid antigen tests because of the extended wait times and inaccessibility of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests. Though the effectiveness varies between the tests, they are a crucial indicator and warning system that can help prevent the spread of infection. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the government's inability to subsidise and provide free rapid antigen tests has endangered the health, time and safety of all Australians. The United Kingdom and Germany are among the few countries that have benefitted their peoples from distributing free, subsidised rapid antigen tests. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The best uses for rapid antigen tests are as a warning system to alert people and their loved ones. The worst uses for rapid antigen tests are for profit and competition. And that is exactly what is happening right now. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the government can stress the importance of getting tested, they cannot take opportunity from people to safely do so. Healthcare infrastructures are already destabilised by the pressure placed on them. Self-testing using rapid antigen test kits would alleviate some of this stress. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to subsidise and make rapid antigen tests, both oral and nasal, free to everyone in Australia. Without reliable contact tracing and overburdened healthcare facilities, it is important to minimise the spread and risk of infection. Funds must be allocated to consistent and accessible rapid antigen tests for people to protect themselves and each other. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Lefevre Peninsula, is divided by ARTC Rail Tracks Freight Line operating 24 hours a day 7 days a week. The eastern side bounded by the Port River, is heavily polluted industrial land, the cause of many deaths, from cancer to asbestosis. The contamination also affects wildlife. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ARTC manages the Freight line on the Peninsula. Numerous documented community requests for a safe corridor, is difficult. ARTC is noncooperative and adopts a reactive approach. Poor maintenance of vegetation, leaves the Community exposed to a hazardous fire risk. Requests for appropriate action are ignored. The fence bounding the residential side is either not suitable for a safe domestic situation, or does not exist at all, leaving access to the ARTC land easily accessible by children who are seen playing on ARTC land.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no noise control for residents living opposite ARTC rail, and ARTC ignores pollution issues. It has poisoned numerous trees, leaving them dead. It does nothing to control the feral animals such as foxes, living on its land, who have no restriction to roam residential areas. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Since its declaration as an independent state in 1991, the Republic of Somaliland has consistently demonstrated its ability to function as a democratic sovereign state, independent of its internationally recognised claimant, the Federal Republic of Somalia. As a champion of liberty and the democratic process, the Commonwealth of Australia should see it not as an option, but as a duty to promote and recognise political entities that demonstrate genuine abilities to function as legitimate, independent sovereign states. This is of particular importance, considering the ongoing instability and conflict in which many of Somaliland's neighbours are currently embroiled in. In a region of such critical importance for international trade and commerce, Australia must make decisive actions to embolden stable, politically compatible allies such as Somaliland. Such recognition will prove key to maintaining the integrity of Australia's foreign interests, in such a critical region.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Young women, particularly single women, have had difficulty in meeting potential partners and fostering romantic relationships over the past two years due to the pandemic. As a result, this has caused a delay in the potential of having children. Over the course of the pandemic, majority of Australians have received some form of pay reduction and/or lost their employment entirely, which also deters women from exploring their fertility options. This is an underlying repercussion of the pandemic that has not received much attention as it is not perceived as urgent compared with the economic implications of lockdowns or even the politics associated with the availability of rapid tests. If people don't have kids and there are no incentives to do so, the economy will suffer moreso in the next decade. This is especially important for Australia, as we are already an ageing population and need to have fertility treatments such as freezing eggs incentivised so that it is more accessible for women and so it can put our minds at ease for future fertility for when we eventually return to some form of normalcy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">When the Federal Government announced the Home Builder Grant (HBG), it was stated that anyone that signed a building contract between 04/06/2020 and 31/12/2020 and met the set requirements, would receive the grant. This was irrespective of completing the online application. This was further reiterated by Minister Sukkar in various interviews. The Minister also assured that applications were just a formality. The deadline was not mentioned in any media releases nor included in the requirements. Due to the high demand for construction and renovations, local councils were overwhelmed and resulted in long delays in building approvals. Also, a shortage of building supplies and Covid-19 restrictions has seen construction time frames extended significantly. Added to this a flawed HBG website and confusing information saw many hard-working Australians unable to apply for this grant even though, according to the Minister for Housing, they are eligible. Recently, the HBG portal has reopened for people who started their applications. However, this was not the case for people who met the requirements but did not start the application. This is because they were unaware of the closing date, caused by a lack of clarity. Missing out on the grant has severely affected my physical and mental health mental.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As I write this, 51,356 positive cases (in one day) have been announced in Victoria. We have a clearly exponential outbreak around the country. The virus is spread just as easily by the vaccinated (just look at the stats). The vaccinated were meant to essentially block transmission. Instead, we've created super spreaders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Hypothetically, if the shot were a placebo, you would expect to see exactly what we are seeing now. It is clear that with over 90% of the population fully vaccinated, if the shots were in any way capable of stopping the spread, we wouldn't be having record breaking exponential case numbers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The country is currently debating Novak Djokovic. The question must be asked, "what difference given the above would it make to cease all discrimination against the unvaccinated?". Honestly? In what way would allowing Novak's entry into Australia in any way harm a population now experiencing an exponential outbreak equally if not primarily (the vaccinated are the majority) spread by the vaccinated? Further, the variant is unquestionably far less severe. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If we must discriminate as a nation, let's look at the biggest risk factor we can alter (through lifestyle choices)? Obesity. If one of the primary risk factors to negative health outcomes (clogging up hospitals) is obesity, why aren't we taking away the rights of the obese? If we wish to get truly dystopian by discarding human rights, why not have BMI mandates? Oh, majority voters</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has proven to be infectious to people vaccinated against the earlier variants of COVID-19. Infection rates have jumped by more than 10 times the maximum recorded prior to Omicron reaching Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Even though Omicron itself might be less lethal than other variants, the infection rate has outstripped the lethality buffer, so it is already more likely that an individual will die from Omicron than they would have from other variants if the infection rate remained low. Additionally, Omicron is likely to mutate into another, more lethal variant which also ignores vaccination.</span>

This more than double the number of faciliated flights we have organised to any other country. Since March 2020, 27,300 Australians registered with DFAT have already returned from India.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Between 27 April and 15 May 2021, the Australian Government announced a number of measures to in response to the increased risk of the COVID-19 outbreak in India.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Concurrently, Australia also providing significant support to assist the Indian Government in their humanitarian response to the outbreak, including the deployment of 37 tonnes of medical supplies. Reflecting our close relationship, Australians donated more than $12.2 million to support India's COVID response through the Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) member organisations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has welcomed the strong leadership role the Indian Government has taken through the pandemic in manufacturing and distributing vaccines to the region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Restrictions on arrivals into Australia carefully balance the interests of Australians seeking to return while managing the risk to public health. The Australian Government's approach in response to the pandemic is based on health advice and outlined in the National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response (National Plan). The National Plan outlines the policy framework for reopening international borders and reducing restrictions gradually with each phase dependent on vaccination thresholds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Phase C of the National Plan will be implemented when at least 80 per cent of the eligible Australian population is vaccinated. It will include gradually reopening inward and outward international travel with safe countries; reducing caps on returning vaccinated Australians; increasing the capped entry of student, economic and humanitarian visa holders; lifting restrictions on outbound travel for vaccinated Australians; and extending travel bubbles for unrestricted travel to new candidate countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is ready to take its next steps to safely reopen to the world, with changes coming to the international border. The Government intended to remove COVID-related restrictions in November to enable fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents to travel internationally and to allow fully vaccinated Australians, including their parents to return to Australia outside of passenger caps.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has published its initial assessment of the data on the protection offered by the Coronavac (Sinovac) and Covishield (AstraZeneca/Serum Institute of India) vaccines. The TGA has advised that these vaccines should be considered as 'recognised vaccines' for the purpose of determining incoming international travellers as being appropriately vaccinated. Declaring certain COVID-19 vaccines as 'recognised vaccines' is separate to a regulatory decision on whether they are approved for use for vaccination in Australia, which has not been made by the TGA. The recognition of these two additional vaccines is a major milestone towards more Australians vaccinated overseas getting home sooner, including those in India.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with our plan to reopen to the world and prioritise the return of Australians, I very much look forward to soon welcoming students, tourists and skilled workers from India to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 August 2021 to the Attorney-General, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, enclosing petition EN2698 with 8 signatures, regarding legislative amendments to capture ransomware payments to cybercriminals as an act of supporting terrorism. Your correspondence was referred to me on 14 September 2021, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is alert to the threat of ransomware, as it continues to grow in impact and remains one of the most disruptive cyber threats to Australian businesses. The Government shares the petition's objective of deterring the payment of ransoms and protecting Australians from the ransomware threat.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response, the Government has released its Ransomware Action Plan to articulate the capabilities and powers that Australia will use to combat ransomware. The plan outlines operational, policy and legislative initiatives that will counter the threat of ransomware.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Initiatives include the development of a ransomware reporting regime which will enable Government to better support victims of ransomware and modernisation of Australia's criminal laws to ensure that cybercriminals are held to account and law enforcement is able to track, seize or freeze their ill-gotten gains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ransomware Action Plan clearly states that the Government does not condone the payment or ransoms to cybercriminals. Any ransom payment, small or large, fuels the ransomware business model, putting other Australians at risk. Working in partnership with industry, the Government will make Australia a harder target for cybercriminals who are putting our businesses and communities at risk.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have copied this letter to the Attorney-General. Thank you for raising this matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 August 2021 enclosing Petition EN2791, with 2380 signatures. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention and apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's current travel restriction policy has played a key foundational role underpinning management of COVID-19's impact on public health in Australia and was implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the difficulties of Skilled Regional (Provisional) visa holders seeking to travel to, or return to Australia, however, the restrictions are in place to manage the health risks posed to the Australian community by international travellers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visa applications for occupations providing critical or specialist medical services, and other applications for occupations in critical sectors of the economy such as agriculture, food production and aged care, are prioritised ahead of all other applications. The Australian Government is also prioritising applications for any visa in non-critical categories for onshore applicants before offshore applicants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be aware that on 6 August 2021, the National Cabinet agreed in full to a four-phase National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response. The National Plan provides a graduated pathway to reopen the international border with each phase triggered once Australia reaches key vaccination thresholds expressed as a percentage of the population who are vaccinated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As Australia progresses through the key vaccination thresholds, the Government is finalising plans so Australian families can be reunited and temporary visa holders including those holding Subclass 489 and Subclass 491 visas can return.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current travel restriction measures are temporary and are reviewed regularly. Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning petition EN2808 requesting to review the specific methods of how the Protheses List Advisory Committee and National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) are approaching the application to list the Omnipod DASH Insulin Delivery System (Omnipod) to ensure that those living with diabetes have responsive and affordable access to diabetes insulin pump technology.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the significant impact diabetes has on people with diabetes and their families and is committed to working towards the broad prevention of the disease in the Australian community. The Omnipod system is a new style of insulin pump for which there are no directly comparable products currently subsidised through the NDSS. The product sponsor for Omnipod has submitted a request for subsidisation of this product and my Department is currently working with the sponsor to identify a potential funding pathway. Depending on the outcome of this process, a decision to list Omnipod on the NDSS product schedule may need to be considered through the Federal Budget process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the OmniPod DASH system is not currently included on the NDSS, a range of insulin pump consumables are currently subsidised. Further information about NDSS products, and more specifically insulin pump consumables, can be found at: www.ndss.com.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides considerable financial support to people with diabetes through the subsidy of essential medicines, like insulin, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and diabetes-related products, like blood glucose test strips, through the NDSS. In 2020-21, PBS expenditure on medicines for diabetes was over $709 million and expenditure on products for diabetes supplied through the NDSS was $186 million.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Not only does the NDSS provide subsidised syringes and needles, blood glucose test strips, urine ketone test strips and insulin pump consumables to people with diabetes, it also provides educational and information services to assist in the best use of products and self-management of diabetes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 October 2021 regarding petition number EN2874, which asks the House of Representatives to progress multiple amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act I984 </span>(Sex Discrimination Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government believes all people are entitled to respect, dignity and the opportunity to participate in society regardless of their personal attributes, and recognises that to enjoy civil and political rights on an equal basis with others, people need to be able to do so free from discrimination. The Sex Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination on the grounds of gender identity, sexual orientation and intersex status in many areas of public life, including employment, education and in the provision of goods, services and facilities. In this context, the Australian Government recognises that individuals may identify and be recognised within the community as a gender other than the sex they were assigned at birth or during infancy, or as a gender which is not exclusively male or female.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to competitive sporting activity, the Sex Discrimination Act provides that it is not unlawful discrimination on the grounds of sex, gender identity or intersex status to exclude a person from participating in competitive sporting activity in which the strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Guidelines for the inclusion of transgender and gender diverse people in sport </span>were developed by the Australian Human Rights Commission in partnership with Sport Australia and the Coalition of Major Professional and Participation Sports. These Guidelines are non-binding. They provide information on the relevant provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and guidance on creating and promoting an inclusive environment in sport. As the Australian Human Rights Commission is an independent statutory agency, the Guidelines are a matter for the Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is not currently considering any changes to the Sex Discrimination Act in relation to these issues. We thank you again for bringing your concerns to the Government's attention. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN2919- Not mandatory for aged care workers to have COVID-19 vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and accepted by the National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public-health orders, effective 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 can be a very serious illness and is especially dangerous for vulnerable people in the community. Vaccination in settings such as aged and health care helps protect workers, vulnerable Australians, and the broader community. Anyone subject to a public-health order must comply with the terms of that order, with significant fines possible for non-compliance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there should be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons. The measures set out in these public-health orders are based on expert health advice on how best to manage the disease in the local community, considering factors such as current and predicted levels of transmission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, considering the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its responsibility in mitigating emerging health threats related to infectious diseases, the AHPPC has already made statements and recommendations on the topic of mandating vaccines for several professions or work types. These can be found at: www.health.gov.au using the search term 'Australia Health Protection Principal Committee'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna vaccines have all been proven through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the safety of the Australian population remains the highest priority of the Government during the rollout, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be guided by expert medical advice of groups such as the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, TGA and AHPPC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 August 2021, National Cabinet agreed to a National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID response to a post-vaccination setting focused on prevention of serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality, similar to the public-health management of other infectious diseases. More information on the National Plan is available on the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's website at: www.pmc.gov.au using the search terms 'national plan'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with the Operation COVID Shield National COVID Vaccine Campaign Plan. For specific information on the vaccine rollout, please visit my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/operation-covid-shield.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, Senator the Hon Marise Payne concerning petition number EN2924, requesting the lifting of travel restrictions, quarantine arrangements and mask-wearing requirements. This matter has been referred to me as the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response (National Plan) sets important vaccination targets to pave the way for Australia to safely reopen.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Implementation of the National Plan is well underway, with large parts of the country soon to move to Phase C.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Phase C, international travel is on track to reopen safely to fully vaccinated Australian travellers. Following completion ofhome quarantine pilots in New South Wales and South Australia, it is anticipated that states and territories that are ready to do so will roll out modified quarantine arrangements for Australian citizens and permanent residents fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved for use in Australia or 'recognised' by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Several jurisdictions have recently announced that fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in those jurisdictions will not have to quarantine on arrival. Mandatory 14-day managed quarantine will still apply for anyone not vaccinated or vaccinated with a vaccine not approved or recognised by the TGA. Australian citizens and permanent residents who cannot be vaccinated- for example if they are under 12 or have a medical condition-will be treated as vaccinated for the purposes of their travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the National Plan, the Australian Government is balancing the need to minimise the risk that the spread ofCOVID-19 presents to communities, with the need to live with the virus. The Government's intention is that once changes are made in November 2021, the current overseas restrictions related to COVID-19 will be removed and Australians will be able to travel subject to any other travel advice and limits as long as they are fully vaccinated and those countries' border settings allow.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health in their respective jurisdictions under their own public health legislation. Public health orders that implement measures including mask-wearing are determined by state and territory governments to manage outbreaks in their jurisdictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These decisions are informed by expert medical advice to reduce the risk of harm caused by disease, especially for those who are most vulnerable, and to protect the capacity of health systems to provide critical support to Australians in need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning Petition EN2925 to stop vaccine trials.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. The safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The urgency of the global pandemic means that researchers, agencies such as the World Health Organisation and governments all over the world are prioritising the development, assessment and rollout ofCOVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a combination of reasons why safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been able to be designed, researched and made available sooner than previously seen. For example:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">expedited review process by regulatory agencies—the TGA is engaging early with pharmaceutical companies about their vaccines and is accepting rolling data.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA undertook an independent and rigorous assessment of the available data for the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The data provided to the TGA was comprehensive and included pre-clinical and clinical studies, non-clinical and toxicology studies, chemistry, manufacturing, risk management and other information. All data was carefully reviewed by a large team of TGA's technical and clinical experts before provisionally approving both vaccines.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Technology using Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been in development for decades, with clinical trials in humans being conducted as early as 2011. The COVID-19 pandemic provided funding and opportunity for researchers who have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines to produce safe and effective vaccines.·</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use a fragment of mRNA to instruct the body to generate an immune response against COVID-19. One dose (0.3ml) of the Pfizer vaccine contains 30 micrograms of mRNA, and one dose (0.5ml) of the Moderna vaccine contains 100 micrograms of mRNA. More information concerning the ingredients ofCOVID-19 vaccines can be found in the Product Information, available at: www.tga.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Based on the naturally occurring process for protein production in our body, mRNA for COVID-19 vaccines is synthetically designed and produced, containing only a short version of the viral mRNA that encodes for the spike protein. mRNA is fragile, which is why it is combined with lipids (fats) that protect it from being degraded until after it has been delivered to the cell. The mRNA enters the muscle cells which make the spike protein, displaying it so that it is recognised by our immune system. This allows the body's natural defences to develop immunity to the disease, so the body is able to rapidly create its own antibodies to prevent disease if it encounters the virus in the future. Once it has provided the instructions for the spike protein, the mRNA is broken down quickly by the body.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It never enters the nucleus and cannot affect or combine with our DNA in any way to change our genetic code or the body's cells. Real world data collated and analysed as part of the global rollout have shown that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are highly effective and safe vaccines.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is also part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development ofCOVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.</span>

There are over 400 trials for 140 vaccine candidates worldwide, including a number that are trialling the use of needle-free technology. These include nasal sprays, oral tablets, skin patches and jet injectors.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN2926—Introduction of Health Pass.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, taking into account the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the particular workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government understands that some businesses are considering whether to require vaccination as a condition of service or entry. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions, and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises. However, anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can already provide voluntary proof of vaccination by accessing their immunisation history statement through Medicare Online, via the Express Plus Medicare mobile app or via their My Health Record. People can seek a hard copy of their immunisation history statement by contacting the Australian Immunisation enquiries line, or through their doctor or immunisation provider.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government, through Services Australia and my Department, has also developed a safe and secure COVID-19 Digital Certificate, which may help Australians provide proof of vaccination if it were required. For those who have had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, they can apply for a temporary exemption from a COVID-19 vaccine that will enable them to generate a COVID-19 Digital Certificate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 August 2021, National Cabinet agreed to a National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID response from its current pre-vaccination settings, focusing on continued suppression of community transmission, to post-vaccination settings focused on prevention of serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality, and the public-health management of other infectious diseases.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN2936 to make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its responsibility in mitigating emerging health threats related to infectious diseases, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) has released statements on the topic ofCOVID-19 vaccines for several professions. These can be found at: www.health.gov.au using the search terms 'Australian Health Protection Principal Committee'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While these statements may be considered best advice and practice, the Australian Government has only made COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for those working in residential aged care, which was accepted by National Cabinet and effective from 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 can be a very serious illness and is especially dangerous for vulnerable people in the community. Vaccination in high-risk settings helps to protect workers, vulnerable Australians, and the broader community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have seen fit to issue public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in additional high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individual businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises. However, the choice to require COVID-19 vaccination for workers or customers needs careful consideration, considering the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government encourages employers and workers to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safety of the Australian population remains the highest priority of the Government during the rollout. As such, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines, including consideration of mandates, will continue to be guided by expert medical advice of groups such as the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, Therapeutic Goods Administration and the AHPPC.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021, concerning petition EN2939 to prohibit mandatory vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and accepted by the National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public-health orders, effective 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, taking into account the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the particular workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands that some businesses are considering whether to require vaccination as a condition of service or entry. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions, and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises. However, anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there should be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 August 2021, National Cabinet agreed to a National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID response to a post-vaccination setting focused on prevention of serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality, like the public-health management of other infectious diseases. More information on the National Plan is available on the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's website at: www.pmc.gov.au using the search term 'national plan'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its responsibility &lt;in mitigating emerging health threats related to infectious diseases, the AHPPC has already made statements and recommendations on the topic of mandating vaccines for several professions or work types. These can be found at: www.health.gov.au using the search terms 'Australia Health Protection Principal Committee'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a COVID-19 vaccine can be legally supplied in Australia, it must be approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and it will be subject to well-established and rigorous assessment and approval process to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks. The TGA's vaccine safety monitoring system can rapidly detect, investigate and respond to any emerging safety issues identified for COVID 19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna vaccines have all been proven through the TGA approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Family Law</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 October 2021 regarding Petition No EN2942, presented to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions. The petition requests legislative change to provide for a default position of 50/50 shared post-separation care arrangements in the absence of a Family Court Order and Apprehended Violence Order or abuse claims. As Attorney-General, the family law system falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Act 1975 </span>provides a legal framework for resolving arrangements for children and prope1iy following a relationship breakdown. When couples separate they are encouraged to resolve issues themselves without going to court. This is more likely to save them time, money and stress. It also enables them to work out and, if necessary, vary care arrangements so that they can meet the needs of their children and also meet the demands and schedules of the parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has produced a handbook on parenting orders—'Parenting Orders- what you need to know'. The handbook aims to help separated parents agree on arrangements for their children, and support them to develop workable, child-focussed parenting orders. This handbook can be accessed at the website of the Attorney-General's Department.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Law Act requires separated couples needing to resolve parenting arrangements to make a genuine effort at family dispute resolution before attending court, unless one of the exceptions applies—such as family violence, child abuse or urgency. Where the parties cannot reach agreement the matter may progress to the family law courts for resolution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 'best interests of the child' is the paramount consideration of the court when resolving parenting matters. This includes the need to protect children from harm and, in the absence of factors such as violence or abuse, for children to enjoy a meaningful relationship with each of their parents. The Family Law Act is gender neutral and does not predispose any gender or parent as a primary care giver. The Family Law Act focuses on the rights of children and the responsibilities that each parent has towards their children, rather than on parental rights. The court will give consideration to a range of factors when determining parenting arrangements that. are in a child's best interests, including the age and developmental needs of the child.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Law Act recognises that each parent has parental responsibility for a child, unless specifically displaced by a parenting· order made by a court. If a parenting matter is before a court for determination, the court must apply a presumption in favour of 'equal shared parental responsibility', unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent, or a person the child lives with, has engaged in family violence or child abuse. If the court proceeds to makes orders for parents to have equal shared parental responsibility, this means that both parents have an equal role in making decisions about major long-term issues affecting the child, such as where a child goes to school or major health issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The presumption of equal shared parental responsibility was a key feature of significant reforms to the family law system in 2006. In its response to the Australian Law Reform Commission's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law for the Future -An inquiry into the family law system </span>(ALRC Report), the Government reaffirmed its commitment to the policy underlying the presumption, which is that children will generally benefit from both parents being involved in making important decisions affecting their lives post-separation, provided this is safe and consistent with their best interests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Equal shared parental responsibility does not mean spending equal time with a child. Parents will only spend equal time with a child where they can agree to this outcome, or where a court finds that equal time is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable in the circumstances. Where parents have equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether it is appropriate and reasonably practicable for the child to spend equal time with both parents. If it is not, the court must consider whether 'substantial and significant time' (including day-to-day routine—not just weekends or holidays) is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable. In its response to the ALRC Report, the Government also reaffirmed that it continues to suppo1i such a requirement that courts appropriately consider children spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each parent where an order for shared parental responsibility has been made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that going through family law proceedings is a difficult experience and it is common for people to require professional support. As this petition raises the mental health impact of post separation care arrangements of children on men in particular, I note that the Australian Government funds Mensline Australia, a service which provides online counselling, info1mation and referrals. Mensline Australia is available to men, partners and families who are interested in learning more about how to access personal support or to support the men in their life. Information and support is also available through non-profit organisations such as Lifeline and Beyond Blue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN2948, originally directed to the Treasurer, which requests churches of all denominations pay tax on the basis they are run as businesses. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no general provision in Commonwealth tax legislation that exempts churches or other religious bodies from taxation. However, an entity registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) as a charity is eligible for tax concessions, including an exemption from income tax.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To become registered with the ACNC an organisation must be a charity which includes having only charitable purposes. Charitable purpose has a legal meaning, developed over 400 years by firstly, the United Kingdom, and later Australian, courts and Parliament. The courts have recognised many different charitable purposes, and as society changes new charitable purposes have been recognised. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Charities Act 2013, </span>which defines what is a charity, recognises twelve such purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the charitable purposes listed under the Charities Act is the purpose of advancing religion. Religion has been accepted as a charitable purpose since the 1600s and the current Charities Act is based on this substantial body of case law. Comparable international jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand also consider religion a charitable purpose that benefits the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that organisations with the purpose of advancing religion are eligible for registration with the ACNC provided they meet all the eligibility criteria. Likewise, registered religious charities may apply in the same way as all other charities to access charitable tax concessions, including the income tax exemption, provided they meet all the eligibility criteria. Organisations with the purpose of advancing religion have the same registration requirements as organisations that have one of many other charitable purposes. The test for charitable purpose is not specifically a religious one.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, registration with the ACNC requires an entity to operate on a not-for-profit basis. This means the assets and income of the entity are used only for the purposes for which the entity is established and not for the private benefit of the members of the entity. This is the core difference with a taxable for-profit business that operates for the private gain of its owners. A church that does not meet the not-for-profit test is not eligible for registration as a charity and is not exempt from income tax.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that charities can engage in commercial activities provided this is ancillary to, and in furtherance of, their charitable purposes rather than for private gain. An example is running a shop whose operating surplus is used to fund the activities of the charity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Vaccination</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021, concerning petition EN2951 not to make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and accepted by the National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public-health orders, effective 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 can be a very serious illness and is especially dangerous for vulnerable people in the community. Vaccination in settings such as aged care helps protect workers, vulnerable Australians, and the broader community. Anyone subject to a public-health order must comply with the terms of that order, with significant fines possible for non-compliance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, taking into account the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the particular workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there should be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 August 2021, National Cabinet agreed to a National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID response to a post-vaccination setting focused on prevention of serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality, similar to the public-health management of other infectious diseases. More information on the National Plan is available on the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's website at: www.pmc.gov.au using the search terms 'national plan'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its responsibility in mitigating emerging health threats related to infectious diseases, the AHPPC has already made statements and recommendations on the topic of mandating vaccines for several professions or work types. These can be found at: www.health.gov.au using the search term 'Australia Health Protection Principal Committee'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna vaccines have all been proven through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the safety of the Australian population remains the highest priority of the Government during the rollout, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be guided by expert medical advice of groups such as the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, TGA and AHPPC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with the Operation COVID Shield National COVID Vaccine Campaign Plan. For specific information on the vaccine rollout, please visit my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/operation-covid-shield. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">1 refer to your correspondence of 19 October 2021 concerning Petition EN2966 asking the House to compel government and media sources to provide accurate data on COVID-19 related deaths.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate that the petitioners are concerned about the reporting of deaths in people who have contracted COVID-19 or received a COVID-19 vaccine. However, aspects of the request are not within the remit of my Department, including how state and territory governments and the media report COVID-19 deaths.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I will address the petitioners' concerns about reporting of vaccine-related deaths.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which is part of my Department, is responsible for safety monitoring and reporting of adverse events following vaccination, including deaths.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has a well-established and robust system in place to capture reports of suspected adverse events for all vaccines. Many of these processes have been enhanced dramatically</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">for COVID-19 vaccines, making this the most intense safety monitoring of therapeutic goods ever conducted in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA encourages people to report suspected vaccine adverse events, even if there is only a small chance that the vaccine caused them. This helps the TGA to identify signals (patterns or signs in the data) which may reveal potential safety issues. The TGA undertakes investigations of signals to assess whether the vaccine is causing certain types of adverse events.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the TGA reviews all deaths reported in people post-administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. Their analysis of individual reports and patterns of reporting does not suggest that the vaccines played a causal role in the vast majority of these cases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sadly, more than 3,000 people die in Australia every week. We are vaccinating almost an entire population, including people who are elderly and at risk of severe disease. It is inevitable that there will be people who experience a serious health issue or die in the days following vaccination for various reasons. These reasons will often be unrelated to vaccination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA reports on deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines transparently and accurately. Each week, they report on the COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring at: www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This report includes details on the number of deaths reported to the TGA, as well as the outcomes of their assessment of those reports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since the beginning of the vaccine rollout to 24 October 2021, approximately 34.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been given. So far, the TGA has found nine reports of death which were linked to immunisation from 629 reports received and reviewed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I assure you that, if the TGA suspects there is a safety issue with a COVID-19 vaccine, it will immediately conduct a thorough investigation. If the safety concern is confirmed, the TGA will respond appropriately, including communication to the Australian public.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the latest worldwide safety data continues to show that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks of the adverse effects caused by the vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition number EN2973 requesting transparency of vaccine safety information and choice of vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.

              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. Some states and territories have now issued public-health orders which require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is working closely with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisations and all state and territory health departments to ensure that monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety is of the highest possible standard in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia. All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and/or disease. All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is open and transparent about safety information relating to COVID-19 vaccines, including any suspected side effects or potential safety issues. The TGA publishes a weekly safety report, including information about reported suspected side effects, as well as other safety alerts as required. More information can be found at: www.tga.gov.au using the search terms 'COVID-19-vaccine safety monitoring and reporting'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The goal is to protect all people in Australia from the harm caused COVID-19 infection. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna vaccines have all been proven through approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a means of increasing choice of vaccines available in Australia, the Government has invested in a diverse portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines that use a variety of technical platforms, entering into five separate Advance Purchase Agreements for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines, if they prove to be safe and effective. These include agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Moderna and the international COVAX. Combined, these agreements will ensure Australia has access to more than 280 million vaccine doses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being used in the rollout, while the TGA has granted the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine a provisional determination and the vaccine is currently under evaluation. Although it is not yet approved for use in Australia or elsewhere in the world, the evaluation of Novavax is being significantly expedited without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy. Should the Novavax vaccine candidate be found to be safe and effective, it is expected the 51 million ordered doses will begin rollout as early as December 2021.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Emergency measures have been necessary to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With more than 4.9 million deaths globally in around 22 months, Australia's strong and decisive response has put Australia in a very fortunate position compared to so many other countries across the world.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In declaring the human biosecurity emergency period under section 475 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015 </span>(Act), Australia acted decisively to address a risk assessed under the Act as posing a severe and immediate threat to human health on a nationally significant scale.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has not yet made any decision about whether the period will be extended again. The Government is continuing to closely monitor the evolving evidence relevant to the assessment of public health risk, including the impact of measures such as the vaccine rollout. A decision will be announced in due course.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN2995 calling on the Government to hold a referendum to determine if the COVID-19 vaccine is safe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID- 19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. The safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and accepted by National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public-health orders, effective 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, considering the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the particular workplace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government understands that some businesses are considering whether to require vaccination as a condition of service or entry. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises. However, anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there should be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has not taken any decision on whether an individual's vaccination status will facilitate changes to current public-health measures. States and territories may consider the potential future value of COVID-19 digital certificates when considering automatic travel exemptions for interstate travel during state-determined lockdowns and travel restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can already provide voluntary proof of vaccination by accessing their immunisation history statement through Medicare Online, via the Express Plus Medicare mobile app or via their My Health Record. People can seek a hard copy of their immunisation history statement by contacting the Australian Immunisation enquiries line, or through their doctor or immunisation provider.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government, through Services Australia and my Department, has also developed a safe and secure COVID-19 Digital Certificate, which may help Australians provide proof of vaccination if it were required. The certificate is already available through the Medicare Express app for those who wish to use it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a prescription medicine (including a COVID-19 vaccine) can be legally supplied in Australia, it must be approved for use by the TGA and it will be subject to well-established and rigorous assessment and approval process of the TGA to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TOA is also part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development ofCOVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers, and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts globally. There are more than 400 trials for 140 vaccine candidates worldwide, including a number that are trialling the use of needle-free technology. These include nasal sprays, oral tablets, skin patches and jet injectors.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3006 for no COVID-19 vaccine mandates especially for aged care works.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and accepted by the National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public-health orders, effective 17 September 2021</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on public health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state and territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 can be a very serious illness and is especially dangerous for vulnerable people in the community. Vaccination in settings such as aged care and health care helps to protect workers, vulnerable Australians, and the broader community. Anyone subject to a public health order must comply with the terms of that orders, with significant fines possible for non-compliance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees.

The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there should be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 October 2021 regarding Petition EN3011, which requests a referendum to alter the Constitution to include a right for citizens to 'bear arms of any caliber or type' without a permit or background check. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, responsibility for firearms matters is shared between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. The Commonwealth Government is responsible only for matters relating to the import and export of firearms, while the state and territory governments have responsibility for all matters relating to possession, licensing and use of firearms. Any issues relating to the possession and licensing of firearms are therefore principally a matter for the relevant state or territory government.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">So far as constitutional change is concerned, section 128 of the Constitution generally requires any proposed change to be approved by both houses of Parliament and by double majorities of electors (a majority overall and majorities in at least 4 of the 6 states). This mechanism ensures that only those referendum proposals with very widespread support can succeed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising the far greater risk that COVID-19 presents to older Australians, the Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and accepted by the National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public health orders, effective 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, have implemented a range of measures using their own public-health and emergency-management legislation to contain the spread of COVID-19 and keep the community safe. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also mandated COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees. Workplace health and safety is a matter for individual employers and employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under model work health safety laws, employers are required to manage risks of viral exposure and infection, and persons at a workplace are required to comply, so far as they are reasonably able, with any reasonable instruction in that regard. Whether to require COVID- 19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, considering the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory in any setting, there should be exemptions in place for those unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some individuals may not be able to receive a COVID-19 vaccination due to a medical condition, or where their health, age or disability mean that the benefits of the vaccination do not outweigh the risk of adverse events. Additionally, some age cohorts may not yet have been able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Mandatory COVID-19 vaccination requirements that apply to everyone may indirectly discriminate against these cohorts. Indirect discrimination is not unlawful if it is reasonable in all the circumstances. Implications for Australia's anti-discrimination laws should be considered when mandating COVID-19 vaccinations without exemptions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Human Rights Commission has published guidance on discrimination law considerations in relation to COVID-19 vaccine mandates, which is available via: www.humanrights.gov.au/about/covid19-and-human-rights/.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government takes its obligations under international human rights law seriously and implements those obligations in good faith. The Government considers that the measures it has adopted in response to COVID-19 are consistent with international human rights law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Informed consent should be obtained for every COVID-19 vaccination, as per usual consent procedures for other vaccinations. To this end, the Government has made expert health advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) available to assist people with their decision-making, which is available at: www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/covid-19-vaccination-patient-resources.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to provide a wide range of guidance material to the public on COVID-19 vaccines and legal frameworks, and to encourage vaccination uptake by communicating about the safety, science, evidence, and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before any COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use in Australia, it is subject to the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) stringent assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large trials of thousands of people. These trials have shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and protecting individuals against severe illness or death associated with COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These TGA approvals are subject to certain strict conditions, such as the requirement for sponsors to provide information to the TGA on longer-term efficacy and safety from ongoing trials and post-market assessment. More information on this TGA evaluation process can be found at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines. Further, the ATAGI is closely monitoring reports of other rare adverse events following immunisation and updating their advice and recommendations as new evidence arises.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Most side effects from COVID-19 vaccinations are mild and go away in a couple of days. Serious reactions are extremely rare. The protective benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, including preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19, significantly outweighs any rare risks from COVID-19 vaccination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While vaccination remains the best protection against COVID-19, the Government also continues work to ensure that Australians have early access to safe and effective treatments. Building on Australia's diverse and large portfolio of COVID-19 treatments (including remdesivir and sotrovimab) already being used to treat patients with COVID-19 across the country, the Government has recently secured access to additional COVID-19 treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These promising treatments are Ronapreve, Molnupiravir, and Pfizer's COVID-19 oral antiviral drug (to be used in combination with the protease inhibitor drug ritonavir).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Anyone with questions on COVID-19 vaccination is encouraged to talk to a health professional.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3025—Supplying AstraZeneca Vaccines to Australians/Permanent Residents stuck overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Providing all Australians with access to effective COVID-19 vaccines is a key priority for the Australian Government. The rollout and distribution ofCOVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with Australia's COVID-19 Vaccine National Rollout Strategy. The rollout of the domestic Australian vaccination program does not include Australians overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has been closely following the situation across the world. We recognise the need to work with our neighbours and will provide support to ensure that their vaccine rollouts are safe, quick and effective and our region is able to return to normal as soon as possible and is engaged in a number of ways to enable this to occur.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's five COVID-19 vaccine agreements with: Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), Novavax, Moderna and COVAX Facility- allow us to support our Pacific and South East Asian neighbours, as vaccine doses can be donated or on-sold (with no mark-up) to other countries or international organisations should these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians living overseas should consult a local health professional for advice on what vaccination choices are available locally. The Government cannot provide advice on the safety, quality or effectiveness of vaccines that have not been approved using Australia's regulatory processes. Work is underway to support the recognition of vaccines which people have received overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation are working to identify the overseas vaccines currently available internationally and to assess the protection offered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If people receive a TGA-approved COVID-19 vaccine overseas, they can register their vaccination on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) when they return to Australia. Currently, only COVID-19 vaccines registered for use in Australia by the TGA can be reported to the AIR.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As announced on 1 October 2021, the TOA has published its initial assessment of the data on the protection offered by the Coronavac (Sinovac) and Covishield (AstraZeneca/Serum Institute of India) vaccines and has advised that these vaccines should be considered as 'recognised vaccines' for the purpose of determining incoming international travellers as being appropriately vaccinated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Declaring certain COVID-19 vaccines as 'recognised vaccines' is separate to a regulatory decision on whether they are approved for use for vaccination in Australia, which has not been made by the TOA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The recognition of these two additional vaccines is a major milestone towards more Australians vaccinated overseas getting home sooner. Work is underway to permit these two vaccines to be recorded in the AIR.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TOA will continue its assessment of other vaccines for the purpose of determining 'recognised vaccines' based on the available data and data that is provided.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence on 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3026—No National Emergency Vaccinations, No Martial Law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that this is a challenging time for all Australians and understands the impact of these measures on individuals, families and businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges that many people will find that their faith or beliefs give them comfort in these difficult times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Constitution provides that every member of the Australian Parliament, before taking his or her seat, must make and subscribe an oath or affirmation of allegiance before the Governor-General, or some person authorised by the Governor-General. The oath is usually made on a Bible or on another holy book and ends with the words 'So help me God!'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is the main context in which oaths are made by members of the Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners are requesting that an oath rejecting COVID-19 vaccination and public-health measures be introduced to the Australian Parliament. I imagine that this request may be informed by feelings of anxiety about COVID-19 and by a desire for citizens to return to the routines they had prior to the pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. The safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk-management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is also part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, considering the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has not taken any decision on whether an individual's vaccination status will facilitate changes to current public-health measures. States and territories may consider the potential future value of COVID-19 digital certificates when considering automatic travel exemptions for interstate travel during state-determined lockdowns and travel restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can already provide voluntary proof of vaccination by accessing their immunisation history statement through Medicare Online, via the Express Plus Medicare mobile app or via their My Health Record. People can seek a hard copy of their immunisation history statement by contacting·the Australian Immunisation enquiries line, or through their doctor or immunisation provider.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021, concerning petition EN3029 No mandatory vaccine for disability workers or community service professionals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and accepted by the National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public-health orders, effective 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there should be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons. The measures set out in these public-health orders are based on expert health advice on how best to manage the disease in the local community, considering factors such as the levels of transmission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, considering the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 can be a very serious illness and is especially dangerous for vulnerable people in the community. Vaccination in all settings helps to protect workers, vulnerable Australians, and the broader community. Anyone subject to a public-health order must comply with the terms of that order, with significant fines possible for non-compliance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its responsibility in mitigating emerging health threats related to infectious diseases, the AHPPC has already made statements and recommendations on the topic of mandating vaccines for several professions or work types. These can be found at: www.health.gov.au using the search term 'Australia Health Protection Principal Committee'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In their statement addressing vaccination recommendations for residential disability support workers, they noted the importance that had been placed on this population by the Government prioritising disability support workers in the early 1a and 1b phases of the rollout. Support has also been given to GPs in the form of remuneration for providing in-home vaccinations for individuals with disability. This has resulted in greater protection of both this population, their support workers and the broader community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna vaccines have all been proven through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the safety of the Australian population remains the highest priority of the Government during the rollout, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be guided by expert medical advice of groups such as the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), TGA and AHPPC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 August 2021, National Cabinet agreed to a National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID response to a post-vaccination setting focused on prevention of serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality, like the public-health management of other infectious diseases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More information on the National Plan is available on the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's website at: www.pmc.gov.au using the search term 'national plan'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with the Operation COVID Shield National COVID Vaccine Campaign Plan. For specific information on the vaccine rollout please visit my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/operation-covid-shield.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition number EN3035 requesting that the Australian Government and State Governments stop using the term 'case' for people who have tested positive for SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has coordinated an evidence-based response to the COVID-19 pandemic, informed by the latest public health advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and its expert standing committees, including the Public Health Laboratory Network and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CDNA has developed COVID-19 case definitions for epidemiological purposes in order to rapidly detect people infected with SARS-CoV-2, investigate the source of infection and ensure there are no unrecognised chains of transmission in the community. Case definitions are described in the Series of National Guidelines, available at: www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cdna-song-novel-coronavirus.htm.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Cases who meet the confirmed case definition are notified as COVID-19 cases to the National Interoperable Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. It is important to note that a person can still be a confirmed case and not display any symptoms as some SARS-CoV-2 infections remain asymptomatic. All confirmed cases have potential for transmission irrespective of the presence of symptoms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Laboratory-based Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing is the gold standard test used to diagnose acute COVID-19 infection. This test method is very sensitive and detects nucleic acid sequences specific to the virus. Although it is possible that a positive PCR test may occur in the absence of acute infection, the CDNA Series of National Guidelines addresses this issue by categorising infections that are historical in nature.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Petitions Committee can be assured that the my Department, along with the states and territories, is taking an evidence-based approach to COVID-19 and is committed to keep Australians safe.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your recent email regarding petition number EN3041 on reprisals against protestors in Iran.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The human rights situation in Iran is concerning and one which the Australian Government takes seriously. Australia has been consistent in urging Iranian authorities to exercise restraint in response to protests. At the 46th session of the UN Human Rights Council in March 2021, Australia called on Iran to safeguard freedom of expression and ensure that activists did not face intimidation. On 10 August 2021 in a speech to the Senate, I publicly called on Iran to cease abuses of human rights.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 October 2021, Australia made a statement to the UN General Assembly calling on Iran to improve compliance with international human rights law and uphold international standards including fair trials and due process. As co-sponsor of this year's annual UNGA Third Committee Resolution on the situation of human rights in Iran, Australia has worked with member states to ensure the resolution called on Iran to uphold the human rights of those involved in peaceful protests.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. The safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the TGA' s rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves a comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The urgency of the global pandemic means that researchers, agencies such as the World Health Organization and governments all over the world are prioritising the development, assessment and rollout ofCOVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a combination of reasons why safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been able to be designed, researched and made available sooner than previously seen. For example:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has provisionally approved Pfizer and Moderna for use in people aged 12 years or older. In doing so, the TGA undertook an independent and rigorous assessment of the available data for the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The data provided to the TGA was comprehensive and included pre-clinical and clinical studies, non-clinical and toxicology studies, chemistry, manufacturing, risk management and other information.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Technology using Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been in development for decades, with clinical trials in humans being conducted as early as 2011. The COVID-19 pandemic provided funding and opportunity for researchers who have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines to produce safe and effective vaccines.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use a fragment of mRNA to instruct the body to generate an immune response against COVID-19. One dose (0.3ml) of the Pfizer vaccine contains 30 micrograms of mRNA, and one dose (0.5ml) of the Moderna vaccine contains 100 micrograms of mRNA. More information concerning the ingredients ofCOVID-19 vaccines can be found in the Product Information (PI) available at: www.tga.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Based on the naturally occurring process for protein production in our body, mRNA for COVID-19 vaccines is synthetically designed and produced, containing only a short version of the viral mRNA that encodes for the spike protein. mRNA is fragile, which is why it is combined with lipids (fats) that protect it from being degraded until after it has been delivered to the cell. The mRNA enters the muscle cells which make the spike protein, displaying it so that it is recognised by our immune system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This allows the body's natural defences to develop immunity to the disease, so the body can rapidly create its own antibodies to prevent disease if it encounters the virus in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Once it has provided the instructions for the spike protein, the mRNA is broken down quickly by the body. It never enters the nucleus and cannot affect or combine with our DNA in any way to change our genetic code or the body's cells. Real world data collated and analysed as part of the global rollout have shown that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are highly effective and safe vaccines.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is also part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development ofCOVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 October 2021, all Australians aged 12 years and over, including those Australians aged 60 years and over, are now eligible to receive a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are now almost 10,000 sites where individuals can get a vaccine, and by mid-October 2021 we will have enough vaccine in the country for everyone who is eligible to be double-dosed. In addition, thousands of pharmacies are now active, providing a great opportunity for those aged 60 years and over, and their families, who will now be able to walk into their community pharmacy and have all family members aged 12 years and over vaccinated.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. Moreover, the safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia. All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's health product regulator, the TGA, has provisionally approved Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines for use in people aged 12 years and over.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following this, the ATAGI has reviewed available data on the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine in children aged 12 to 15 years, the risk of COVID 19 in this age group, and evidence of wider benefits and risks of vaccinating children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ATAGI has also reviewed available evidence on specific medical conditions in children that have been identified to be associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) vaccines-the other COVID-19 vaccines provisionally approved for use in Australia-are not currently registered or recommended in Australia for use in children under 18 years. This is because, at this stage, there are limited clinical trial results showing that they are effective and safe in these age groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is currently no evidence to suggest that children will not be able to receive these particular vaccines in the future. Guidance will be revised when evidence on the efficacy and safety of children receiving these COVID-19 vaccines becomes available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 September 2021 Pfizer and BioNTech announced top-line results from a Phase 2/3 trial for their mRNA COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer in participants aged 5 to 11 years. The results are the first from a pivotal trial (typically a Phase 3 clinical trial) of any COVID-19 vaccine in children under 12 years of age. In participants 5 to 11 years of age, the vaccine was safe, well-tolerated and showed robust neutralising antibody response, demonstrating a strong immune response one month after the second dose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Companies plan to submit this data to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency and other regulatory agencies around the world as soon as possible. Submission for full FDA approval is expected as they continue to accumulate the required safety and efficacy data under the existing 'Emergency Use Authorisation' (EUA) in this age group.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-reviewed publication. Results in children under 5 years of age are expected in late 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'EUA' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The urgency of the global pandemic means that researchers, agencies such as the World Health Organization and governments all over the world are prioritising the development, assessment and rollout ofCOVID-19 vaccines.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a combination of reasons why safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been able to be designed, researched and made available sooner than previously seen. For example:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">technology-the evolution of technology has allowed vaccines to be developed at a faster pace than in the past. New technologies have helped scientists understand the coronavirus and its make-up more easily, which has allowed them to start working on vaccine design more quickly</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that the TGA can accept, review and assess clinical trial data as it becomes available, rather than all at once at the end of the three clinical trial phases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes including clinical trials. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA requires robust scientific data before supporting a vaccine candidate and will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is found to be safe and effective, following its complete assessment of data.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Immunisation Handbook (Handbook) has information about 'valid consent', including criteria for consent to be legally valid. The Handbook states that, in general, a parent or legal guardian of a child has the authority to consent to that child being vaccinated. Some Australian states and territories have legislation that addresses the issue of a child's consent to medical treatment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The common law applies in the states and territories that do not have specific legislation relating to children's consent to medical treatment. This common-law position is often referred to as Mature Minor or Gillick competence.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For certain procedures, including vaccination, a child or adolescent may be determined to be mature enough to understand the proposed procedure, and the risks and benefits associated with it. These young people may have the capacity to consent under certain circumstances.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has provisionally approved the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines for use in people aged 12 years or older. In doing so, the TGA undertook an independent and rigorous assessment of the available data for the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is also part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3073—Stop discrimination of Australians not taking the experimental COVID19 vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and accepted by the National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public-health orders, effective 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders which require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, considering the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government understands that some businesses are considering whether to require vaccination as a condition of service or entry. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there should be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 can be a very serious illness and is especially dangerous for vulnerable people in the community. Vaccination in settings such as aged care and health care helps to protect workers, vulnerable Australians, and the community. Anyone subject to a public-health order must comply with the terms of that order, with significant fines possible for non-compliance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 August 2021, National Cabinet agreed to a National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 response to a post-vaccination setting focused on prevention of serious illness, hospitalisation and death, similar to the public-health management of other infectious diseases. More information on the National Plan is available on the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's website at: www.pmc.gov.au using the search term 'national plan'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its responsibility in mitigating emerging health threats related to infectious diseases, the AHPPC has already made statements and recommendations on the topic of mandating vaccines for several professions or work types. These can be found at: www.health.gov.au using the search terms 'Australia Health Protection Principal Committee'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to provide guidance to businesses on vaccination matters to encourage uptake within the community. There is a wide range of guidance material available to clarify the legal framework around workplace vaccination and help businesses and workers make informed decisions. Various perspectives on the topic can be found on the Fair Work Ombudsman, Safe Work Australia, Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and Australian Human Rights Commission websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a COVID-19 vaccine can be legally supplied in Australia, it must be approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and it will be subject to well-established and rigorous assessment and approval process to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks. The TGA's vaccine safety monitoring system can rapidly detect, investigate and respond to any emerging safety issues identified for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna vaccines have all been-proven through the TGA approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the safety of the Australian population remains the highest priority of the Government during the rollout, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be guided by expert medical advice of groups such as the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), TGA and AHPPC.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 19 October 2021 concerning petition number EN3080, requesting compassionate travel exemptions to facilitate perinatal support by grandparents and increased funding for perinatal services to ameliorate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recently announced changes to international travel exemptions that will make it possible for overseas parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents to apply for an exemption to travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 November 2021, the definition of 'immediate family member' will be broadened to include the parents of adult Australian citizens and permanent residents. This will make it possible for the parents of new and expecting parents to travel to Australia and provide support of the kind described in the petition. The broadened definition will include biological parents, legal (including adoptive) parents, step parents and parents-in-law. The new arrangements including requirements travellers would need to meet, are described on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: www.covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/immediate-family-australian-citizens-or-permanent-residents-or-new-zealand-citizens-usually-resident-australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For new or expecting parents seeking the support of their parents from elsewhere within Australia, where state-determined domestic border restrictions are in place, exemptions from those restrictions will continue to be a matter for the relevant state and territory governments, as would any quarantine requirements. State and territory governments remain responsible for emergency management and public health in their respective jurisdictions, under their own public health legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the mental health impact both the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures needed to contain it have had on a wide range of individuals and communities including new and expecting parents. The Government recognised these severe impacts early in the pandemic and announced a range of emergency response measures to support the mental health and wellbeing of all Australians during this pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A number of services were introduced or scaled up to support early intervention among vulnerable groups, including new and expecting parents, Indigenous cohorts, older Australians and young people. Increased funding was provided for Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia to bolster its free helpline (1300 726 306) and to produce new toolkits and resources to support expecting and new parents cope with increased stress and anxiety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Telehealth services were expanded to ensure that Australians can continue to access their mental health treatment services by videoconferencing or telephone. A targeted mental health communications campaign was undertaken to keep the conversation going about mental health as the full impacts of the pandemic emerged.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The resources provided on the Government's digital mental health gateway Head to Health were also expanded, giving people access to trusted mental health information and services.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021, concerning petition EN3083 calling on the Australian Government to stop the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. Moreover, the safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The urgency of the global pandemic means that researchers, agencies such as the World Health Organization and governments all over the world are prioritising the development, assessment and rollout ofCOVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a combination of reasons why safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been able to be designed, researched and made available sooner than previously seen. For example:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">unprecedented levels of funding-the pandemic is a global priority and governments around the world are investing in research and manufacturing facilities</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">technology-the evolution of technology has allowed vaccines to be developed at a faster pace than in the past. New technologies have helped scientists understand the coronavirus and its make-up more easily, which has allowed them to start working on vaccine design more quickly</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">combined clinical trials-in response to the pandemic, some pharmaceutical companies have combined clinical trial phases 1 and 2</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">expedited review process by regulatory agencies-the TGA is engaging early with pharmaceutical companies about their vaccines and is accepting rolling data. This means that the TGA can accept, review and assess clinical trial data as it becomes available, rather than all at once at the end of the three clinical trial phases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes including clinical trials. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA requires robust scientific data before supporting a vaccine candidate and will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is found to be safe and effective, following its complete assessment of data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to your concern about vaccination of pregnant women, global evidence shows that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are safe for pregnant women. There is no evidence of increased risk of miscarriage or teratogenic risk. Pregnant women were not included in the first clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, so there was limited evidence confirming the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. This meant the initial advice from immunisation expert groups was cautious. But over time, 'real-world' evidence from other countries grew and showed that Pfizer and Moderna are safe to use in pregnancy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts globally. There are more than 400 trials for 140 vaccine candidates worldwide, including a number that are trialling the use of needle-free technology. These include nasal sprays, oral tablets, skin patches and jet injectors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with the Operation COVID Shield National COVID Vaccine Campaign Plan. For specific information on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, please visit my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/operation-covid-shield.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN3086—The Australian Government pass law reforms to prevent digital currency as being the only choice. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian banknotes are legal tender under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Reserve Bank Act (1959), </span>and coins are legal tender for payment of certain amounts defined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Currency Act (1965). </span>However, while Australian banknotes and coins have legal tender status, a refusal to accept legal tender banknotes and/or coins is not unlawful. This means a business is free to make a commercial decision to refuse certain types of payment, regardless of whether this is legal tender such as notes and coins or another payment method such as cheque or credit card.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Providers of goods and services are able to specify what forms of payment they will accept prior to entering into a transaction. If a provider specifies other means of payment prior to the transaction, then there is no obligation for legal tender banknotes or coins to be accepted as payment. The recent trend towards cashless payments is the result of consumers and businesses choosing the payment method that works best for them, with an increasing number preferring the convenience, security and versatility of cashless payment methods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware that cashless payment methods are not suitable for everyone and there are no plans to force Australia to become a cashless society. The Government continues to monitor developments in the payment system to ensure it remains accessible for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning Petition number EN3088 requesting the banning of gain of function research.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">'Gain of function' is a term used to describe a change to the genome of any organism (such as an animal, insect, plant, virus, bacterium or fungus) through any process that causes it to acquire a new function. Gain of function research involves a broad range of fundamental experimental techniques that have been used for decades in life sciences research. Gain of function research has led to new knowledge that benefits human health—for example, new knowledge about processes underlying human and animal health and disease, and about how pathogens spread, infect and cause disease. Gain of function research has also led to the development of new pharmaceuticals and vaccines, precision medicine and gene therapies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Most gain of function research does not raise concerns. However, a small subset of gain of function experiments can raise concerns because of their potential to increase the danger posed to humans by an infectious agent, such as a virus. There are strong regulatory controls in Australia for all research, including gain of function research. These controls include ethics and biosafety approvals, which require consideration of the risks and benefits of the research. A ban of all gain of function research would also stop gain of function research that results in medical innovations and benefits to human health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have asked the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) to conduct a review of gain of function research in Australia. The Terms of Reference for this review are available on NHMRC's website at: nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/news-centre/gain-function-research-review.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Quarantine</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 to the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Karen Andrews MP, concerning petition number EN3090 calling for the end of the hotel quarantine program, construction of multiple dedicated quarantine facilities, airports only accepting freight flights and aircrew not being permitted to leave airports. I am responding as the Minister for Health and Aged Care with portfolio responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 27 March 2020, National Cabinet agreed that mandatory hotel quarantine should be implemented under state public health orders, reflecting the practicalities of an effective quarantine system, which needs to bring together healthcare, logistics and law enforcement. As such, quarantine arrangements are predominantly a matter for state and territory governments. Australia's hotel quarantine system is a critical intervention in managing the potential spread ofCOVID-19. As each jurisdiction is responsible for managing the COVID-19 response under its own public health legislation, decisions to implement lockdowns around the country are the responsibility of state and territory governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's national quarantine policy is continuing to adapt based on emerging evidence and the best available medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Managed quarantine for international arrivals to Australia, including hotel quarantine and other highly controlled settings, has been Australia's first line of defence against COVID-19 and continues to play a vital role in Australia's public health response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions regarding quarantine requirements for both vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers continue to be considered as Australia progresses through the four-step National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response (National Plan). From 1 November 2021, fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents can travel overseas without an exemption. In some jurisdictions, such as New South Wales and Victoria, there are no quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated eligible travellers returning to or entering Australia. Some jurisdictions are also trialling modified quarantine arrangements, including home quarantine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Plan will continue to provide a graduated pathway to transition Australia's COVID-19 response from its pre-vaccination settings focused on continued suppression of community transmission, to post-vaccination settings focused on prevention of serious illness and fatalities, whereby the public health management of COVID-19 is consistent with other infectious diseases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may note that the Australian Government is already funding dedicated quarantine facilities known as Centres for National Resilience in Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane, which will, alongside the highly successful Centre at Howard Springs, and the hotel quarantine system, provide quarantine accommodation for cohorts coming into Australia in line with state and territory requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safe operation of additional international passenger services as Australian vaccination rates continue to increase, remains critically important to maintaining connectivity and people to people links for Australians, as well as supporting our key tourism and education industries. International passenger services ·are also integral for the Australian economy by facilitating international two-way trade, with international passenger services also carrying a significant amount of international air freight in the belly hold of these aircraft.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Safe health practices will continue to apply to international aircrew upon their arrival and before their departure from Australia, having regard to their vaccination status. International airline and airport operators in Australia are also putting in place a range of measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 on aircraft and at airport facilities to enable the staged return of an increase in international passenger arrivals into Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 18 October 2021 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, relating to a petition about the consumption of alcohol at Parliament House (Petition no. EN3099). The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's parliamentary democracy, like many others around the world, is based on the Westminster system. In such systems, it is up to the presiding officers, in our case the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, to establish the Standing Orders that govern proceedings in each Chamber.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current Standing Orders do not contain any provisions relating to drug or alcohol use for federal politicians. In my experience in the Parliament, it has been the case that the overwhelming majority of Members and Senators conduct themselves in an appropriate way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that everyone has an opportunity to have their say about the issues that matter to them. I agree with the constituents' view that it is incumbent on all parliamentarians to conduct themselves while undertaking our official duties without the influence of drugs or alcohol. The views of the constituents on this particular issue have been carefully noted and will be taken into account.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition number EN3108, implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine passport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has not made any decisions around the use of mandatory vaccination certificates. States and territories have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health measures within their jurisdiction. As such, states and territories may require proofofCOVID-19 vaccination when considering travel exemptions for interstate travel during state-determined lockdowns and travel restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can already provide voluntary proof of vaccination by accessing their immunisation history statement through Medicare Online, via the Express Plus Medicare mobile app or via their My Health Record. People can seek a hard copy of their immunisation history statement by contacting the Australian Immunisation Register enquiries line, or through their doctor or immunisation provider.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers and businesses have started to mandate vaccinations for their employees working in a high-risk workplace, and for their patrons. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses will need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their particular workplace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to provide guidance to businesses on these matters, and to encourage vaccination uptake by communicating about the safety, science, and benefits ofCOVID-19 vaccination. Those who are unable to be vaccinated for a genuine medical condition may be granted an appropriate exemption certificate dependent on the rules in their state or territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that apart from select high-risk workplaces and professions, COVID-19 vaccination in Australia largely remains voluntary and individuals may choose to vaccinate. The Government will continue to work with the states and territories to promote a nationally consistent approach for mandating COVID-19 vaccination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been mandated for identified high-risk groups through state and territory legislation, exemptions are available for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons. It is important that everyone who can be vaccinated, does, to help keep themselves and others safe.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition number EN3115 requesting the cessation of mass vaccination against COVID-19 and the implementation of large-scale chemoprophylaxis treatment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is taking a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, informed by the latest medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and its expert standing committees, including the Public Health Laboratory Network and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective means of preventing the spread and development of diseases such as COVID-19 in the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 vaccines are helping to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation, and fatality. Sitting under the Australian Health Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus—COVID-19 (COVID-19 Plan) is the COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This strategy supports the access to, and delivery of, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and treatments as soon as they become available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 Plan, first released in February 2020, was developed to guide the Australian health sector response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 Plan provides guidance on the response actions, proportionate to the level of risk, required to minimise the health impacts of the pandemic on the Australian population. A review of the COVID-19 plan is currently underway which will incorporate updated information on the coronavirus vaccines and treatments available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, there is no cure or treatment to prevent COVID-19, although a number of medications can help people who are very seriously ill. The National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce, consisting of a large group of Australian clinical experts, is continuously updating recommendations, and considering the effectiveness of therapeutics for both the prevention and treatment ofCOVID-19 infection based on the best available evidence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration, part of my Department, is Australia's medicines regulator. For a medicine to be registered in Australia to treat a specific condition, a sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) is required to submit a comprehensive developmental dossier which consists of clinical studies, non-clinical/toxicology studies, chemistry, manufacturing, risk management and other information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any experimental medication used in the treatment of COVID-19 must be prescribed and administered either in a controlled health care setting or as part of clinical trial assessing the merits of treatments under research conditions with appropriate ethical oversight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the pandemic situation continues to evolve and new evidence emerges, the Government will continue to review its response strategies and provide Australians with the most up to date information and advice. A visit to the Government's website at: www.australia.gov.au will keep you well-informed about Australia's health response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning Petition EN3127 asking the House to have ivermectin recognised as a legally accessible treatment for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that Australians have access to, and delivery of, safe and effective vaccines and treatment options for COVID-19 as soon as they are available, through our COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have provided information below in response to the issues raised in Petition EN3127.</span>

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">New </span>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">restrictions on ivermectin</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">lvermectin is an anti-parasite medication which is used to treat a number of human and animal diseases. Oral ivermectin (Stromectol) is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), part of my Department, for the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis), threadworm of the intestines (intestinal strongyloidiasis), and scabies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 10 September 2021, a senior medical officer at the TGA, acting on the advice of the Advisory Committee for Medicines Scheduling (ACMS), placed new restrictions on the prescribing of oral ivermectin. The ACMS is an independent advisory committee consisting of medical and pharmaceutical experts from across Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">General practitioners can continue to prescribe ivermectin for the TOA-approved conditions (indications). Certain specialists including infectious disease physicians, dermatologists, gastroenterologists, and hepatologists (liver disease specialists) may also prescribe ivermectin off-label for other unapproved indications if they believe it is appropriate for the treatment of a particular patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA introduced these changes because of concerns with the off-label prescribing of oral ivermectin for the claimed prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in the context of insufficient evidence of safety and efficacy (see below). These concerns include the significant public health risks associated with taking ivermectin as an alternative to vaccination, unsafe dosages being promoted, and to ensure continued access for those who need the medicine for treatment of scabies and parasite infections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Ivermectin and COVID-19 treatments</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ivermectin is not approved for use.as a treatment for COVID-19 in Australia or in any other comparable country, and it is the consensus view of international regulators and top-tier journals that more evidence from large, prospective, and randomised controlled trials is required before it could be considered a safe and effective treatment. Although ivermectin may already be registered in Australia for other uses, it does not automatically mean that it is safe and effective when used to treat another condition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment is also strongly discouraged by eminent organisations including the National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce (an independent group of Australian clinical experts), the World Health Organization, the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the European Medicines Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 4 February 2021, Merck, one of the major manufacturers of ivermectin, publicly confirmed that, to date, there is no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies, no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and a concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, a recent analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration of published ivermectin trials concluded that ivermectin could not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment or prevention. The Cochrane Collaboration is one of the key independent international bodies responsible for assessing clinical evidence for medical treatments and therapies. The Cochrane study is titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 </span>and can be found at: www.cochranelibrary.com.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Cochrane Collaboration also found that the available evidence for ivermectin is of low to very low quality and insufficient to draw any clinically meaningful conclusions. In addition, several studies claiming to support the use of ivermectin have not yet been peer-reviewed, with one of the larger studies recently being withdrawn from preprint due to allegations of data manipulation (www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-100956/v3 and www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02081-w).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I assure you that my Department is regularly meeting with researchers, developers and manufacturers about a wide range of medicines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in a variety of clinical settings, and that the TGA welcomes and encourages discussions with prospective sponsors about the regulation process for potential COVID-19 treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While evidence is still being gathered for potential COVID-19 treatments, I must emphasise that if a sponsor holds the appropriate evidence, they can make an application to the TGA at any time to register their medicine on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. As is the case for all prescription medicines, the application must include a comprehensive data package to support the medicine's safety, quality, and efficacy, as well as a source of product manufactured to pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Practice requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This long-standing and well-established process provides rigorous safeguards to ensure that Australians have access to safe, effective and high-quality medicines. It must be noted, however, that the TGA is unable to commence assessment in the absence of an application, and neither the Government nor the TGA can compel a sponsor to make such an application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To date, the TGA has provisionally approved three COVID-19 treatments via the provisional registration pathway: Remdesivir (VEKLURY), Sotrovimab (XEVUDY) and casirivimab/imdevimab (RONAPREVE). The TGA has also granted a provisional determination to four other COVID-19 medicines for evaluation through this pathway.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Up-to-date information about COVID-19 treatments available in Australia can be found on the TGA's website at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19/covid-19-treatments.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 vaccines which have received provisional approval in Australia have each been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalisation, and death from COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2. The risk of a person infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus developing symptomatic illness and becoming seriously unwell with COVID-19 is significantly reduced if that person has received a COVID-19 vaccine. For each provisionally approved vaccine the TGA has established the acceptable safety, quality and efficacy of the vaccine based on a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More information about COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, including those under evaluation, is available on the TGA's website at: www.tga.gov.au/safety-information/covid-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am confident that the TGA continues to respond appropriately and with great priority to ensure the timely availability of new COVID-19 treatments without compromising on Australia's high standards of safety, quality and efficacy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning EN3128 requesting the disclosure of the COVID-19 vaccine ingredients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safety of the Australian population has always been the highest priority of the Australian Government. For this reason, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is working closely with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the ATAGI and all state and territory health departments to ensure that monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety is of the highest possible standard in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia. All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and/or disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is open and transparent about safety information relating to COVID-19 vaccines, including any suspected side effects or potential safety issues. The TGA publishes a weekly safety report, including information about reported suspected side effects, as well as other safety alerts as required. More information can be found at: www.tga.gov.au using the search terms 'COVID-19-vaccine safety monitoring and reporting'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although graphene oxide may serve as a potential vaccine carrier to help activate immunity, none of the COVID-19 vaccines approved and in use in Australia include graphene oxide.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), Pfizer, and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine Product Information (PI) leaflets are publicly available on the TGA website, listing the ingredients in each vaccine. The PIs are required as supporting documents for regulatory approval. None of the PI's for these vaccines list graphene oxide as an ingredient and is therefore not present.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The goal is to protect all people in Australia from the harm caused COVID-19 infection, through preventing serious illness and death, and where possible, disease transmission. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines have all been proven through approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 October 2021, all Australians aged 12 years and over are now eligible to receive a COVID 19 vaccine. Australians aged 60 years and over are now eligible to receive a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, while those aged 18 years or over can choose to have the AstraZeneca vaccine after providing informed consent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important for Australians to have access to credible and timely information about COVID-19 vaccines. It is a large and complex project, and the information you are seeking may change over time- that is why we strongly encourage all Australians stay up-to-date on all news and announcements, by regularly checking my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaccination remains the most effective way for people to protect themselves from the effects of COVID-19. The Government encourages everyone to be vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition number EN3132, requesting that the Biosecurity (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Amendment (No. 1) Determination 2021 be rescinded.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government regularly reviews determinations made under section 477 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015 </span>(Act) taking into account the latest expert medical advice to ensure their appropriateness in terms of global and local epidemiology.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The emergency requirements under section 477 of the Act, which include the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020 (Overseas Travel Ban), aim to control and prevent the entry, emergency, establishment and spread ofCOVID-19 into Australian territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The amendment determination (the subject of this petition), removed only the automatic exemption from outgoing travel restrictions that applied for Australian citizens who are usually residents in another country. This was an important change designed to reduce the burden on our quarantine and health systems by reducing frequent travel back and forth, freeing up more quarantine places for Australians who are already overseas and seeking to return home.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals with a legitimate need to travel can still request an exemption from the Australian Border Force. Australians who are in Australia, or who travel to Australia and wish to return to their usual country of residence, are still able to apply for an exemption to travel on an exceptional basis, the same requirement as applies to every other Australian.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Specific emergency management determinations are made in the context of the human biosecurity emergency period declared under section 475 of the Act, and which is due to lapse on 17 December 2021. The Government has not yet made any decision about whether the emergency period will be extended. The Government is closely monitoring the evolving degree of public health risk, taking into account factors such as the impact of the vaccination rollout.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's four-phase National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response outlines that once 80 per cent of Australians over the age of 16 years are fully vaccinated, and that target has also been reached by a jurisdiction, that jurisdiction would open to international travel for fully vaccinated Australian citizens with no requirements for exemptions.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Health Care</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning Petition EN3141 which asks to let all medical doctors prescribe ivermectin for people diagnosed with COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring Australians have access to safe and effective options for the prevention and treatment ofCOVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe and effective and as such are recommended for all Australians from 12 years of age. There are very few situations where a COVID-19 vaccine is contraindicated (e.g. the patient is allergic to an ingredient in the vaccine, has had a serious adverse event after the first dose, or has a history of certain blood clotting disorders) and these are detailed in the Product Information (for healthcare practitioners) and Consumer Medicine Information documents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a patient has a contraindication to one type ofCOVID-19 vaccine (e.g. mRNA) they may still be able to be immunised with the alternative type (e.g. viral vector). Medical exemptions are rarely required, and an individual's medical practitioner is best placed to discuss alternative options with the patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ivermectin is an anti-parasite medication that is used to treat human and animal diseases. Oral ivermectin (Stromectol) is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis), threadworm of the intestines (intestinal strongyloidiasis), and scabies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 10 September 2021, the TGA decision maker (delegate), acting on the advice of the Advisory Committee for Medicines Scheduling, placed restrictions on the prescribing of oral ivermectin through a change to its scheduling entry in the Poisons Standard. The Advisory Committee, which included senior medical officers and pharmacists as well as representatives from each state and territory, unanimously supported the change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The change is also supported by the two peak bodies representing general practitioners—the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australian Medical Association. In law, the TGA decision is independent from Commonwealth parliamentary processes and is given effect through state and territory law and regulation. It should be noted that there are a significant number of other medicines that either cannot be prescribed by general practitioners or alternatively require individual special authorisation (e.g. by the CEO of their state health department) to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">GPs can now only prescribe ivermectin for TGA-approved conditions (indications) such as scabies and certain parasitic infections. Certain specialists including infectious disease physicians, dermatologists, gastroenterologists, and hepatologists can prescribe ivermectin for other unapproved indications if they believe it is appropriate for a particular patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA introduced these changes because of concerns with the prescribing of oral ivermectin for the claimed prevention or treatment of COVID-19. These concerns include the significant public health risks to an individual, and those around them, associated with taking ivermectin in an attempt to prevent COVID-19 infection rather than getting vaccinated, the unsafe dosages being promoted, and to ensure continued access for those who need the medicine for the treatment of scabies and parasitic infections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ivermectin is not approved for the treatment ofCOVID-19 in Australia, or in any other comparable Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country. Its use by the general public for COVID-19 is strongly discouraged by the National COVID Clinical Evidence Taskforce, the World Health Organization, the United States of America's Food and Drug Administration, and the European Medicines Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Merck, one of the major companies manufacturing ivermectin, publicly confirmed on 4 February 2021, that to date, there is no scientific basis for a·potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies, no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and a concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, a recent analysis of published ivermectin trials by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that ivermectin could not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment or prevention. The Cochrane Collaboration is one of the key independent international bodies responsible for assessing clinical evidence for medical treatments and therapies. The Cochrane Collaboration also found that the available evidence for ivermectin is of low to very low quality, and insufficient to come to any clinically meaningful conclusions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a sponsor holds the appropriate evidence such as data demonstrating the safe and efficacious use of ivermectin for the treatment ofCOVID-19, they can make an application at any time to the TGA to register their medicine on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Any application must include a comprehensive data package to support the medicine's safety, quality, and efficacy for the intended end use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department has published information on how evidence is used in the approach to COVID-19 treatments to keep Australians safe. To date, the TGA has provisionally approved three COVID-19 treatments: Remdesivir (VEKLURY), Sotrovimab (XEVUDY) and casirivimab/imdevimab (RONAPREVE) and has provisionally designated four other COVID-19 medicines for evaluation through the provisional pathway. Up-to-date information about COVID-19 treatments available in Australia can be found on the TGA's website.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 on behalf of petitioners concerning the request for a Cannabis Access Scheme to subsidise medicinal cannabis (petition number: EN3145).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a priority of the Australian Government to provide all Australians access to safe, effective and affordable medicines. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is the main mechanism through which the Government subsidises the cost of medicines, including medicinal cannabis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has a policy to list all medicines on the PBS, following a recommendation to do so by the independent and expert Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2013, the Government has approved over 2,700 new or amended listings on the PBS. This represents an average of around 30 listings or amendments per month, or one each day, at an overall investment by the Government of$13.9 billion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 30 April 2021, I was delighted to announce the listing of cannabidiol (Epidyolex®) on the PBS effective from 1 May 2021, to provide Government-subsidised treatment to</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians living with a rare form of epilepsy (Dravet syndrome). This means that eligible patients who might have otherwise paid more than $24,000 per year for the treatment now pay only $41.30 per script or $6.60 if they have a concession card.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under legislation, the Government can only list a medicine on the PBS when the PBAC recommends such listing. Similarly, the Government requires the advice of the PBAC for a change to the circumstances of PBS listing to be made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is responsible for listing medicines on the PBS, pharmaceutical companies that hold the relevant clinical evidence are responsible for applying to the PBAC for PBS subsidy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, nabiximols (Sativex®) and Epidyolex® are the only medicinal cannabis products approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia's regulator of medicines and other therapeutic goods for use in Australia. Sativex® is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Epidyolex® is approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (another severe form of childhood epilepsy). All other medicinal cannabis products and indications are considered 'unapproved', meaning that the TGA has not established that the product meets the required quality, safety and efficacy standards. Medicines are not generally made available on the PBS to treat conditions for which they have not been approved by the TGA.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pharmaceutical companies are private entities that make their own decisions regarding their products and cannot be compelled by the Government to apply for TGA registration and PBS subsidy.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition number EN3169 requesting evidence of the existence of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), including evidence of the Delta variant. I note the reasoning described in the request, including the premise that COVID-19 emergency restrictions are unjustified and unlawful.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is coordinating an evidence-based response to the COVID-19 pandemic, informed by the latest medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and its expert standing committees, including the Public Health Laboratory Network and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Multiple scientific studies across the world demonstrate that highly reputable laboratory medicine experts have isolated and sequenced SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the virus exists, that it exists in variant forms, that it is different from other respiratory viruses, and that it causes a disease, known as COVID-19, that has resulted in almost 5 million deaths worldwide. Attached to this letter is an article by Australia's Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly, titled 'The proof is in the facts' published in the Daily Telegraph on 13 August 2021 to address queries of this nature.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department is a government agency and does not conduct scientific studies in a laboratory. While my Department is not the custodian of the scientific studies establishing the existence of SARS-CoV-2 and that of its variants such as Delta, this research has informed the Government's response to the pandemic. Those scientific studies can be sourced in the public domain.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, scientists at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity were the first to isolate SARS-CoV-2 outside China, winning the 2020 MJA/MDA National Prize for Excellence in Medical Research. This critical information was immediately shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European virus culture collections. These peer-reviewed, evidence-based publications provide scientific evidence for the existence of this deadly virus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For more information, you may wish to refer to the article published in The Medical Journal of Australia, which describes the first isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from a person in Australia, the sequencing of the virus and rapid sharing of the isolate 'Isolation and rapid sharing of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from the first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Australia', available at: www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.5694/mja2.50569.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More evidence for the isolation and existence of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, and the devastating impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by this virus, is widely available in the public domain.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time as part of their natural evolution. A change may or may not give the virus a biological advantage. Existing and emerging variants are constantly monitored using genomic surveillance to detect those that pose or may pose an increased risk to human health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is the preferred way to determine the variant and mutation patterns of the virus e.g. Alpha, Delta, and Kappa variants. WGS is undertaken within specialist jurisdictional public health laboratories which then upload these sequences to a national, secure platform and to publicly available international databases for analysis. This analysis identifies specific variants and mutations, monitors virus evolution, and identifies new or emerging clusters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These specialist laboratories are the custodians of the sequence information. Detailed scientific sequence files are not provided to the Department. In most states and territories an attempt is made to sequence all positive SARS-CoV-2 samples. In jurisdictions with widespread community transmission, sequencing prioritisation strategies are employed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some PCR tests have been designed to detect specific SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The performance of these tests is still being established, and they will not identify variants that they have not been designed for.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The World Health Organization (WHO) has also compiled a range of international multilingual scientific findings and information about COVID-19 in the 'WHO COVID-19 Database'. The database, which is updated regularly, is available at: www.search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to emergency measures available under the Commonwealth's <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015, </span>I note that state and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health in their respective jurisdictions, which is based on the medical advice from their respective Chief Health Officers. The specific measures imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 in each state and territory, including managing restrictions on the movement of residents within a state/territory, is the responsibility of the respective jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that this has been, and continues to be, a very difficult time for all Australians with many impacts, including but not limited to, citizens being unable to visit friends and family interstate and overseas. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world have taken unprecedented steps to contain the outbreak and respond to its impacts, including through legislation where there are appropriate public health justifications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The four-step National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response provides a graduated pathway to transition Australia's COVID-19 response to a post-vaccination setting focused on prevention of serious illness and fatalities, whereby the public health management of COVID-19 is consistent with other infectious diseases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Petitions Committee can be assured that the Government, along with the states and territories, is taking an evidence-based approach to COVID-19 and is committed to protecting the health of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3179 calling on the Australian Government to immediately release all The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) submission documents for publicly funded vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. Moreover, the safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia. All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk-management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The urgency of the global pandemic means that researchers, agencies such as the World Health Organization and governments all over the world are prioritising the development, assessment and rollout ofCOVID-19 vaccines. There is a combination of reasons why safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been able to be designed, researched and made available sooner than previously seen.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For example:</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Unprecedented levels of funding-the pandemic is a global priority and governments around the world are investing in research and manufacturing facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Technology-the evolution of technology has allowed vaccines to be developed at a faster pace than in the past. New technologies have helped scientists understand the</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">coronavirus and its make-up more easily, which has allowed them to start working on vaccine design more quickly.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Combined clinical trials-in response to the pandemic, some pharmaceutical companies have combined clinical trial phases 1 and 2.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Expedited review process by regulatory agencies-the TGA is engaging early with pharmaceutical companies about their vaccines and is accepting rolling data. This means that the TGA can accept, review and assess clinical trial data as it becomes available, rather than all at once at the end of the three clinical trial phases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA requires robust scientific data before supporting a vaccine candidate and will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is found to be safe and effective, following its complete assessment of data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is also part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Information Act 1982 </span>(Cwth) (FOI Act) provides a right to request access to documents held by Australian Government entities. The FOI Act recognises that facilitating access to documents held by Government entities increases public scrutiny of Government activities, processes and decisions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Members of the public can request access to Government held documents, including documents that contain sensitive or exempt material, under the FOI Act, which generally requires entities to provide a decision within 30 days of receipt of the request.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a combination of reasons why safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been able to be designed, researched and made available sooner than previously seen. For example:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Unprecedented levels of funding—the pandemic is a global priority and governments around the world are investing in research and manufacturing facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Technology—the evolution of technology has allowed vaccines to be developed at a faster pace than in the past. New technologies have helped scientists understand the coronavirus and its make-up more easily, which has allowed them to start working on vaccine design more quickly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Combined clinical trials—in response to the pandemic, some pharmaceutical companies have combined clinical trial phases 1 and 2.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Expedited review process by regulatory agencies—the TGA is engaging early with pharmaceutical companies about their vaccines and is accepting rolling data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that the TGA can accept, review and assess clinical trial data as it becomes available, rather than all at once at the end of the three clinical trial phases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes including clinical trials. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA requires robust scientific data before supporting a vaccine candidate and will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is found to be safe and effective, following its complete assessment of data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts globally. There are more than 400 trials for 140 vaccine candidates worldwide, including a number that are trialling the use of needle-free technology. These include nasal sprays, oral tablets, skin patches and jet injectors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with the Operation COVID Shield National COVID Vaccine Campaign Plan.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3203 No Mandatory Covid19 Vaccinations for Government Workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant challenges for people across Australia, and the Government recognises the additional complexity for those who undertake such important work to educate and support our youngest Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The position of the Government on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) provides advice on mitigating emerging health threats related to infectious diseases. The AHPPC has already made statements and recommendations on vaccination for several professions, including on those in the school environment, released 1 October 2021. This can be found at: www.health.gov.au using the search term 'Australian Health Protection Principal Committee'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In its conclusions, the AHPPC notes that vaccination of all adults around children is the most effective way to protect children from disease. This will also safeguard against the requirement to potentially close a school to regain control of an outbreak for the benefit of the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 can be a very serious illness and is especially dangerous for vulnerable people in the community. Vaccination in settings such as education, aged care and health care helps to protect workers, vulnerable Australians, and the broader community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current legal framework only allows employers to require their workers to be vaccinated where:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">it would be lawful and reasonable for an employer to give a worker a direction to be vaccinated, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there should be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some states and territories have also ensured that there are fast-tracked vaccinations for teachers and childcare workers, providing priority access to these groups, with or without a mandate, highlighting the importance of COVID-19 vaccination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 August 2021, National Cabinet agreed to a National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID response to a post-vaccination setting focused on prevention of serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality, like the public-health management of other infectious diseases. More information on the National Plan is available on the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's website at: www.pmc.gov.au using the search terms 'national plan'.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 October 2021 regarding petition number EN3205, requesting that a Bill of Rights to be included in the Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As noted in the petition, the Australian Constitution has no equivalent to the Bill of Rights found in the United States Constitution. Some express and implied protections, however, are given by the Constitution against legislative or executive action by the Commonwealth. Examples are section 51(xxxi) (acquisition of property must be 'on just terms'), section 80 (trial by jury is required in relation to some Commonwealth criminal offences), and section 116 (the Commonwealth cannot legislate for any religion).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The High Court has also recognised some implied restrictions on legislative power derived from the fundamental system of government established by the Constitution. For example, because of the separation of powers effected by the Constitution, only a court may exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, a law of the Commonwealth Parliament cannot confer judicial power on a body that is not a court.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, the High Court has recognised that there is an implied restriction on the legislative and executive power of the Commonwealth and of the States and Territories protecting freedom of communication on governmental and political matters. This implication arises from the system of representative government created by the Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's federal system of government means that each jurisdiction has anti-discrimination legislation and a body dedicated to promoting human rights and equal opportunity. Protected attributes at the federal level include age, disability, sex, race, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. The Government considers that existing mechanisms to protect and promote human rights, including the protections in place under anti- discrimination legislation at the Commonwealth, state and territory levels, are appropriate. On this basis, the Government does not propose to introduce a charter or bill of rights at the federal level.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Human Rights Commission also plays an imp01iant role in protecting and promoting human rights in Australia. The Commission is an independent statutory authority, established under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986. </span>Although the Commission falls within the Attorney-General's portfolio responsibility, it is independent from the Government. The Commission has a defined statutory role to promote Australians' rights and freedoms and conciliate human rights and discrimination complaints. The Commission also has an important role as an independent national human rights institution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Multiple scientific studies across the world demonstrate that highly reputable laboratory medicine experts have isolated and sequenced the SARS-COV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, demonstrating that the virus exists, that it exists in variant forms, that it is different from other respiratory viruses, and that it causes a disease that has resulted in almost 5 million deaths worldwide.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">THE world has been changed by the spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, since late 2019. Australia recorded its first case on January 25, 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Tragically, the virus has infected more than 200 million people and has resulted in the deaths of more than 4.3 million people worldwide.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia Covid-19 had affected 36,630 people as at August 9 and 938 people had lost their lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These are undeniable facts. To say otherwise is extremely dam- aging and undermines our efforts to respond to the pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The virus is real and its heart- breaking consequences are real. The loss of life is felt across communities, families and workplaces here in Australia and right around the world.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">From those caring for gravely ill people in intensive care units, to those conducting Covid-19 testing, tracing contacts and the thousands of Australian health care workers providing vaccinations to prevent serious illness and death.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">More than 250 were Covid-19 specific and among those were requests for ever more specific forms of 'scientific proof' of the existence of the Covid-19 virus.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware that a letter advising that the department does not hold documents relevant to one of those requests is being shared on social media and used to support conspiracy theories that the virus does not exist.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The extract of that letter, shared via social media, is aimed at misleading Australians and has been, maliciously, taken out of context.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Multiple scientific studies have isolated and sequenced the virus that causes Covid-19, demonstrating that the virus exists, that it is different from the influenza virus, and that it causes a disease that has resulted in more than four million deaths world- wide in just over 18 months.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Such studies have been published in reputable medical journals around the world. It is this research which has informed the Australian Government and every health professional in our efforts to bring an end to the pandemic.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">These peer-reviewed, evidence- based publications are where the scientific proof has been established for all to see. Despite this, the false claims that the virus does not exist and that the pandemic is a hoax per- sist, circulating on social media and putting everyone's health at risk.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Social media users face a daily deluge of false Covid-19 claims and unfortunately some people share reports and documents without checking the qualifications of those making the claims or the veracity of the claims themselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Social media platforms are taking action to deliver on their responsibility not to provide a forum for people to spread misinformation about Covid-19. The Department of Health works to correct much of the misinformation circulating and the Covid-19 vaccines—Is It True? web-page is a great resource addressing common questions and dispelling many of the myths.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I urge all Australians to do the right thing to protect themselves and others from this deadly virus.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning Petitions EN3214 and EN3196 asking the House to request that the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) assess the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that Australians have access to, and delivery of, safe and effective vaccines and treatment options for COVID-19 as soon as they are available, through our COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department, which includes the TGA, is regularly meeting with developers and manufacturers about a wide range of medicines for the prevention and treatment ofCOVID-19 in a variety of clinical settings. The TGA welcomes and encourages discussions with prospective sponsors about the regulation process for potential COVID-19 treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a sponsor holds the appropriate evidence, they can make an application to the TGA at any time to register their medicine on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As is the case for all prescription medicines, the application must include a comprehensive data package to support the medicine's safety, quality and efficacy, as well as a source of product manufactured to pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Practice requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the petition requested the TGA assess the products in the absence of a sponsor. However, it is not possible under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 </span>for a product to receive TGA approval in the absence of a sponsor. Following registration on the ARTG, the sponsor remains legally responsible for the product, including any safety, compliance and recall actions that may arise.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can confirm that in August 2021 the TGA held a technical meeting with a company regarding a potential application for an ivermectin product for COVID-19 treatment. In this case the TGA treated this meeting with the highest priority and are now awaiting an application from the company. There have not been any approaches by any sponsors requesting a pre-submission meeting on hydroxychloroquine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To date, the TGA has provisionally approved three COVID-19 treatments via the provisional registration pathway: Remdesivir (VEKLURY), Sotrovimab (XEVUDY) and casirivimab/imdevimab (RONAPREVE). The TGA has also granted a provisional determination to four other COVID-19 medicines for evaluation through this pathway.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Up-to-date information about COVID-19 treatments available in Australia can be found on the TGA's website at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19/covid-19-treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I strongly reject the assertion that the Government and the TGA has ignored the use of medicines such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Neither ivermectin nor hydroxychloroquine have received regulatory approval in Australia, or by any other comparable Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development regulator, for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. It is the consensus view of international regulators and top-tier medical journals that more evidence is required before these medicines could be considered safe and effective treatment options.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also strongly reject the petition's statement that COVID-19 vaccines being supplied in Australia were hastily approved and poorly tested. The Standing Committee on Petitions can be reassured that the TGA has comprehensively evaluated each of the provisionally registered COVID-19 vaccines, to ensure that they meet Australia's high standards of safety, quality, and efficacy. This formal regulatory approval by the TGA means they are not classified as experimental.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A large team of clinical and scientific experts at the TGA carefully review these data and seek advice from the Advisory Committee on Vaccines, an independent clinical expert committee, prior to a senior medical officer making a regulatory decision. Even though this is an expedited process, no element of the evaluation is rushed, and no data is overlooked.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is also a similar process to that undertaken by other major regulators such as the European Medicines Agency and United States Food and Drug Administration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 vaccines which have received provisional approval in Australia have each been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. The risk of a person infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus developing symptomatic illness and becoming seriously unwell with COVID-19 is significantly reduced if that person has received a COVID-19 vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has robust procedures in place to detect and investigate signals for potential safety concerns with COVID-19 vaccines. If the TGA detects a safety concern, rapid action will be taken to address the safety issue and promptly provide information to the public. The TGA also undertakes an independent quality assessment of every batch of vaccine supplied in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your representation of 11 February 2020 concerning petition EN1191 regarding the request to reform horse abattoirs.1 apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes the welfare of all animals seriously and is committed to high level animal welfare outcomes. The government provides a leadership role in the development of national animal welfare standards and guidelines through the Animal Welfare Task Group. This task group—comprising representatives of each of the state and territory governments, and the federal government—is the primary mechanism for the development and improvement of national animal welfare standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The task group is currently developing the Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines for Livestock at Processing Establishments, which includes horses, to replace the Model Code of Practice for Livestock at Slaughtering Establishments. Queensland is leading this review and is expected to finalise these standards in 2023. As part of this process Queensland will seek stakeholder feedback likely at some point next year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Responsibility for the regulation and enforcement of animal welfare rests with the state and territory governments for all aspects of animal handling that occurs within their jurisdictions during production, transportation, and slaughter. The Australian Government's role in regulating animal welfare is limited to exports. All export registered establishments, including those that process horse meat for human consumption, must comply with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Export Control Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2020</span>. Export abattoirs are bound to comply with their Approved Arrangement, including animal welfare standard operating procedures, which is verified and audited by the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment veterinarians. Where an export registered establishment fails to comply with the Act, the department has the power to suspend or revoke that establishment's Approved Arrangement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On a related matter, the independent Thoroughbred Aftercare Welfare Working Group, established by the industry's Thoroughbred Welfare Initiative and chaired by the Hon Dr Denis Napthine AO, recently released its report <span style="font-style:italic;">The Most Important Participant: A Framework for Thoroughbred Welfare</span>. The Thoroughbred Welfare Initiative was established by the national industry bodies including thoroughbred breeders, trainers, jockeys and other industry groups in February 2020 to examine the welfare of thoroughbred racehorses from retirement to end-of-life. The report contains 46 recommendations that provide a national approach to provide care to thoroughbred racehorses from birth to the end of their lives. You can find the report at thoroughbredwelfareinitiative.org.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Medical Workforce</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, concerning petition number EN1286 on the Modified Monash Model (MMM) 2019 classification of towns in Tasmania, in particular Lilydale. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister responsible for rural and regional health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Health uses the MMM classification system to better target health workforce programs by categorising metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas according to both geographical remoteness, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and town size. The MMM was developed to recognise the challenges faced by smaller communities in attracting health professionals. The current MMM classification system was updated on 1 July 2020 with the latest available Census data (2016). As the next Census will be conducted in August 2021, the MMM will be updated when this data is available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lilydale is classified as MM 2 (Regional Centre). This is because Lilydale is within 20 kilometres of Launceston, which has a population of over 50,000 people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Health established the Distribution Advisory Group (DAG) to provide independent advice regarding towns that raise concerns about their geographical classifications. The DAG consists of a number of peak bodies representing the rural health workforce, the National Rural health Commissioner and independent medical advisers chosen for their expertise in issues relating to rural health. At their first meeting on 6 December 2019, the DAG agreed that as the MMM is purely a data based geographical classification system, and discretionary changes cannot be made to the MMM classification of an area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Workforce Incentive Program (WIP) Practice Stream provides financial incentives to support general practices engage the services of nurses, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners and health workers, and eligible allied health professionals. Under the WIP Practice Stream, practices in all locations are eligible for incentive payments of up to $125,000 per annum to support the engagement of eligible health professionals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also funds a number of programs aimed at supporting practices to recruit, retain and upskill staff. As an MM 2 area, Lilydale continues to have access to a number of programs that encourage medical practitioners to practise in regional, rural and remote communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Practices in Lilydale can access the following benefits:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Rural Bulk Billing Incentives: Higher incentives are payable to medical practitioners in areas classified as regional, rural or remote (MM 2-7) who provide bulk billed services to vulnerable patient groups, such as people with concession cards and children under 16 years of age</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Workforce Incentive Program—Practice Stream: eligible practices can receive incentive payments of up to $125,000 per year</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Practice Incentive Program (PIP) payments: Under the PIP, geographic eligibility is determined by the Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas (RRMA) geographic classification system. Practices in Lilydale are classified RRMA 5 and can receive an additional 40 per cent rural loading on their PIP payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Government uses the Distribution Priority Area (DPA) system to identify and address the maldistribution of GPs in Australia. Lilydale is classified as DPA for both GPs and Bonded Medical Program participants. As such, practices can recruit doctors who are subject to location restrictions, such as International Medical Graduates and Australian bonded doctors with return of service obligations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">DPA status means medical practices in Lilydale can recruit from a larger pool of GPs and specialist doctors to improve access to medical services. The DPA classification system is updated annually, with the most recent update being on 1 July 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To further attract and retain doctors to Launceston and across northern Tasmanian communities, the Government announced a $2 million incentive fund on 15 December 2020 to help address longstanding GP shortages in northern and north-western Tasmania.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also funds Rural Workforce Agencies (RWAs), one in each state and the Northern Territory, to provide assistance to communities that experience difficulties attracting and retaining health professionals into regional, rural and remote areas. These agencies work with local practices, communities and other organisations to ensure that rural Australia is served by a skilled, well-supported health workforce. The RWA in Tasmania is HR+, and they can be contacted by telephone on (03) 6332 8600 or via their website at: www.hrplustas.com.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 30 November 2020 concerning petition number EN1984—Stop the new anti-smoking plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is not amending any regulations related to conventional cigarettes as inferred in the teams .of the petition at this time. The petition appears to refer to the announcement of an interim decision by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in regards to the scheduling of nicotine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 23 September 2020 the TGA announced an interim decision that, if made final, would clarify the scheduling of nicotine in the Commonwealth Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (Poisons Standard). If confirmed by a final decision, the proposed changes would mean that e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and nicotine fluids for vaping, could only be supplied with a doctor's prescription in specific circumstances and subject to state and territory legislation. The interim decision was open for public consultation until 12 November 2020, and a final decision is expected before the end of 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed changes would not affect the current exemption from scheduling for nicotine in tobacco prepared and packed for smoking and nicotine replacement therapies like gums, sprays and patches.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The interim decision was made in accordance with the requirements of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989</span>, informed by advice from the Advisory Committees on Medicines Scheduling and on Chemicals Scheduling. The final decision will be made after the TGA delegate has taken account of public submissions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA delegate found that restrictions on the availability of e-cigarettes are necessary to mitigate the potential uptake of smoking in young adults who would otherwise be at low risk of initiating nicotine addiction. The TGA delegate also considered that making nicotine a prescription-only medicine would require a medical practitioner to make an informed decision on whether it is in the patient's best interest to prescribe e-cigarettes as a smoking -cessation aid. This is consistent with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) guidelines on smoking cessation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to clarify the entry of nicotine in the Poisons Standard is one made by a senior medical officer in my Department in accordance with criteria, both set out in law and regulation. It is made independent of Ministers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RACGP guidelines recommend that all patients who smoke should be offered brief advice to quit smoking. In this regard GPs are well placed to support their patients to stop smoking. However the RACGP guidelines also state that nicotine-containing e-cigarettes are not first-line treatments for smoking cessation, and that the strongest evidence base for efficacy and safety is for TGA-approved smoking cessation therapies combined with behavioural support To date no e-cigarette product has been registered by the TGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At present smokers can seek support from their GP in quitting smoking and, when other cessation methods have been unsuccessful, consideration of whether a prescription for vaporiser nicotine may be appropriate. However a decision to prescribe medicines, including vaporiser nicotine, is a clinical judgement and the responsibility of the attending GP in consultation with the patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to support a range of measures and services to help people to quit smoking that are evidence based. These include national media campaigns and support services such as the My QuitBuddy mobile app and online quit smoking information. Confidential support and advice about quilling is also available through Quitline on 13 78 48. Certain smoking cessation products that have been approved by the TGA are also subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to provide financial support to help people quit smoking. These products include nicotine replacement therapies (in patch, gum and lozenge form) and other medications intended to assist those who are in the process of quitting smoking.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 17 February 2021 concerning petition number EN2029, calling on the Australian Government to introduce home quarantine for new arrivals and reconsider hotel quarantine fees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has taken a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, based on the latest and best medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Australia's strategy was based on the twin pillars of containment and capacity building. Our health emergency response measures were proportionate, scalable and tailored to the situation as it evolved. They have included closing borders and implementing quarantine periods; testing and contact tracing; physical distancing; and enhanced hygiene practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our international travel restrictions control and manage the entry of COVID-19 in Australian territory and abroad. These travel measures also help lower the number of new cases to levels that can be effectively managed by our health and quarantine system. As part of Australia's strategy to combat the outbreak, hotel quarantine was mandated by the National Cabinet on 27 March 2020 and has proven to be highly successful—limiting the spread of COVID-19 in the Australian community when compared to many nations around the world. On 5 February 2021, the National Cabinet confirmed that hotel quarantine will continue to be the model used to quarantine returning Australians.</span>

State and territory governments' actions, including any quarantine and self-isolation measures, are based on the medical advice from the respective Chief Health Officers and territories require returning Australians to pay a contribution to the cost of quarantine, and have processes in place for a fee waiver or reduction, upon application. An application for this will need to be made directly to the relevant state or territory government.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government appreciates that while early results of trials of psychedelic substances in Australia and internationally are extremely encouraging, more research is needed before these approaches can be used by psychiatrists outside of controlled clinical trials.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The CGM Initiative began in 2017, and provides fully subsidised CGM products to eligible people. Since that time, the eligibility criteria have been expanded to allow more people to benefit.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 February 2020, I announced changes to the eligibility criteria that will result in more than 20,000 additional people having free access to CGM products.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The changes allow all people with type 1 diabetes aged 21 years or older who have concessional status to access CGM products, removing the requirement for these people to be assessed as having 'high clinical need'. This change will increase the total number of people eligible for CGM products to over 58,000.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure the continued wellbeing and safety of all Australians, in line with the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, all incoming travellers are required to undertake a 14 day supervised quarantine period in a designated hotel or accommodation facility at their port of entry. Quarantine arrangements are predominately a matter for state and territory governments as each jurisdiction is responsible for managing the COVID-19 response under its public health legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support returning Australians, the Government has provided funding for the Centre for National Resilience quarantine facility, located at Howard Springs Darwin, to increase the number of Australians who can return home, as well as providing funding under an agreement with Tasmania for the provision of repatriation quarantine services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth is funding the full cost of quarantining vulnerable Australians on repatriation flights in the Northern Territory and Tasmania. It is estimated that these quarantine arrangements will cost approximately $8,000 per individual for their quarantine period. Travellers are asked to make a contribution towards the cost of their quarantine consistent with the fees applied by the relevant jurisdiction under their quarantine arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) have also made available a Hardship Program with emergency assistance for the most vulnerable Australian citizens overseas.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has followed the situation across the world with great concern since the pandemic began and is taking active measures to help ensure that all countries have access to COVID-19 vaccines and are able to provide coverage to their populations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's three COVID-19 vaccine agreements (Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, and Novavax vaccines) allow us to support other countries as these vaccine doses can be donated or on-sold (with no mark-up) to other countries or international organisations (including the COVAX Facility) should these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition details the amounts that Australia is providing to the COVAX Facility: that is $80 million to its Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) alongside an upfront payment of $123 million to enter into it as a self-financing economy. It is worth noting that Australia's contribution to the AMC puts us in the ten highest contributing countries. This will go a long way to supporting rapid, fair and equitable access to vaccines for 92 AMC-eligible lower and lower-middle countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is strongly committed to ensuring that the COVAX Facility provides a global solution to the pandemic and is actively working with Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization to ensure it succeeds. I was pleased to see the COVAX Facility commence its first delivery of COVID-19 vaccine doses on 24 February 2021 and am keenly following its progress as it makes its first distribution of doses across the world.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further enhancing Australia's support for global solidarity in the face of the pandemic, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) on 31 October 2020 announced the creation of a regional vaccine access and health security initiative that will consist of a range of support mechanisms including supplying safe and effective vaccine doses and delivering technical support to our regional partners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has allocated $523.2 million to this initiative. The funding will help ensure that the countries of the Pacific and Timor-Leste are able to achieve full immunisation coverage, and will make a significant contribution toward meeting the needs of South East Asia. My Department is working closely with DFAT and appropriate overseas authorities in the Pacific and South East Asia to ensure that this funding ensures the best possible outcomes for health and wellbeing and that the vaccines are assessed rigorously to ensure that they are safe, efficacious and of a high quality.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the need for global cooperation. No country can truly emerge from this pandemic until all countries have access to safe, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines and we are committed to helping this occur.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 15 February 2021 concerning a petition EN2122 requesting the rescheduling of medicinal cannabis from Schedule 8 to Schedule 4.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicinal cannabis products, including cannabidiol (CBD), can be legally accessed in Australia, but, as for all medicines, there are some regulatory controls around how this can occur to ensure safe and appropriate use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicines and chemicals are classified into schedules according to the risk of harm and the level of access control required to protect public health and safety. Scheduling decisions are made by a senior medical officer at the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) within my Department, acting as a Delegate of the Secretary, and are not decisions of me as Minister for Health and Aged Care or the Australian Government. Scheduling decisions are published in the Poisons Standard. The implementation of the Poisons Standard, as it affects access and supply of medicines and poisons, is given legal effect through relevant state and territory drugs, poisons and controlled substances legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The scheduling of medicinal cannabis has been frequently reviewed by the TGA and down-scheduled to facilitate access where appropriate, based on the risks to public health. CBD has been included under Schedule 4 (Prescription Only Medicine) of the Poisons Standard since 1 June 2015. In December 2020, the TGA Delegate made the decision to down-schedule low-dose CBD from Schedule 4 to Schedule 3, subject to a number of restrictions including dosage and pack size. As a result, since 1 February 2021, low-dose CBD products that have received TGA approval can be supplied over-the-counter by a pharmacist, without a prescription. There are currently no TGA approved products in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) which meet the criteria for supply by a pharmacist. Any new over-the-counter CBD products would need to be individually evaluated by the TGA for quality, safety and effectiveness prior to inclusion in the ARTG.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Schedule 4 entry for CBD in the Poisons Standard was also broadened to include use in research. Information concerning the reasons for these changes can be found at: www.tga.gov.au using the search term 'current poisons standard—cannabidoil'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Cannabis and CBD that do not meet the Schedule 4 or Schedule 3 criteria are captured by entries in Schedule 8 (Controlled Drug) or Schedule 9 (Prohibited Substance) of the Poisons Standard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Anyone wanting to make further changes to the scheduling of cannabis can make an application to the TGA to amend the Poisons Standard. There is no fee for lodging an application. The application form and information on how to lodge an application, with the required supporting evidence, can be found at: www.tga.gov.au using the search term 'amend poisons standard'. An email, letter or petition is insufficient to initiate the process to amend the Poisons Standard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information concerning the scheduling process, including when and how matters are referred to the Advisory Committees, can be found at: www.tga.gov.au/scheduling-medicines-poisons.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning mandated medical interventions including mandatory COVID-19 vaccines: Petition EN2129. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing a safe and effective vaccine to everyone living in Australia. The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with Australia's COVID-19 Vaccine National Rollout Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All decisions regarding the availability and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and related policies are being taken based on expert advice and are contingent on any vaccine meeting all requirements with regard to testing and safety. The Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) rigorously assesses vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness, before they can be legally supplied in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has now provisionally approved the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for use in Australia. Both these vaccines have met the TGA's high standards for safety, quality and effectiveness, and are now being provided for free to Australia's priority groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is actively monitoring COVID-19 vaccine development that is occurring both in Australia and around the world and is meeting with pharmaceutical companies to discuss trial progress and the application process. The TGA is also part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">After product registration, the TGA has an important role in batch release assessment and post-market surveillance to ensure the ongoing safety of the vaccine. Vaccines continue to be tested after their approval via additional clinical trials, surveillance and monitoring for side effects. Further information is available at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there are no mandatory vaccines in Australia, it's possible that in the future, vaccination against COVID-19 might become a requirement for travel to certain destinations or for people working in certain high-risk workplaces. If this becomes the case, there will be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">States and territories are able to issue public health directions requiring individuals to be vaccinated, as is the case where individuals entering aged care facilities must be vaccinated against influenza, except if vaccination is not available to the person or they have a medical contraindication. Similarly, workplace occupational health and safety is a matter for individual employers, providers and under model work health safety laws, employers are required to manage risks of viral exposure and infection, and persons at a workplace are required to comply, so far as they are reasonably able, with any reasonable instruction in that regard.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation in that it is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death. While the Government supports immunisation, it is not mandatory and individuals maintain the option to choose not to vaccinate.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where measures other than vaccination are appropriate to address work health and safety risks, or where there are medical reasons for refusing vaccination (e.g. for people whose health would be at risk from vaccination because of allergic reaction or adverse immune response), directions requiring vaccination may not be reasonable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are encouraged to rely on reputable sources of information to help them make informed choices and stay up to date.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Vaccination</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning Petition number: EN2175 the right to choose medical interventions and personal choice to get the COVID-19 vaccine. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing a safe and effective vaccine to everyone living in Australia. The Government is a strong supporter of immunisation in that it is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death. While the Government supports immunisation, it is not mandatory and individuals maintain the option to choose not to vaccinate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We understand that some people in the community may be hesitant about vaccination, especially in these unprecedented times. We are listening to the concerns of Australians and will encourage uptake by communicating about the safety, science and benefits of immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in Australia is being guided by the medical experts of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). ATAGI has developed resources for patients and providers to help with providing informed consent to get a COVID-19 vaccination, including an optional consent form. As with all other vaccines, valid consent is required before administering each dose of the COVID-19 vaccine</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 vaccines will not be mandatory in Australia, but it's important that everyone who can get it, does get it, to help keep themselves and others safe. Achieving community protection through immunisation would see people connecting with family and friends, transitioning back to their workplaces, and with time, a restart of our job market—all vital components to improving the lives of many Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All decisions regarding the availability and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and related policies are being taken based on expert advice and are contingent on any vaccine meeting all requirements with regard to testing and safety. The Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) rigorously assesses vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness, before they can be legally supplied in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has now provisionally approved the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for use in Australia. Both these vaccines have met the TGA's high standards for safety, quality and effectiveness, and are now being provided for free to Australia's priority groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there are no mandatory vaccines in Australia, it's possible that in the future, vaccination against COVID-19 might become a requirement for travel to certain destinations or for people working in certain high-risk workplaces. If this becomes the case, there will be exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are encouraged to rely on reputable sources of information to help them make informed choices and stay up-to-date.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Medicinal Marijuana</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 15 February 2021 concerning a petition EN2188 requesting that medicinal cannabis be made more accessible and affordable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicinal cannabis products, including cannabidiol (CBD), can be legally accessed in Australia. However, there are some regulatory controls to ensure safe and appropriate use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In general, medicines marketed in Australia must be entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) which is regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), part of my Department. Currently, there are two medicinal cannabis products included on the ARTG. Sativex (nabiximols) is used to treat certain patients with multiple sclerosis and Epidyolex (CBD) is used for patients with certain epileptic conditions. All other medicinal cannabis products are considered 'unapproved' medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pharmaceutical companies make their own decisions about commercial matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government cannot compel them to make submissions to the TGA for registration on the ARTG or to the PBAC for subsidy. The Government also has no control over the price charged for products supplied in the private market. A pharmaceutical company may be willing to supply it at a reduced cost through a 'compassionate access' program. Decisions to grant access to such programs are solely up to the company. Further to this, some states are subsidising the cost to some patients through access programs or clinical trials.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, unapproved medicinal cannabis products have not been assessed by the TGA with respect to safety, quality and effectiveness. Any Australian doctor (including GPs, specialists and non-specialists) can apply to the TGA, using a simple online form via the Special Access Scheme or the Authorised Prescriber pathways, to prescribe medicinal cannabis' if they feel it is appropriate for their patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">SAS decisions are almost always made within 48 hours. Further information is available on the TGA website at: www.tga.gov.au/medicinal-cannabis, by phone on 1800 020 653 or email at: medicinal.cannabisk-thealth.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth funding for medicines occurs through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The Government cannot subsidise a medicine for a particular condition unless the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) makes a recommendation in favour of subsidy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBAC only considers medicines which are registered on the ARTG for PBS listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBAC is an independent, expert advisory body comprising doctors, other health professionals and a consumer representative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Encouragingly, the cost of medicinal cannabis products appears to be falling rapidly. In September 2020, a study conducted by FreshLeaf Analytics showed product prices have continued a rapid downward trend with the minimum recommended retail price sitting at one quarter of the market price in 2017. It is hoped that the increased number of growers being licensed by the Government will also improve affordability for patients. In November 2020, for the first time, a private health insurer announced that it would provide benefits for treatments using medicinal cannabis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The circumstances under which medicines can be accessed by the Australian public are determined through a classification process known as 'scheduling'. Medicines and chemicals are classified into schedules, which are published in the Poisons Standard. Classification is based on the risk of harm and the level of access control required to protect public health and safety. Anyone can make an application to amend the current Poisons Standard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department has recently taken steps to facilitate greater access to low-dose CBD through the scheduling process. On 15 December 2020, the decision was made to down-schedule certain low-dose CBD preparations from Schedule 4 (Prescription Medicine) to Schedule 3 (Pharmacist Only Medicine).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision allows pharmacists to supply TGA-approved low-dose CBD-containing products (up to a maximum of 150 mg/day) for use in adults over-the-counter, without a prescription. Currently there are no TGA-approved products on the ARTG that meet the Schedule 3 criteria, but companies can lodge an application for registration of such a product and I understand that companies are meeting with the TGA to discuss the potential applications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Vaccination</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning how the international travel ban has impacted the mental health of Australian residents and citizens: Petition EN2199. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that this is a challenging time for all Australians and understands the wish for a resumption of international travel. The Government recognises the impact of these measures on individuals, families and businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to providing a safe and effective vaccine to everyone living in Australia. The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with Australia's COVID-19 Vaccine National Rollout Strategy that sets out the priority populations for the first vaccinations and the phases in which the vaccine doses will be made available in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is making every effort to vaccinate all Australians as quickly as possible global demand for vaccines is high. That's why the Government is prioritising certain population groups, ensuring the most vulnerable are protected first.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The priority groups were determined in line with advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). ATAGI has advised that quarantine and border workers, high-risk frontline healthcare workers, aged care and disability care residents, and residential aged care and disability care workers should be vaccinated as a priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A significant proportion of new COVID-19 cases in Australia are related to international travel. The number of new cases internationally continues to grow and the risk of cases being imported by Australians from international travel remains unacceptably high. The purpose of the outbound and inbound travel restrictions is to control and manage the entry of COVID-19 in Australian territory and abroad. While our health resources are prioritising a response to the domestic situation, we cannot risk adding an additional burden through an easing of international travel restrictions and potentially importing additional cases through returning Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Nonetheless, the Government recognises citizens and permanent residents may have exceptional circumstances or compelling reasons for needing to leave Australian territory. The exemption process overseen by the Department of Home Affairs and ensures that the travel restriction is no more restrictive or intrusive than required in the current global pandemic. Further information about applying for an exemption can be found at: covid19.homeaffairs gov.au/leaving-australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians choosing to travel overseas should also be mindful that foreign countries may have diminished capacity as a result of the pandemic, including in relation to health systems and consular assistance. Australians overseas may not be able to access health care or diplomatic support. There is also risk of Australians being caught offshore for longer than planned, increasing their exposure to, and risk of, contracting COVID-19. This is a challenging time with significant uncertainty, particularly for people wishing to travel overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government regularly reviews the emergency directions, including the international travel restrictions, to ensure their appropriateness in terms of global and local epidemiology and is committed to opening up both domestic travel within Australia and travel with other low risk countries as soon as the health advice says it is safe to do so. This will be based on an assessment of a country's current transmission status, as well as their ability to detect and manage cases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly changed the way we live. To help keep us safe, it is likely that our lives will be different for a while. When we aren't able to see our friends and family regularly, it can be harder to keep on top of how we're feeling. Being aware of how you're feeling and knowing what you can do to look after your mental wellbeing is an important part of staying healthy during this challenging time. There are also a number of online and chat support services at: www.beyondblue.com.au and at: www.headtohealth.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also encourage you to monitor my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au to stay up-to-date on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout as well as updates on international travel restrictions.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 16 March 2021 concerning Petition EN2276, to allow women to book surgical sterilisation through the public health system without a referral.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians are able to access timely and affordable, high quality health care by providing Medicare benefits for services listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and free hospital services for public patients in public hospitals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the concerns raised in the petition seeking to allow women to book surgical sterilisation through the public health care system without a referral. The responsibility for management of the public hospital system rests with the state and territory governments. As such you may wish to bring this petition to their attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Specialist services from all eligible Australians requires a referral from a GP and the Government has no plans to change these arrangements. This would apply to the range of items available within the MBS to assist with the payment for female sterilisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning petition number EN2334 to the House of Representatives, which requests that Medicare (or another public system) cover the costs of primary or essential dental care for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands the importance of good oral health and its role in supporting general health and wellbeing. The Government is aware of the barriers to accessing affordable dental services and supports a range of targeted programs for adults and children so they can access care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is assisting children to access basic dental services through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS). Eligible children aged two to 17 years can access the CDBS for up to $1013 in benefits for basic dental services over two calendar years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 10 June 2020, the Government announced $107.8 million for a one year extension to the National Partnership Agreement on Public Dental Services for Adults (NPA). The extension will provide funding to states and territories to deliver additional services to around 180,000 public dental patients. The current NPA is providing the states and territories with $458.1 million from 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2021 for additional services to around 763,000 adult public dental patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Government support is designed to provide additional services on top of those funded by states and territories. States and territories are responsible for the delivery of public dental services including funding, planning, co-payments and management of waiting lists.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also provides support to states and territories through the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA). In 2018-19 the Commonwealth provided $193.3 million through the NHRA. This included $40 million for admitted dental services, and $153.3 million for specialist outpatient dental services. More detail on Government funding for dental services is provided in the table below.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 March 2021 concerning Petition EN2369 seeking a 'reconsideration of the decision to implement a prescription-only model for access to e-cigarettes, and to allow for the easy importation of vaping liquids by nicotine addicts'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is independent of Australian Government and it is legally binding. The decision follows extensive public consultation, and it is consistent with the existing ban in all states and territories on the sale of nicotine e-cigarettes without a doctor's prescription (and the prohibition on possession in all states and territories except for South Australia). The TGA's reasons for its decision include the particular concern for the attractiveness of these products to adolescents, and the recent rapid increase in their use by adolescents and their susceptibility to nicotine dependence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Having regard to the concerns expressed in the petition about its potential effects, I note that a number of steps are being taken to support the effective implementation of the TGA's decision. In addition to working with peak bodies including The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to support the preparation of relevant clinical and practical guidelines, my Department is publishing other educative materials for health practitioners. The TGA will also publish communications for affected consumers including in social media channels, and in the form of animated videos. There are two tranches of communication activities planned for 2021—the first later this month, and the second in August about six weeks before the implementation of the TGA's decision.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 March 2021 concerning petition EN2372—request to extend eligibility criteria for the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Initiative to include all Australians with type 1 diabetes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the significant impact diabetes has on people with diabetes and their families, and is committed to working towards the broad prevention of the disease in the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CGM Initiative began in 2017, and provides fully subsidised CGM products to eligible people. Since that time, the eligibility criteria have been expanded to allow more people to benefit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 February 2020, I announced changes to the eligibility criteria that will result in more than 20,000 additional people having free access to CGM products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The changes allow all people with type 1 diabetes aged 21 years or older who have concessional status to access CGM products, removing the requirement for these people to be assessed as having 'high clinical need'. This change will increase the total number of people eligible for CGM products to over 58,000.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 March 2020, the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring system was added to the range of products subsidised under the CGM Initiative. This increases options for eligible people with diabetes in managing their condition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any decision to further expand the CGM Initiative would need to be considered against competing priorities in the Health Budget.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A review of products subsidised under the CGM Initiative has recently commenced. The review is being conducted to ensure that all CGM products are assessed on a consistent and transparent basis, and will inform future decision-making in relation to the CGM Initiative including consideration of new products. The review is expected to be completed in mid-2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides considerable additional support to people with diabetes, including those people not eligible for the CGM Initiative. The Government subsidises essential medicines, like insulin, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and diabetes-related products through the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDSS provides subsidised syringes and needles, blood glucose test strips, urine ketone test strips and insulin pump consumables to people with diabetes. It also provides educational and information services to assist in the best use of products and self-management of diabetes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not consider vaccination status to be a complete or sufficient substitute for other biosecurity measures, such as quarantine and testing requirements, which remain in place to minimise COVID-19 health risks associated with international travel.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2021 concerning a petition, numbered EN2612, requesting that the House of Representatives introduce an overseeing body to govern the issuance of halal certifications. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention and I apologise for the delay in providing this response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that this petition, presented in the House of Representatives on 24 May 2021, received 83 signatures and that these signatories are concerned that halal certification for domestic red meat sale is being issued with inadequate scrutiny.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's only role in halal certification is in the export of red meat through the Australian Government Authorised Halal Program (AGAHP), which is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment and is underpinned by Federal legislation, operating in all export registered meat establishments producing halal meat. The government is not involved in domestic halal certification, which occurs through third-party certification.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Third-party certification is a mechanism employed by business owners to promote particular product attributes to consumers, such as red meat classed as halal. Certifiers can licence their logo or trademark to businesses that meet given standards, confirming that products bearing the mark possess the marketed attributes. It is the responsibility of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate claims of misleading or deceptive third-party certification of halal food under the Australian Consumer Law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian and State and Territory Government Ministers for Consumer Affairs considered this issue in 2018 and agreed the Australian Consumer Law was capable of addressing misleading or deceptive third-party certification of food claims and that no further regulatory intervention was required.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Halal assurance processes for food are implemented by individual food production businesses and operate under commercial arrangements. The decision by a food company to obtain or display halal certification is a voluntary business decision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 August 2021 enclosing petition EN2681, with 11 signatures, concerning reducing permanent immigration levels to 70,000-80,000 migrants per year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Migration Program settings are designed to maximise economic prosperity, national wellbeing and social cohesion by focussing on attracting and selecting highly skilled, young migrants, who deliver higher workforce participation rates, and productivity growth. This results in positive flow-on effects for the living standards of all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's Migration Program also considers the long-term population impacts on state and territory planning and infrastructure. To this end, in 2019, the Government made a series of changes to address the issue of sustainable population growth across Australia, including the establishment of a Centre of Population (the Centre) within the Department of the Treasury, in recognition of the need for a single point of analysis to assess, monitor and project changes to Australia's population.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These initiatives are further supported by the publication of Australia's first Population Statement, which can be accessed online: https://population.gov.au/publications/publications-population-statement.html.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The size and composition of Australia's permanent Migration Program is set on an annual basis. In designing the annual Migration Program, the Department of Home Affairs undertakes a planning process which involves a range of consultation activities with key stakeholders, Commonwealth agencies, state and territory governments, and the public. These consultations seek to better understand the needs and concerns of stakeholders and their views help inform the size and composition of the annual Migration Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support the development of the 2021-22 Migration Program, the Department released a discussion paper titled Planning Australia's 2021-22 Migration Program in January 2021, and subsequently received and considered 193 public submissions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, formal discussions were undertaken with key stakeholders between December 2020 and January 2021, including participants in the migration advice industry, industry and community groups, academics and researchers, Government representatives, and state and territory government representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I encourage the petitioner(s) to participate in Planning Australia's 2022-23 Migration Program through the current public consultation process and call for submissions. Further details about how to make a submission are available at: https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-and-support/how-to-engage-us/consultations/australias-22-23-migration-program.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 9 August 2021 concerning Petition Number EN2774 which requests the return of the stolen Crimean Cannons to the Russian Federation via Vladivostok. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From the information provided, the Petition appears to relate to cannons captured by the British Army during the 1853-1856 Crimean War, and then brought to Australia prior to Federation by regiments of the British Army. The Petition also refers to diplomatic cables exchanged between the Australian and British Governments during the First World War, in which the Australian Government reportedly undertook to return the cannon in question. Unfortunately, the Petition identifies neither the cannons in question, nor the diplomatic cables that discuss the Australian Government's intended course of action during the First World War.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A number of cannons dating from the Crimean War are currently held on the Defence Estate as well as in state parks and gardens. However, without further information it is unclear if any of these are the cannon referred to in this petition. Should the</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petitioners be in a position to clarify that information, then the matter can be further investigated. Department of Defence's initial assessment indicates that any subsequent action will likely require wider government, including state authorities, determination regarding any Crimean War cannons in their possession.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 August 2021 to the Hon Michael Sukkar MP, Minister for Housing, regarding petition EN2793 about tiny homes. This petition was referred to me as I am responsible for building policy matters. I note the petition and acknowledge the increasing popularity of tiny homes to provide innovative and affordable housing solutions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is delivering a range of measures to boost the supply of housing and create the right incentives to improve housing outcomes for all Australians, especially those most in need. Measures include $1 billion in funding for the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to fund critical infrastructure to unlock new housing supply, particularly affordable housing, and helping eligible home buyers to purchase their first home sooner through the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While these measures from the Australian Government are helping make housing more affordable for Australians, specific regulatory responsibility for building matters rests directly with state and territory governments. This includes regulatory responsibilities for tiny homes, given that the planning and land use regimes of state, territory and local governments play a role in determining what buildings can be built and the nature of their use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth facilitates state and territory cooperation on building matters through the Building Ministers' Meeting (BMM), which I chair. The BMM supports greater national consistency in building standards by co-funding the Australian Building Codes Board which maintains the National Construction Code implemented by all states and territories.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 23 August 2021 concerning Petition EN2829—the use of epidemiological literature in the determination of the Statements of Principles (SOPs) by the Repatriation Medical Authority (RMA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The SOP system was created in 1994 to overcome non-experts such as tribunals making uninformed judgements about complex medical-scientific evidence. The SOPs contain factors setting out the causal links between the circumstances of service and a medical condition, be it a disease or injury. These factors are drawn in reliance on the totality of the sound medical scientific evidence (SMSE) concerning the causes of the particular condition. The significant benefit is that claimant veterans or members merely have to establish the facts of service consistent with any cause outlined in the SOP factors in order to succeed with their claim.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 5AB of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans Entitlements Act 1986</span> limits SMSE to medical science that has been published in peer review medical or scientific publications or is in accordance with generally accepted medical practice, and in respect of the causes of a particular medical condition, to information that, 'meets the applicable criteria for assessing causation currently applied in the field of epidemiology'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means the RMA currently has regard to standard epidemiological criteria to assess causation. A good example is the criteria under the Bradford Hill formulation which are used in assessing the relationship between an exposure and the development of a condition. They include matters such as the strength of an association, its biological plausibility and the dose-response relationship. All these criteria involve inherent qualitative judgements and always require consideration of whether any suggested relationship is the result of chance, bias or confounding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RMA considers these matters relying on studies in peer reviewed journals. Those studies range from systematic reviews of previous research and studies involving a cohort of subjects over a long period down to individual case reports. The RMA considers and evaluates the effect of the entirety of these studies in determining the factors included in the SOPs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The use of epidemiology to create binding criteria for medical causation in a compensation system was a novel concept in 1994 and the inaugural Chairperson of the RMA, Professor Ken Donald, opined about this matter in a 1998 forum. However, he concluded that:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 23 August 2021 regarding petition number EN2835. The petition suggests the power of the Repatriation Medical Authority (the Authority) to determine Statements of Principles (SOPs) is unfairly weighted against those with entitlements under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Entitlements Act 1986</span> (VEA) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004</span> (MRCA), and that the Authority should be required to issue a statement of reasons for each SOP which it determines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">1 disagree there is an unfair weighting as suggested, and neither do I believe extending the requirement to publish reasons would add to the Authority's decision making processes. 1 have confidence the Authority's processes when determining SOPs are transparent and open to scrutiny. I take this view on the basis of the considerations which follow.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Authority is open and transparent about the evidence on which it relies when determining SOPs. I am advised whenever the Authority determines a SOP, it publishes an updated reference list on its website for the relevant condition. Each reference list sets out the sound medical-scientific evidence which the Authority has considered in determining the SOPs for that condition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Moreover, I am advised under section 1961 of the VEA, a person eligible to claim a Disability Pension under either the VEA or the MRCA, or an organisation which represents veterans and their families, is entitled to reasonable access to any document containing information considered by the Authority for the purposes of an investigation. This access is provided free of charge. When the proactive publication of reference lists and the legal right to access information are considered together, it is apparent the veteran community is readily able to obtain and scrutinise the material and evidence upon which the Authority relies in determining SOPs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised before making its decisions, the Authority actively seeks input from the veteran community, as well as those with expertise in various fields of medical science. There are various ways in which the Authority invites contributions from stakeholders. The Authority maintains an up-to-date website (www.rma.gov.au) with information about its activities, investigations and decisions, as well as a subscriber service and 'contact us' facility on the website, through which feedback and comments can be provided. It is recommended that any person wishing to be informed about the Authority's investigations or decisions, register for the subscriber service through the website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For those who do not wish to register for the subscriber service, the 'What's New' page of the website is updated with details of the decisions made at the most recent meeting of the Authority, including new investigations which the Authority will undertake. Updates from previous meetings are also available on this page.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the extensive information available on the Authority's website, a notice of investigation is advertised in the Government Notices Gazette available at www.legislation.gov.au for each new investigation the Authority commences. Each notice of investigation invites submissions from members of the veteran community or people who have expertise in a field relevant to the investigation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When commencing and finalising investigations, I am advised the Authority formally writes to each of the major national ex-service organisations (ES0s), as well as the Repatriation Commission, Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, Veterans' Review Board, Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Specialist Medical Review Council. Further, whenever the Authority proposes to repeal and not reissue a particular SOP, or to remove one or more factors from a SOP, the Authority formally consults with the same group of ES0s, the Repatriation Commission and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. The purpose of this consultation is to provide these organisations with an opportunity to be heard in relation to the repeal of the SOPs, or the removal of factors, as the case may be.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In making its decisions, Authority upholds the principles of natural justice. Natural justice requires an opportunity for a fair and unbiased hearing be given to a person before a decision is made which affects that person. As noted above, members of the veteran community and experts in fields relevant to the Authority's investigations are invited to provide submissions for consideration during an investigation. I am advised these submissions are taken into account in a fair and unbiased way_</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">SOPs are legislative instruments which must be tabled, along with explanatory statements, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The instruments are subject to disallowance under section 42 of the Legislation Act 2003, and in this way, the Authority's determinations are subjected to parliamentary scrutiny.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In closing, I draw to your attention there are a number of situations in which the Authority is currently required to provide a written statement of reasons. In particular, the Authority must give reasons when it decides:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> not to determine a SOP (subsection 1968(6), VEA);</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> not to determine a SOP for a condition which it has previously investigated or amend an existing SOP (subsection 196B(9), VEA);</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> not to carry out an investigation for a condition which it has investigated within the preceding 12 months (subsection 196C(4), VEA); or</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> not to carry out an investigation for lack of grounds or lack of sufficient relevant information (section 196CA, VEA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It may be seen the obligation to give reasons only arises when the Authority declines to exercise its powers. This is entirely appropriate. By contrast, when the Authority exercises its powers, the result is a legislative instrument which facilitates veterans access to entitlements for service-related conditions. In light of the transparent way in which the Authority exercises its powers when determining SOPs, it is not apparent there would be any additional benefit in extending the obligation to give reasons, as suggested by the petitioners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns of the petitioners to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN2854 to eliminate all taxes and stamp duties for modular, prefabricated, fold-out engineered homes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The majority of property taxation is state-based taxation including stamp duties and land taxes. State taxes are a matter for the state and territory governments. The Australian Government does not have the authority to change these taxes or to direct the state and territory governments to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Goods and Services Tax (GST) may apply to modular, prefabricated, fold-out engineered homes. The GST applies broadly to goods and services with a limited number of exemptions in areas such as food and education. Every additional exemption adds to the complexity of the GST system and increases the compliance costs of taxpayers, which are passed on to consumers. Additional exemptions would create new anomalies and lead to calls for further exemptions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The GST is levied by the Australian Government on behalf of the states and territories. The revenue from the GST goes to the states and territories and provides a secure source of funding to assist them in providing essential services, such as health and education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations and Commonwealth legislation, a change to the rate or base of the GST would need to be supported by all of the states and territories. It may also require the passage of relevant legislation by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 23 August 2021 enclosing Petition EN2856 with 8240 signatures, seeking prioritisation of family members of those living in Australia for travel to Australia as part of the National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's current travel restriction policy has played a key foundational role underpinning management of COVID-19's impact on public health in Australia and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As announced by the Australian Government on 22 October 2021, parents of adult Australian citizens and permanent residents will be considered immediate family for travel exemption purpose. Parental relationships for the purpose of a travel exemption to travel to Australia include biological, adoptive, legal, step-parent, and parents-in-law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Applications for a travel exemption to have the relationship confirmed can be submitted through the Department of Home Affairs' Travel Exemption Portal. Further information about travel exemptions for parents is available on the Department's website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/immediate-family-australian-citizens-or-permanent-residents-or-new-zealand-citizens-usually-resident-australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, before travelling, parents must also have a valid passport, a valid visa for travel to Australia and be fully vaccinated with a recognised vaccine. These requirements will be checked by the airline before boarding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response, as Australia progresses through the key vaccination thresholds, the Government is finalising plans so Australian families can be reunited, temporary visa holders including family members of those in Australia can return, and we can work towards welcoming tourists back to our shores.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that since the travel restrictions were introduced in March 2020, many people with immediate and extended families overseas have missed significant life events and therefore would like to extend my thanks to these families for their patience and their sacrifice over this period.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 enclosing Petition EN2921, with 19 signatures, concerning the situation in South Africa. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long tradition of resettling refugees and people in humanitarian need from around the world and is one of the world's most generous contributors to international refugee resettlement efforts, successfully settling more than 920,000 refugees and others in humanitarian need since the end of the Second World War.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program is designed primarily to assist people who have left their home country because of persecution or severe human rights abuses, and who have no options for return or for resettlement in another country. In limited circumstances, resettlement places may also be available for people subject to persecution who have remained in their home country. Any person who believes they meet the requirements for a humanitarian visa and wishes to seek Australia's assistance can make an application. Each application is considered on its individual merit using current and comprehensive information on circumstances in the relevant country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While most applicants have suffered some form of discrimination or persecution, the limited number of visas available and the high demand for these places means that priority is given to those people outside their home country, assessed as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and formally referred to Australia for resettlement, and applicants proposed by a close family member in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the Humanitarian Program, the Australian Government operates a Migration Program for people who wish to migrate on the basis of their skills or family relationships in Australia. The Migration Program seeks to facilitate the reunification of family members of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens (Australian sponsors). Some categories of visas, including Family visas, require sponsorship from eligible Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens. For further information on temporary or permanent migration to Australia, please refer to the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/bringing-someone/bringing-partner-or-family.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN2934—requesting to fund research into Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW) in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of health and medical research. Through the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF), the Government is improving the health and wellbeing of Australians by providing a long-term, sustainable source of funding for research that aims to improve health outcomes, quality of life and health system sustainability. Research into TSW may align with several existing MRFF grant opportunities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the MRFF 2020 Quality, Safety and Effectiveness of Medicine Use and Medicine Intervention by Pharmacists Grant Opportunity, the Government is investing $11.7 million in medical research for pharmacists to support patients with the safe use of medicines. This support recognises that all Australians will take some form of medication during their lives, but using medicines are not without risk. Research funded will tackle some of the common prescription drug issues and improve the use of medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the MRFF, $614 million has been committed to the Clinical Trials Activity initiative. A significant proportion of this funding is allocated to research on rare cancers, rare diseases and unmet medical needs, of which TSW could be considered. Information on MRFF grant opportunities is available at: www.health.gov.au/mrff, including a list of MRFF funded research projects.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Outside of research, several topical corticosteroid formulations are currently subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) as Restricted and Authority Required benefits. The current PBS listings restrict the use of topical corticosteroids to the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses and moderate to severe scalp psoriasis under certain conditions. Where increased quantities of these formulations are required, the PBS listings limit the maximum quantity that may be supplied based on the proportion of body surface area affected by the condition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBS listing of topical corticosteroids reflects the evidence that has been considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) to date. The PBAC is an independent expert body which advises the Government about PBS matters. The Government cannot list a medicine on the PBS unless PBAC makes a recommendation in favour of listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medication safety is a core component of the Quality Use of Medicines objective of Australia's National Medicines Policy. To help support the quality use of medicines in Australia, the Government provides funding to NPS MedicineWise to provide education and support for health professionals and consumers to promote the safe and effective use of medicines in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) assesses and approves therapeutic goods for use in Australia. The TGA applies a risk-based approach to ensure medicines supplied in Australia meet high standards of quality, safety, and efficacy, and that the benefits to consumers outweigh any risks associated with the use of medicines. The TGA considers the benefit-risk balance for the intended population of the medicine. At the population level, when used appropriately, evidence supports the overall benefits of topical corticosteroids in treating inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic eczema. However, all medicines have risks. Decisions around the benefit-risk balance of using a particular medicine for an individual person should be informed by the advice of a health professional and take into account the known benefits and risks of the medicine and additional factors relevant to the individual's circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To assist prescribers, information about the known risks and benefits of prescription medicines is presented in the Product Information (PI) document. For prescription corticosteroids such as prednisolone, extensive warnings and precautions are included that specifically target adrenocortical insufficiency and the risks of withdrawal. Guidelines on the duration of treatment are also included in the PI which can be found on the TGA website at: www.tga.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Information for consumers about appropriate use and safety of medicines can be found in the Consumer Medicines Information (CMI) document. This document is available for all prescription medicines and some over the counter products. Consumers can request a copy from doctors, pharmacists or via the TGA website. The CMI includes information about how to use the product and when to seek advice. Topical corticosteroids are available in Australia both with and without prescription. Non-prescription topical corticosteroids are of lower potency (strength) than prescription corticosteroids. Labels for non-prescription topical corticosteroids must include warning statements about maximum duration of use of the medicines (usually seven days). These advisory statements are set out in the TGA document Required Advisory Statements for Medicine Labels. There are guidelines to assist pharmacists to make appropriate decisions about the best product to recommend for an individual patient. Pharmacists have a duty of care to ensure that the product choice is appropriate, and that counselling about correct use, potential side effects, and when to seek medical attention is communicated at the time of purchase.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Noting the pain aspect of TSW, the National Strategic Action Plan for Pain Management presents a whole-of-care approach, with a focus on self-management, to reduce the burden of chronic pain on the individual and the community, and increase quality of life for people living with this condition. Some of the key priorities are around greater awareness of pain and pain management, more timely access to consumer-centred interdisciplinary services and research to underpin greater knowledge of pain.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I hope the above information provides some comfort to patients who have suffered because of TSW and knowledge Of work underway that may address the issues raised in the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 enclosing Petition EN2946, with 5 signatures, which requests that the House of Representatives abolish the National Firearms Agreement (NFA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's firearms laws are designed to strike an appropriate balance between community safety and providing access to firearms for those with a genuine need. The Commonwealth, states and territories are committed to the NFA which sets out a national approach to firearms regulation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2017, following a recommendation of the Joint Commonwealth-New South Wales Martin Place Siege Review, the NFA was reviewed and updated. In addition to incorporating advice from all Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement and justice agencies, the review involved extensive consultation with the firearms community (industry and recreational groups), community safety organisations and individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NFA remains a critical part of the effective regulation of firearms in Australia. While Australia has some of the strongest firearm controls in the world, illicit firearms continue to remain a threat to community safety.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Australia's federal system of government, the Commonwealth, states and territories have different areas of responsibility. Euthanasia/assisted dying is generally a matter for state governments. Currently, voluntary assisted dying is available in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia through state laws. Tasmania's <span style="font-style:italic;">End of Life Choices (Voluntary Assisted Dying) Act 2021</span> passed on 22 April 2021 and is expected to be implemented from 2022.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your Petition (EN2971), dated 19 October 2021, concerning the Cashless Debit Card (CDC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In September 2017, the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region was announced as the fourth CDC site. The selection of the participant group in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region occurred following significant consultation with the impacted communities in the area. Two Community Reference Groups (the Groups) of experts from a broad range of backgrounds were formed in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region. On 1, 2, 7 and 8 November 2018, the department held 4 community information sessions in Bundaberg, Childers, Hervey Bay and Howard. The sessions provided a platform for individuals and service providers to ask questions and receive information about the CDC program prior to its implementation in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region in early 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A person is only placed on the CDC if their permanent address registered with Services Australia is in the Bundaberg or Hervey Bay region, which is defined by the boundaries of the Federal Division of Hinkler. Once a person is participating in the program, they will remain on it so long as they continue to meet the payment and age criteria. People aged 35 years and under who receive JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment Single or Parenting Payment Partnered will receive the card. By focusing on welfare recipients 35 and under, the program can address key social problems identified during consultation, including high youth unemployment and intergenerational welfare dependence. In the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region, 90 per cent of people 25 and under on JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance residing in this region as at 30 June 2016, had a parent or guardian who received income support at some point in the last 15 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the CDC, a percentage of a participant's welfare payment is placed on a card that can be used at most shops that accept Visa, including online and overseas. The card looks and operates like a regular bankcard. It is a useful budgeting tool and only restricts the purchase of alcohol, gambling products, cash-like gift cards and cash withdrawal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Airspace Act 2007</span>, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is responsible for the administration and regulation of Australian airspace, including the amendment of airspace and air routes. Airspace changes required to implement the new flight paths at Brisbane Airport were approved by CASA on 31 October 2018 and 26 August 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 July 2021, Airservices commenced a Post-Implementation Review (PIR) of the flight path and airspace changes required for Brisbane Airport's New Parallel Runway. The PIR is reviewing the outcomes of the flight path changes for the community, environment and industry, and provides an opportunity to identify possible improvements to minimise noise impacts on the community as a whole, where safe and feasible to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Australian Government announced the Brisbane Airport Post Implementation Review Advisory Forum (the Forum) on 24 September 2021 in recognition of the significant community interest in aircraft operations around Brisbane Airport. The Forum is an independent, community-oriented body that complements existing engagement mechanisms. The Forum has been established specifically to provide advice and feedback to Airservices on matters relating to its PIR of Brisbane Airport's new runway operations. The Chair will also provide me with a quarterly report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the PIR, Airservices will consider community suggestions for improvement of Brisbane's airspace arrangements, as well as look for improvements to noise outcomes based on a review of operations since the opening of the runway. Proposed changes to airspace architecture must be approved by CASA via an airspace change proposal. Further information on the airspace change process can be found at www.casa.gov.auJairspace/airspace-regulation/airspace-change-process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Construction of a new runway and design of new airspace arrangements are inherently complex projects that take many years to develop, during which time aviation technology continues to improve. The approval of the major development plan for the New Parallel Runway at Brisbane Airport in 2007 by the then Minister for Transport and Regional Services under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Airports Act 1996</span> related only to the construction of the runway. Operational aspects, including airspace operations, required separate approval from CASA once these aspects were finalised. Enhanced aviation navigation technology has been developed since the approval, endorsed by the International Civil Aviation Organization and included in the design as international best practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2007 Environmental Impact Statement for the New Parallel Runway, which included the implementation of a plan for aviation airspace management, was approved by the then Minister for the Environment under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conse</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rvation Act 1999</span> (EPBC Act). The EPBC Act is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment and the Minister for the Environment. As the New Parallel Runway project is completed, Airservices cannot be directed to complete a new Environmental Impact Statement, however this does not mean that the issues being raised are unable to be addressed by alternative mechanisms, which I understand are being considered through the Airservices' PIR.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring this petition to me and I trust this information is of assistance. I have copied this letter to the Hon Sussan Ley MP, Minister for the Environment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 October 2021, concerning Petition EN2989 requesting the provision of reliable and consistent internet service for Moore Creek, Daruka and Moonbi Gap in New South Wales.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can well understand the frustration from residents of these regional areas with their online experience through ADSL technology. It's important to understand that the supply and repair of ADSL services are commercial decisions by internet providers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2018 the Government announced its approach to its new Universal Service Guarantee (USG) for telecommunications. The USG provides people across Australia with reasonable access to broadband as well as voice services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the USG, NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) is the default wholesale provider of broadband services. NBN Co's role is underpinned by new statutory infrastructure provider (SIP) legislation, which took effect from 1 July 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the SIP legislation, NBN Co is the default SIP for Australia, but other carriers must be the SIPs for developments they are contracted to serve. SIPs are required to connect premises to high-speed networks in their areas of responsibility, and supply wholesale services that allow retail providers to supply high-speed broadband to end-users with peak download and upload speeds of at least 25/5 megabits per second (Mbps). SIPs must deploy fixed-line networks unless it is not reasonable to do so, in which case they must deploy either fixed wireless or satellite networks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to work with consumers and industry to see if there are better ways to deliver USG services over the long term.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co has completed the construction of the National Broadband Network (NBN) using a range of technologies. This has included the use of fixed wireless and satellite to provide services in locations that are technically and financially challenging to serve due to low population densities and the topography of the area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co's website indicates that NBN fixed wireless or satellite services are available in Moore Creek and Daruka areas, and NBN satellite services are available in the Moonbi Gap area. To connect to an NBN service, residents need to contact an internet retailer and choose a plan that suits their needs. Further information about the NBN, including a list of providers for the area, is available at www.nbnco.com.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co's satellite broadband service has been designed to bring a step-change in the experience of broadband users in regional and remote Australia, offering peak wholesale download speeds of 25 Mbps and upload speeds of 5 Mbps, which is much faster than ADSL connections on average.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The company has continued to invest in new products and technologies to better meet the connectivity needs of communities served by NBN Co's satellites. This includes:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Sky Muster Plus (launched August 2019) which provides satellite users with access to unmetered data for all online content and applications, with the exception of video streaming and VPN (Virtual Private Network) traffic, which continue to be metered. Approximately 70 per cent of all data use is unmetered and does not contribute to a household's monthly data allowance.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co currently invests around $200 million annually to optimise the performance of its fixed wireless network. As a result, fixed wireless customers on a 50 Mbps plan are experiencing average download speeds of approximately 35 Mbps during the busy hour period (between 7pm and 1 lpm) and approximately 43 Mbps across all hours. NBN Co is continuing to investigate options to enhance the fixed wireless network over time such as through the use of 5G technology and mmWave spectrum.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, in the fixed wireless and satellite footprints, existing copper lines will not be disconnected and consumers will still have the option to use their existing landline telephone. ADSL services may also be available where broadband retailers choose to offer them.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Constitution does not grant the Commonwealth the power to make laws for matters relating to health, including laws that criminalise breaches of public health orders. Rather, states and territories have reserve jurisdiction to make laws on the subject of health. Therefore, the Commonwealth is not authorised to create a new Federal offence for these matters, as this would violate the division of powers articulated in the Constitution, and encroach upon the powers granted to states and territories.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a matter for the relevant law enforcement agencies to investigate the commission of any offences within their relevant jurisdictions and obtain evidence for prosecution purposes. If you continue to have concerns about alleged offences that relate to unlawful protests, state and territory police are the appropriate authorities to investigate and prosecute such matters.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The role of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (AS 10) is to identify and investigate threats to security, and provide advice to Government to protect Australia, including its people and interests. ASIO's functions do not include law enforcement activities and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth)</span>, explicitly protects the right of persons to engage in lawful advocacy, protest or dissent.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 October 2021 regarding Petition number EN3043. In response to the issues raised in the Petition, I can provide the following advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) is a Statutory Authority and corporate Commonwealth entity established under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Act 2008</span> (ACARA Act). The ACARA Act states that ACARA must perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with the ACARA Charter, including the development of a national curriculum, which is agreed by Education Ministers. The ACARA Act also sets out the requirements for establishing the Board.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While ACARA's work is set by Education Ministers, its Board has the authority to decide the activities necessary to carry out this work. Advice on key activities is provided through an advisory structure that incorporates government and non-government school sector representation and expertise in specific related fields.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander Advisory Group (ATSIAG) was established in 2009 and provides ACARA with expert guidance and advice about the representation of Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander histories and cultures in the Australian Curriculum.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the governance of all advisory groups, issues relating to ATSIAG's composition is a matter for ACARA's Board.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 18 October 2021 concerning Petition EN3053, with 514 signatures, which requests permanent residency pathways for New Zealand minors on a Special Category Visa.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government values the unique bilateral relationship between Australia and New Zealand. Under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australian and New Zealand citizens, who present no health or character concerns, can visit, live and work in either country indefinitely and without restrictions—a benefit Australia has not conferred on any other nation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of our special bilateral relationship, the Government also created an additional pathway to permanent residence for New Zealand citizens who are long-term residents in Australia. Access to this pathway is contingent upon demonstrating a contribution to Australia through income tax returns which show taxable income at least equivalent to the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold. The Government has agreed to review the pathway to permanent residence for New Zealand citizen temporary visa holders in 2022, to determine whether any further improvements to the stream should be made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Like all nationalities, New Zealand citizens seeking an option to apply for a permanent visa can also explore the range of visa options available under the Family and Skill streams of the Australia's annual Migration Program.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 19 October 2021 concerning a petition (EN3058) presented to the House of Representatives on 18 October 2021 on Age Pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government appreciates the important economic and social contribution senior Australians make to our community and is keen to ensure pensioners' living standards are safeguarded by the Age Pension. Pensions such as the Age Pension are funded by taxpayers and targeted through the means test to those who need them most.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pensions are paid at the highest legislated rate of income support in the social security system because recipients are not expected to work to support themselves. Under social security law, base pension rates are indexed twice a year to ensure they keep up with increases in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index. These rates are calculated according to provisions in legislation and are not a decision of government. Base pension rates are also benchmarked to Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE) to align them with community living standards. Base pension rates are currently above the MTAWE benchmark.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 September 2021, the maximum total pension rate for single pensioners increased by $14.80 to $967.50 a fortnight, or $25,155 a year. The maximum rate for pensioner couples combined increased by $22.40 to $1,458.60 a fortnight, or $37,923.60 a year. Pension rates will continue to be reviewed twice a year, as set out in legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to their main payment, pensioners can also receive a range of benefits and concessions that increase their economic security, including subsidised prescription medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, subsidised health care and related products, and subsidised aged care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the Government's economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, each eligible pensioner also received a total of $2,000 through four Economic Support Payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA) is available to assist eligible individuals or households receiving income support, family assistance payments or veterans' service pensions with the costs of private rent. The Government expects to spend around $5.3 billion on CRA in 2021-22, to assist around 1.5 million eligible individuals and families with the cost of their rent. CRA is adjusted each year in March and September, in line with CPI.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Wage earners, including those receiving the minimum wage, pay income tax on their earnings. In the personal income tax system, senior Australians receive tax relief through the seniors and pensioners tax offset (SAPTO). The SAPTO is available to taxpayers in receipt of a taxable government pension, as well as to Australians who are of Age Pension qualifying age and who meet the Age Pension eligibility criteria (age and residency) but do not receive a pension due to the income or asset tests. In 2021-22, eligible single senior Australians with incomes up to $33,898 (or $30,592 for each member of a couple) pay no income tax. Currently, senior single Australians with incomes up to $36,705 also pay no Medicare levy. By way of comparison, most people below Age Pension age start to pay income tax and the Medicare levy once their annual taxable income exceeds $23,226.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition number EN3078.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant challenges for people across Australia, and the Australian Government recognises the additional complexity for those who undertake the important work in the hospitality sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's highest priority has always been the health and safety of the community. As the Government continues to expand and accelerate the vaccine rollout, it is taking the issue of vaccinations for all Australians very seriously. To this end, Australia's rollout has taken another step forward, with all Australians aged 12 years and over, including those working in the hospitality sector, now eligible for COVID-19 vaccination with either the Pfizer, Moderna or Astra Zeneca vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can therefore book in for their vaccination now through participating general practices, pharmacies, and state vaccination hubs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is a strong supporter of immunisation and has always stated that receiving a COVID-19 vaccination would be voluntary. Immunisation is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Operation COVID Shield aims to get as many Australians who want to be vaccinated a vaccine by the end of this year. More than 36 million vaccine doses have been administered across the country, with more than 85 per cent of the eligible population aged 16 years and over protected with two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We encourage all eligible Australians to come forward and receive a vaccine. Our advice is that you do not wait—vaccination protects you, your loved ones and the greater community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As announced by the Australian Government on 22 October 2021, parents of adult Australian citizens and permanent residents will be considered immediate family for travel exemption purpose. Parental relationships for the purpose of a travel exemption to travel to Australia include biological, adoptive, legal, step-parent, and parents-in-law.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your email of 18 October to the Minister for Sport, Senator the Hon Richard Colbeck, regarding Petition EN3122—Granting Taxpayer Funds to Exhibit Niche Sports Content. Your email has been forwarded to me for reply as I have portfolio responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners are concerned about the tender process for the Under-represented sports grant to Foxtel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2017-18 Budget the Australian Government provided $30 million over four years for Foxtel to increase television and online coverage of women's, niche, and emerging sports. This formed part of the comprehensive package of reforms put in place by the Coalition Government in 2017 to support Australia's broadcast and content sector. Foxtel was well placed to administer this grant as a leading sports broadcaster.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 22 July 2020, the Government announced a further $10 million in funding to continue support for coverage of women's, niche and other under-represented sports, bringing total funding for the under-represented sports grant to $40 million over six years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The additional funding was provided to enable prioritisation of broadcasting of under-represented sports as sports resumed play following COVID-19-related shut-downs. This funding formed part of the Government's COVID-19 Response Package.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting sport in Australia from grassroots to elite; increasing participation in physical and recreational activities to promote physical and mental health, staging world class major sporting events and protecting the integrity of sport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This grant funding supports the profile of under-represented sports in Australia, providing them the foundation to boost engagement, participation and commercial opportunities. The grant is supporting increased coverage for sports including: Australian Women's cricket, AFLW, Wheelchair Rugby, Women's Basketball, lawn bowls, Women's surfing, softball and Women's Baseball. In 2020-21, Foxtel broadcast more than 4,700 hours of content under the funding agreement (including 1,400 live hours) across 25 different sporting competitions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Under-represented sports grant opportunity concludes on 30 June 2022. My Department will commence an evaluation of the program following its conclusion. I also note that a request to examine this grant activity has been presented to the Auditor General—and that as a result, this grant is within scope for an Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) audit.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 enclosing Petition EN3129, with 52 signatures. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long tradition of resettling refugees and people in humanitarian need from around the world and is one of the world's most generous contributors to international refugee resettlement efforts, successfully settling more than 920,000 refugees and others in humanitarian need since the end of the Second World War.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program is designed primarily to assist people who have left their home country because of persecution or severe human rights abuses, and who have no options for return or for resettlement in another country. In limited circumstances, resettlement places may also be available for people subject to persecution who have remained in their home country. Any person who believes they meet the requirements for a humanitarian visa and wishes to seek Australia's assistance can make an application. Each application is considered on its individual merit using current and comprehensive information on circumstances in the relevant country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While most applicants have suffered some form of discrimination or persecution, the limited number of visas available and the high demand for these places means that priority is given to those people outside their home country, assessed as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and formally referred to Australia for resettlement, and applicants proposed by a close family member in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the Humanitarian Program, the Australian Government operates a Migration Program for people who wish to migrate on the basis of their skills or family relationships in Australia. The Migration Program seeks to facilitate the reunification of family members of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens (Australian sponsors). Some categories of visas, including Family visas, require sponsorship from eligible Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens. For further information on temporary or permanent migration to Australia, please refer to the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/bringing-someone/bringing-partner-or-family.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (the Refugee Convention), I can assure you that Australia takes its international obligations seriously and provides protection to refugees consistent with the obligations set out in the Refugee Convention, and other relevant international treaties to which Australia is a party. Unlawful non-citizens are only removed if the Department of Home Affairs is satisfied they do not engage Australia's non-refoulement obligations and that removal would not breach Australia's international obligations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Home Affairs Portfolio Ministers have personal intervention powers under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span> (the Act) that allow them to grant a visa to a person, if they think it is in the public interest to do so. The public interest powers are non-compellable, that is, the Ministers are not required to exercise these powers. It is for the Ministers to define what is in the public interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I exercised my non-compellable power under section 197AB of the Act to place the family into a residence determination arrangement in Perth, Western Australia. I also exercised my non-compellable power under section 195A of the Act to grant further bridging visas to three members of the family.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3158 calling on the Australian Government to introduce or import China's COVID-19 vaccines as soon as possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. Moreover, the safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia. All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk-management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), Moderna and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines have been provisionally approved after a complete assessment of all the available data and the Novavax vaccine is currently under evaluation. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines have subsequently been used in Australia's national vaccine rollout, while the Janssen vaccine has not been utilised, though it is provisionally approved.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This approval process is the same process as any vaccine approved in this country. The TGA will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. No part of the Process has been rushed, and there was no emergency authorisation granted as the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The urgency of the global pandemic means that researchers, agencies such as the World Health Organization and governments all over the world are prioritising the development, assessment, and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA requires robust scientific data before supporting a vaccine candidate and will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is found to be safe and effective, following its complete assessment of data. Information regarding COVID-19 vaccines under evaluation can be found at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines-undergoing-evaluation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With rolling submission, collaboration with international regulators, and proactively working with sponsors, the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines including Novavax is being significantly expedited without compromising on our strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy. However, the timeframe will ultimately depend on when the complete data package is provided by sponsors to enable the required regulatory processes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts globally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are more than 400 trials for 140 vaccine candidates worldwide, including a number that are trialling the use of needle-free technology. These include nasal sprays, oral tablets, skin patches and jet injectors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Future investments in COVID-19 vaccine candidates and manufacturing options are subject to the advice of the COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments for Australia—Science and Industry Technical Advisory Group, and assessment of clinical evidence, including portfolio diversification and risk.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with the Operation COVID Shield National COVID-19 Vaccine Campaign Plan.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 enclosing petition EN3161, with 34 signatures, on the situation in Afghanistan. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, Afghan citizens are a prominent caseload in Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program and have been in the top five countries of origin over the last five years. The Australian Government announced on 18 August 2021 that Afghan citizens will be prioritised for processing within the offshore Humanitarian Program. An initial 3,000 humanitarian places have been allocated to Afghan nationals within Australia's 13,750 annual program. Particular priority will be given to persecuted minorities, women and children, and those who have close links to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government anticipates this initial allocation will increase further over the course of 2021-22. We are working with Afghan community leaders here in Australia, and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to identify and resettle those Afghan refugees most in need. The Government established an Advisory Panel on Australia's Resettlement of Afghan Nationals on 25 August 2021 to provide advice and support to the Government and the Department of Home Affairs to ensure that that resettlement planning, service provision, and goodwill across communities is harnessed for the Afghan cohort.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you would appreciate, the Government is focussed on ensuring that the Australian response, including further consideration of Humanitarian Program settings, is well considered and meets the needs and priorities of the Afghan community. The Government will make further announcements on the composition and priorities in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has allocated new funding of $27.1 million over two years for a tailored Afghan settlement support package, to help recent evacuees from Afghanistan settle successfully into their new lives in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Afghan settlement support package is informed by advice from the Government's Advisory Panel on Australia's Resettlement of Afghan Nationals and includes:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$8.0 million over two years to further strengthen the capacity of community and grass roots organisations to continue to play a critical role in supporting the evacuees to begin their lives in Australia;</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$7.9 million to the Program of Assistance for Survivors of Torture and Trauma (PASTT) to support evacuees and the Afghan community in accessing targeted mental health support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners raise concerns regarding Afghan nationals who were granted a Humanitarian Stay (Temporary) (subclass 449) visa. These visas were granted due to the rapidly changing security circumstances in Afghanistan, the urgent and exceptional humanitarian nature of the evacuation operation and the limited window for people to depart Afghanistan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 November 2021, the Government announced that the subclass 449 visas granted to Afghans who supported Australia's mission in Afghanistan and their families, who have not yet arrived in Australia, will be extended on an ongoing basis. Those outside of this group who previously held a temporary humanitarian visa will be prioritised within Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian intake.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For those subclass 449 visa holders in Australia, on 12 November 2021, the Government announced changes to migration legislation to support Afghan nationals recently evacuated from Afghanistan to undertake permanent visa processes in Australia. These changes support the evacuees through permanent visa processes through the provision of a 12 month extension of their temporary subclass 449 visas. During this time they will also retain access to Commonwealth settlement, health, welfare and income supports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes also provide a clear pathway to permanent residence for those Afghan evacuees located in Australia on subclass 449 visas—either continuing on their existing migration visa pathways, or through the Humanitarian Program. These changes allow Afghan subclass 449 visa holders in Australia to make a valid application for a Refugee and Humanitarian (Class XB) visa in Australia and align to a practicable extent, visa outcomes for this group with what they would likely have received through the Humanitarian Program, if they did not need urgent evacuation from Afghanistan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government is working to ensure that visa options continue to be available to Afghan nationals, both within Afghanistan and those who have been displaced from their home country. All visa applications will be processed in accordance with Government announcements and within program priorities, and assessed on an individual basis. All visa applicants must also meet visa criteria and satisfy public interest criteria for character, security and health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visa processing times can vary according to the particular circumstances of the applicant, their location (be it inside or outside their home country), and their ability to travel, provide documents or access Australian government officials. The Government understands this is a distressing time for many people, including the Australian Afghan community, and request patience with the application process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regards to the provision of aid, on 13 September 2021, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Manse Payne, announced that Australia will contribute $100 million in humanitarian assistance to respond to the Afghanistan crisis from 2021-24. This includes around $65 million in immediate lifesaving assistance and support to the neighbouring countries hosting Afghan refugees and around $35 million to address the protracted nature of the humanitarian crisis out to 2024. The Government will work through United Nations humanitarian partners, with a specific focus on supporting women and girls.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For those remaining in Afghanistan, the situation remains highly volatile, and travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous. Some borders are closed or may close without notice (as outlined in Smartraveller advice). We urge all people remaining in Afghanistan to prioritise their safety and carefully consider the risks should they attempt to leave by any route.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan Australians are an integral part of Australian society and the Australian community. The Government is endeavouring to do all we can to continue to assist those affected through our ongoing humanitarian, whole-of-government and collaborative efforts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 enclosing Petition EN3177, with 19 signatures, concerning the situation in Afghanistan. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is supporting those impacted by the crisis through our humanitarian response. Australia evacuated around 4,100 people on 32 flights from Kabul from 8 to 26 August 2021. The Government is committed to providing holistic support for Afghan evacuees, who will receive immediate settlement support to access essential services and integrate into Australian life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is one of only a small number of countries that operate well-established and successful resettlement programs, and continues to offer one of the largest resettlement programs on both an absolute and per capita basis. Australia has a long tradition of resettling refugees and people in humanitarian need from around the world, successfully settling more than 920,000 refugees and others in humanitarian need since the end of the Second World War.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan citizens are a prominent caseload in Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program and have been in the top five countries of origin over the last five years. The Government announced on 18 August 2021 that Afghan citizens will be prioritised for processing within the offshore Humanitarian Program. An initial 3,000 humanitarian places have been allocated to Afghan nationals within Australia's 13,750 annual program. Particular priority will be given to persecuted minorities, women and children, and those who have links to Australia. The Government anticipates this initial allocation will increase further over the course of 2021-22. The Government is working with Afghan community leaders here in Australia, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to identify and resettle those Afghan refugees most in need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is working to ensure that visa options continue to be available to Afghan nationals, both within Afghanistan and those displaced from their home country, through Australia's long-standing Humanitarian and Migration Programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan nationals who need to lodge or enquire about a visa or citizenship application can contact +61 2 6196 0196 or visit the Department of Home Affairs website, which provides clear information on visa lodgement channels and requirements. If people are having difficulty accessing communications to apply, another person can apply on their behalf. All visa applications will be processed in accordance with Government announcements and within program priorities, and assessed on an individual basis. All applicants for the Humanitarian Program must meet the visa criteria and satisfy public interest criteria for character, security and health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visa processing times can vary according to the particular circumstances of the applicant, their location (be it inside or outside their home country), and their ability to travel, provide documents or access Australian government officials. We know this is a distressing time for many people, including our Australian Afghan community, and request patience with the application process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan Australians are an integral part of Australian society and the Australian community. The Government is endeavouring to do all we can to continue to assist those affected through our ongoing humanitarian, whole-of-government and collaborative efforts.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Vaccination</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3182 calling on the Australian Government to immediately Approve and Rollout Novavax.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safety of the Australian population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For this reason, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. With rolling submission, collaboration with international regulators, and proactively working with sponsors, the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines including Novavax is being significantly expedited without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy. In January 2021 the TGA granted provisional determination to Novavax. The next step in the approval process is for the sponsor to submit an application for provisional registration in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). This submission includes a comprehensive dossier that includes specific information on clinical studies, non-clinical/toxicology studies, chemistry, manufacturing, risk-management and other information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Novavax submitted initial data in February 2021 and, as part of their rolling submission, provided its initial quality data tranche in November 2021. The TGA is currently evaluating this data and is in the process of obtaining further information and clarification from the sponsor as the evaluation progresses, as well as being informed by the advice of the Advisory Committee on Vaccines, an independent committee of external experts. More information can be found on the TGA website at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines-undergoing-evaluation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has invested in a diverse portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines that use a variety of technical platforms, entering into five separate Advance Purchase Agreements for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines, if they prove to be safe and effective. These include agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Moderna and the international COVAX. Combined, these agreements will ensure Australia has access to more than 280 million vaccine doses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is open and transparent about safety information relating to COVID-19 vaccines, including any suspected side-effects or potential safety issues. The TGA publishes a weekly safety report, including information about reported suspected side-effects, as well as other safety alerts as required. More information can be found at: vvww.tga.gov.au using the search terms 'COVID-19-vaccine safety monitoring and reporting'. Product information and consumer medicines information including ingredient listings for all provisionally approved vaccines can also be located on the TGA's website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The goal is to protect all people in Australia from the harm caused COVID-19 infection, through preventing serious illness and death, and where possible, disease transmission. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna vaccines have all been proven through approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 October 2021, all Australians 12 years of age and over, including those Australians 60 years of age and over, are now eligible to receive a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. This means older Australians can now choose the Pfizer, Moderna, or AstraZeneca vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important for Australians to have access to credible and timely information about COVID-19 vaccines. It is a large and complex project, and the information you are seeking may change over time—that is why we strongly encourage all Australians stay up-to-date on all news and announcements, by regularly checking my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is supporting those impacted by the crisis in Afghanistan through our humanitarian response. Australia evacuated around 4,100 people on 32 flights from Kabul from 8 to 26 August 2021. The Government is committed to providing holistic support for Afghan evacuees, who will receive immediate settlement support to access essential services and integrate into Australian life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is one of only a small number of countries that operate well-established and successful resettlement programs, and continues to offer one of the largest resettlement programs on both an absolute and per capita basis. Australia has a long tradition of resettling refugees and people in humanitarian need from around the world, successfully settling more than 920,000 refugees and others in humanitarian need since the end of the Second World War.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan citizens are a prominent caseload in Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program and have been in the top five countries of origin over the last five years. The Government announced on 18 August 2021 that Afghan citizens will be prioritised for processing within the offshore Humanitarian Program. An initial 3,000 humanitarian places have been allocated to Afghan nationals within Australia's 13,750 annual program. Particular priority will be given to persecuted minorities, women and children, and those who have links to Australia. The Government anticipates this initial allocation will increase further over the course of 2021-22. The Government is working with Afghan community leaders here in Australia, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to identify and resettle those Afghan refugees most in need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government announced new funding of $27.1 million over two years for a tailored Afghan settlement support package, to help recent evacuees from Afghanistan settle successfully into their new lives in Australia. The Afghan settlement support package is informed by advice from the Government's Advisory Panel on Australia's Resettlement of Afghan Nationals. The Panel continues to play a critical role in advising the Government on its Afghan settlement response, and I am grateful for the advice this panel continues to provide.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This funding recognises Australia's long involvement in, and commitment to, Afghanistan and its people, and the unique challenges and needs of those rescued from Kabul. It will provide effective support and care for new arrivals and set them up for successful settlement into the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is working to ensure that visa options continue to be available to Afghan nationals, both within Afghanistan and those displaced from their home country, through Australia's long-standing Humanitarian and Migration Programs. All visa applications will be processed in accordance with Government announcements and within program priorities, and assessed on an individual basis. All visa applicants must meet the visa criteria and satisfy public interest criteria for character, security and health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visa processing times can vary according to the particular circumstances of the applicant, their location (be it inside or outside their home country), and their ability to travel, provide documents or access Australian government officials. The Government understands this is a distressing time for many people, including the Australian Afghan community, and request patience with the application process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan Australians are an integral part of Australian society and the Australian community. The Government is endeavouring to do all we can to continue to assist those affected through our ongoing humanitarian, whole-of-government and collaborative efforts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">JobKeeper Payment</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning Petition EN3207, which requests that businesses be required to return JobKeeper payments in certain circumstances. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was designed during a period when widespread public health restrictions were being imposed to control the spread of COVID-19. The purpose of JobKeeper was to support business and job survival, keep employees connected to their employers, and provide income support to individuals. It achieved these purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given the uncertainty at the time, eligibility for JobKeeper was initially based on a prospective decline in turnover test. A prospective test allowed eligibility to be determined almost immediately for businesses, which in turn allowed for JobKeeper payments to quickly be passed through to employees. Once a business had qualified, support was guaranteed for six months to provide certainty to businesses and this was based on the health advice at the time regarding the possible duration and nature of restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is administering the payment and provided guidance to businesses on the test, including the evidence they needed to retain in support of their eligibility. The ATO has established that the vast majority of JobKeeper businesses reasonably estimated their projected decline in turnover. For those JobKeeper businesses which the ATO determined did not reasonably estimate their projected the decline in turnover, the ATO was either able to prevent these claims prior to payment or take compliance action to recover these payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some businesses were able to recover more quickly than others. The JobKeeper Payment did not include a mechanism to claw back payments from businesses that performed better than they expected, reflecting a desire to avoid any disincentives for businesses to adapt and recover. The introduction of such a mechanism would likely have reduced the overall level of economic activity and slowed the recovery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst some businesses may not have experienced a 30 per cent decline in turnover during the first six months of JobKeeper, this does not necessarily mean the business was not adversely affected by COVID-19 restrictions. There are a variety of reasons that some businesses that were eligible for JobKeeper but did not end up experiencing their projected decline in turnover including the early easing of health restrictions or because JobKeeper allowed them to adapt their business model and remain operating during the health restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the JobKeeper extension phase, eligibility was retested in both extension periods based on actual declines in turnover in the previous quarter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JobKeeper payments were required to be passed through to eligible employees and there is no legal obligation for businesses who received JobKeeper in accordance with the rules to repay those amounts. However, a business may choose to voluntarily pay an amount which is equivalent to some or all of the JobKeeper payments that they received. A number of businesses have made voluntary repayments and the ATO has provided guidance on how businesses can repay some or all of their JobKeeper payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning petition number EN3208 on banning mass distribution of fridge magnets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes the issue of waste and its impacts on the environment very seriously. Our National Waste Policy Action Plan includes ambitious national targets to make Australia a world leader in resource management and recovery. For plastic waste, these include a ban on plastic waste exports and a phase-out of problematic and unnecessary plastics through sustainable design, innovation or the introduction of sustainable alternatives by 2025.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are also driving a $1 billion transformation of our waste and recycling industry. The government created the $190 million Recycling Modernisation Fund (RMF) to supercharge investment in recycling infrastructure so that Australia can take responsibility for its own waste. As the waste export ban is phased in, Australia must shift to recycling 645,000 tonnes of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres domestically. Additional recycling infrastructure is required to achieve this. The government has already contributed over $106 million towards 78 RMF projects, that will process over 1.3 million tonnes of plastics, tyres, glass and paper each year. This funding is currently on track to leverage more than $800 million in waste and recycling manufacture infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is also taking action to reduce waste through its $26 million National Product Stewardship Investment fund (NPSIF). The NPSIF aims to increase the number of industry-led product stewardship schemes in Australia. The program's intended outcomes include:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">an increase in new, and expansion of, existing industry-led product stewardship schemes</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is also committed to improving the recyclability of plastics and reducing the impacts of plastic waste on our environment. The government launched the nation's first National Plastics Plan on 4 March 2021. As outlined in the National Plastics Plan, taking responsibility for our waste will, in some instances, mean phasing out problematic and unnecessary single-use plastics, including through design, innovation or by using alternative materials. We are attacking the plastic problem on five key fronts: legislation, investment, industry targets, research and development, and community education. You can read more about the Plan at environment.gov.au/plastics-plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since the release of the Plan the government has also been working with industry on steps to phase out problematic materials including expanded polystyrene (EPS) in loose fill and moulded consumer packaging by July 2022, EPS in food and beverage containers, non-certified compostable packaging as well as PVC labels by December 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the recent Environment Ministers Meeting, Environment Ministers identified eight `problematic and unnecessary' plastic product types for industry to phase out nationally by 2025 (or sooner in some cases) under the National Waste Policy Action Plan. These are lightweight plastic bags, plastic products misleadingly termed as `degradable', plastic straws, plastic bowls and plates, plastic utensils and stirrers, EPS consumer food containers (e.g. cups and clamshells), EPS consumer goods packaging (loose fill and moulded) and microbeads in personal health care products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is also investing over $20 million through a special round of the Cooperative Research Centres Projects to find new and innovative solutions to plastic recycling and waste, including new ways of incorporating recycled plastics in manufacturing and construction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are also range of measures at all levels of government to ensure waste is managed effectively. State and territory governments have primary responsibility for regulating and administering waste, including planning for waste management and waste avoidance, minimisation, and reuse; resource recovery and disposal; and managing the impacts of waste management activities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The responsibility for legislating the phase-out of problematic and unnecessary single use plastics, including composite materials such as magnets, belongs to state and territory governments. As the parties who submitted the petition are seeking to make the mass distribution of fridge magnets illegal, they may wish to contact their state or territory government representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I hope this information serves to demonstrate that tackling waste and plastic pollution in all forms is a major priority for the government. We are committed to addressing this significant national challenge in close collaboration with industry and state and territory governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3240 requesting the Omnipod DASH Insulin Delivery System (Omnipod) be added to the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the significant impact diabetes has on people with diabetes and their families and is committed to working towards the broad prevention of the disease in the Australian community. The Omnipod system is a new style of insulin pump for which there are no directly comparable products currently subsidised through the NDSS. The product sponsor for Omnipod has submitted a request for subsidisation of this product and my Department is currently working with the sponsor to identify a potential funding pathway. Depending on the outcome of this process, a decision to list Omnipod on the NDSS product schedule may need to be considered through the Federal Budget process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the OmniPod DASH system is not currently included on the NDSS, a range of insulin pump consumables are currently subsidised. Further information about NDSS products, and more specifically insulin pump consumables, can be found at: www.ndss.com.au. </span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides considerable financial support to people with diabetes through the subsidy of essential medicines, like insulin, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and diabetes-related products, like blood glucose test strips, through the NDSS. In 2020-21, PBS expenditure on medicines for diabetes was over $709 million and expenditure on products for diabetes supplied through the NDSS was $186 million.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 23 November 2021 regarding Petition EN3241.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a party to the seven core international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Australia's obligations under these treaties are implemented through a range of laws, policies and programs at the federal and state and territory levels.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International human rights law recognises that restrictions on rights, such as the right to freedom of movement and explusion of aliens in articles 12 and 13 of the ICCPR respectively, may be limited in certain circumstances. However, to strike an appropriate balance, such measures must be necessary and proportionate to the evaluated risk, must respect people's dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms and be in place for the shortest time possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes its obligations under international human rights law seriously, and implements those obligations in good faith. Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011</span>, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights is empowered to scrutinise all legislation for compatibility with human rights, including the ICCPR. All government non-legislative proposals are also informed by appropriate legal advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers that mechanisms to protect and promote human rights are appropriate. On this basis, the Government does not propose to ban identity cards in any form.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 November 2021 regarding Petition Ministerial Referral (EN3280).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is home to a diversity of faiths, united by tolerance, mutual respect and a commitment to democratic traditions. All Australians are free to choose their religion, and are entitled to express and practise their religion and their beliefs, without intimidation or interference within the framework of Australian law. This means that Australians who hold religious views should not face discrimination on the basis of those views.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not support prejudice or bias towards any religious group and takes the issue of discrimination against Australians on the grounds of their religious beliefs very seriously. In saying this, the Government does not intend on imposing a ban on certain terminology but encourages the use of language that is non-discriminatory and appropriate for the purpose of those communications.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning petition number EN3282 concerning the addition to Medicare of wisdom tooth extraction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands the importance of good oral health and its role in supporting general health and wellbeing. States and territories have primary responsibility for public dental services—including, funding, management of waiting lists and determining the scope and availability of services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has supported states and territories through a National Partnership Agreement (NPA) on Public Dental Services for Adults. Between 1 January 2017 and 30 June 2021 the NPA provided $458.1 million in funding and supported services to around 763,000 public dental patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2021-22 Budget, the Government announced $107.8 million to extend support for adult public services through a Federation Funding Agreement (FFA) until 30 June 2022. The FFA will provide services to an additional 180,000 public dental patients while the Australian Government and state and territory governments negotiate on options for long-term funding arrangements for public dental services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also supports the provision of dental services for children through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS). Since its commencement on 1 January 2014, the CDBS has provided over $2.4 billion in benefits and delivered over 39 million services to more than three million children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the National Health Reform Agreement, the Government contributes funds to the states and territories for dental services delivered through public hospitals. This includes services provided through emergency departments, hospitals, and community health settings. Between 2017-18 and 2019-20 the Government provided approximately $541 million in funding for these services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also supports access to private sector dental services through the Private Health Insurance (PHI) rebate. In the 2021-22 Budget $6.7 billion ($27.8 billion between 2021-22 and 2024-25) was committed for the PHI rebate, to make private health insurance more affordable. In 2018-19, $718 million was provided to support dental services through the PHI Rebate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With concerns to pathways for assistance with the cost of treatment for the removal of wisdom teeth, private health insurance products may provide some support for services delivered in an ambulatory or admitted in-hospital setting. The scope and degree of this assistance will depend on the type of cover and the policy of the insurer. Patients may wish to contact their private health insurer to check what services are covered under their policy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The public sector may also provide some access to services for the removal of wisdom teeth. Specific arrangements depend on the policies of state and territory government and may be limited to complex cases and high needs patients. Patients may wish to contact their state or territory government to check their eligibility for public dental services and what options may be available to them.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The human biosecurity emergency period declared under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015 </span>(Act), which has been in place since 18 March 2020 to protect Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic, will continue until 17 December 2021 unless extended by the Governor-General.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The original declaration of the human biosecurity emergency, and every extension made by the Governor-General, is informed by specialist medical and epidemiological advice provided by expert medical bodies, such as the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, and the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer. The declaration has been extended several times since commencing in March 2020 because, based on the available public health evidence, I was satisfied with the criteria set out in the Act. At every stage, the Australian Government's priority has been the health and safety of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The human biosecurity emergency period is due to lapse on 17 December 2021. An extension for a further three months will be considered in due course, particularly noting the new variant of concern 'Omicron'. The Government is closely monitoring the evolving evidence relevant to the assessment of public health risk to Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 November 2021 regarding Petition EN3351. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises concerns about '90 year suppression orders' that were purportedly made over documents provided to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service (Wood Royal Commission) and the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The Wood Royal Commission was established by New South Wales, the state to which any concerns should be directed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised that no such suppression orders have been made by Commonwealth Parliament or any federal court. This Government did bring forward amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Commissions Act 1902</span> to exclude information obtained at a private session from public access for 99 years. These relate to section 60M of that Act. The personal and sensitive nature of people's accounts of how they have been affected by child sexual abuse justified this action.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also raises concerns about alleged corruption in public institutions. The Australian Government is committed to ensuring our federal integrity framework is as robust as possible and is delivering on its promise to establish a Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC). The CIC will be an independent investigative agency with strong powers to target the most serious types of criminal corruption that threaten good public administration. The CIC will have broad jurisdiction over all Commonwealth entities, including law enforcement and public sector agencies, parliamentarians and their offices, higher education providers and research bodies. It will complement, rather than duplicate, other mechanisms that already exist to deal with misconduct at the Commonwealth level.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition number EN3353 COVID-19 vaccine freedom to choose for people aged 59 years and over.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safety of the Australian population has always been the highest priority of the Australian Government. For this reason, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>

Informed consent will always be gained prior to vaccination.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important for Australians to have access to credible and timely information about COVID-19 vaccines.

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning request to increase the age of consent to 16 for COVID-19 vaccinations (petition number EN3359).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Anyone under 18 years is considered a child for the purposes of medical treatment. In general, a parent or legal guardian of a child has the authority to consent to that child being vaccinated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, some states and territories have legislation that addresses the issue of a child's consent to medical treatment. The common law applies in jurisdictions that do not have such legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under this common law often referred to as Mature Minor or Gillick competence, all medical practitioners are permitted to assess an adolescent's competence and maturity to consent to medical care including vaccination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For certain procedures, including vaccination, a child or adolescent may be determined to be mature enough to understand the proposed procedure, and the risks and benefits associated with it. These young people may have the capacity to consent under certain circumstances. If a child or adolescent refuses a vaccination that a parent or guardian has given consent for, the child or adolescent's wishes are respected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department has developed a consent form for COVID-19 vaccination as an example for vaccination providers to obtain patient consent prior to COVID-19 vaccination. However, the use of the form is not mandatory. Informed consent should be obtained as per usual consent procedures for other vaccinations. Verbal or implied consent is acceptable and written consent is not required.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As states and territories manage consent to medical treatment for children differently, I encourage you to work with jurisdictional health authorities on this matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 November 2021 regarding Petition EN3374. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises concerns about '90 year suppression orders' that were purportedly made over documents provided to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service (Wood Royal Commission) and the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The Wood Royal Commission was established by New South Wales, to whom any concerns should be directed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised that no such suppression orders have been made by Commonwealth Parliament or any federal court. This Government did bring forward amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Commissions Act 1902</span> to exclude information obtained at a private session from public access for 99 years. These concern section 60M of that Act. The personal and sensitive nature of people's accounts of how they have been affected by child sexual abuse justified this action.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also raises concerns about alleged corruption in public institutions. The Australian Government is committed to ensuring our federal integrity framework is as robust as possible and is delivering on its promise to establish a Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC). The CIC will be an independent investigative agency with strong powers to target the most serious types of criminal corruption that threaten good public administration. The CIC will have broad jurisdiction over all Commonwealth entities, including law enforcement and public sector agencies, parliamentarians and their offices, higher education providers and research bodies. It will complement, rather than duplicate, other mechanisms that already exist to deal with misconduct at the Commonwealth level.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CIC will not have jurisdiction over the judiciary or judicial conduct. It is an essential feature of the Australian system of government that our courts are independent and free from interference from the executive arm of government. Consistent with this independence, the federal courts are each responsible for their own operation and management, including the handling of complaints regarding the judiciary and judicial conduct.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition number EN3413 and can provide the following advice in response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before any COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use in Australia it is subject to the stringent assessment and approval processes of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. The TGA rigorously assesses all vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness. The approvals are subject to certain strict conditions, such as the requirement for sponsors to continue providing information to the TGA on longer term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and post-market assessment. Emerging clinical trial evidence, as well as real world data, continues to be monitored by technical experts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA provisionally approved the Comirnaty (Pfizer), Spikevax (Moderna) and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) vaccines after a complete assessment of all the available data. This is the same process as any vaccine approved in this country. The TGA will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government encourages all eligible Australians to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they are eligible, vaccination in Australia is voluntary, and individuals need to undertake appropriate individual risk-benefit analysis and give informed consent before being vaccinated against COVID-19. There is a wide range of resources available to the general public to inform their decision-making.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of a vaccine's provisional approval process, the TGA requires that a comprehensive Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) leaflet and Product Information (PI) document be available for healthcare professionals and consumers for all prescription medicines. These documents are available at: www.tga.gov.au using the search term `COVID-19 vaccines: information for consumers and health professionals'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CMI leaflet contains information for consumers on the safe and effective use of a vaccine, including side effects. It also contains a list of all ingredients found in the vaccine. The PI provides information for healthcare professionals to guide their prescribing, dispensing and administering decisions and to assist them to provide patient education, and also includes a list of all ingredients found in the vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA monitors the safety of vaccines after they are registered in Australia so that any safety concerns can be detected and responded to. TGA publishes weekly COVID-19 vaccine safety reports that include information about reported suspected side effects and other safety information from Australia and overseas. These reports are available at: www.tga.gov.au using the search term `COVID-19 vaccine weekly safety report'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Active surveillance is also undertaken through the AusVaxSafety surveillance system, which sends follow up messages to recipients of COVID-19 vaccines to ask if they have experienced any potential side effects. The results of this surveillance monitoring are available at: www.ausvaxsafety.org.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Informed consent for COVID-19 vaccines should be obtained as per usual consent procedures for other vaccinations. This can depend on the state or territory in which the vaccine is being obtained. Verbal or implied consent is acceptable and written consent is not required.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaccination providers can use the 'Consent form for COVID-19 vaccination', which is available on my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au using the search term `COVID-19 vaccination provider resources'. The form is provided as an example and use of the form is not mandatory. Vaccination providers are welcome to use the form as presented or adapt the content for their unique requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccination providers must undertake a mandatory online COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program. The program is comprehensive and is informed by the latest advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee , the TGA, the World Health Organisation, and clinical experts across my Department.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program outlines specific questions that need to be discussed with patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination. This supplementary screening includes questions that cover contraindications and precautions, pregnancy and breastfeeding, age, immunocompromised individuals, and current symptoms or illness, and is in addition to the standard pre-screening checklist in the Australian Immunisation Handbook, the</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Specific precautions for each COVID-19 vaccine are covered within focussed training modules for each COVID-19 vaccine. Providers are required to complete each vaccine-specific module for the vaccines they administer. Updates are regularly provided to health professionals to ensure that best practice clinical information is available and followed. These updates reflect the latest findings of global clinical trials and research regarding risks, benefits and efficacy of vaccines for various cohorts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department continues to provide accurate, evidence-based information on COVID-19 vaccines to the public, and clinical guidance for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines to health practitioners. Consumer resources on COVID-19 vaccines are available on my Department's website to ensure people can be informed about COVID-19 vaccines. These resources cover the different COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia and include information on preparing for vaccination and what to do after vaccination. These resources are available at: www.health.gov.au using the search term `COVID-19 vaccination patient resources'.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department's COVID-19 communications materials strongly encourage individuals to seek expert medical advice from their GP if they have any questions or concerns about COVID-19 vaccination. GPs and other healthcare providers are able to provide advice specific to the circumstances of each individual.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ATAGI has developed a number of resources to assist people with their decision-making and to inform their discussions with their GP or other healthcare provider. Resources include ATAGI's clinical guidance, shared decision-making guides and statements on use of COVID-19 vaccine in outbreak settings. These resources are available at the above links (provider or patient resources). All resources include a reference list with links to the research, studies and other information that have informed the development of that advice.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ATAGI meets weekly to consider emerging evidence and information (including safety monitoring information and weekly safety data published by the TGA) and recommendations may be updated as required. ATAGI publishes statements following these meetings to ensure the general public has access to the most up-to-date information, including rare but potentially serious adverse events following immunisation. These statements are available at: www.health.gov.au using the search term 'ATAGI' and clicking on the link to 'Statements'.</span>

As the vaccine is not mandatory and has been approved by a regulatory body for use in the general population, it is considered that the Nuremberg Code does not apply to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning your request to examine COVID-19 vaccine side effects (petition number EN3430).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before any COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use in Australia, it is subject to the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) stringent assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials. These trials, involving tens of thousands of participants, have shown that Australia's COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing people from developing symptomatic COVID-19 and protect individuals against severe illness or death associated with COVID-19 infection. The TGA collects and evaluates reports of suspected side effects and has been doing so since the start of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This adverse event reporting is collected directly from health professionals and consumers, as well as through state and territory health departments, other Australian vaccine safety organisations and vaccine sponsors. Adverse events reported to the TGA are not necessarily caused by the vaccine. TGA reviews adverse event reports to look for any patterns that indicate a possible safety issue that should be investigated and thoroughly investigates these issues to determine what action is required, if any, to maintain public safety. TGA publishes the weekly outcomes of its ongoing monitoring and safety investigation of COVID-19 vaccines at: www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines are based on the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). ATAGI closely monitors local and international epidemiological data in relation to COVID-19 and vaccines and is currently meeting weekly to consider emerging evidence and information, including safety monitoring information and data from the TGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can therefore be confident that the safety of the Australian population has always been the Australian Government's highest priority.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 November 2021 regarding Petition EN3442, which requests the establishment of a federal anti-corruption body. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring our federal integrity framework is as robust as possible and is delivering on its promise to establish a Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC). The Government committed ongoing funding to the CIC in the 2019-20 Budget. Total funding over the next four financial years from 2021-22 would be $165.6 million.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CIC will be an independent investigative agency with strong powers to target the most serious types of criminal conduct that threaten good public administration. The CIC will have broad jurisdiction over all Commonwealth entities, including law enforcement and public sector agencies, parliamentarians and their offices, higher education providers and research bodies. It will complement, rather than duplicate, other mechanisms which already exist to deal with issues of misconduct at the Commonwealth level. It will also complement integrity agencies that have been established by states and territories to deal with alleged corruption that falls within their areas of responsibility under Australia's federal system of government, including allegations relating to councils and state and territory government agencies and parliamentarians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is significant legislation that must be implemented effectively, both because of the scale of the reforms and because it is vital that Australians can have confidence that the CIC will operate fairly and effectively.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 November 2021 regarding Petition Number EN3457 relating to the 'right to disconnect'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's industrial relations system has existing flexible and adaptable mechanisms for employers and employees to cooperatively respond to emerging issues. Modern awards, a unique feature of Australian industrial relations, are instruments that set employment conditions that recognise different needs across industries and occupations. The Fair Work Commission can hear applications from employees, employers and their representatives to vary awards to meet emerging needs or changing conditions at any time. Enterprise bargaining can also set terms and conditions at the workplace level that respond to emerging issues, for example the 'right to disconnect' clause in Victoria Police's recent enterprise agreement as highlighted in the petition. Other individual companies, such as BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler, are also adopting policies limiting out-of-hours communication.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to 'burnout' as a work health and safety (WHS) issue, under the model WHS laws, persons conducting a business or undertaking, such as an employer, have a duty to ensure that all persons in the workplace, including workers, are not exposed to health and safety risks as far as reasonably practicable. A failure to comply with WHS duties can result in severe penalties and prosecution. In acknowledging the importance of managing mental health in the workplace, on 20 May 2021, WHS Ministers agreed to amend the model WHS Regulations to deal with psychological injury and protect workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to monitor developments in Australia and overseas in response to this issue.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 November 2021 regarding Petition EN3470, which requests the establishment of a federal anti-corruption body. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring our federal integrity framework is as robust as possible and is delivering on its promise to establish a Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC). The Government committed ongoing funding to the CIC in the 2019-20 Budget. Total funding over the next four financial years from 2021-22 would be $165.6 million.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CIC will be an independent investigative agency with strong powers to target the most serious types of criminal conduct that threaten good public administration. The CIC will have broad jurisdiction over all Commonwealth entities, including law enforcement and public sector agencies, parliamentarians and their offices, higher education providers and research bodies. It will complement, rather than duplicate, other mechanisms which already exist to deal with issues of misconduct at the Commonwealth level. It will also complement integrity agencies that have been established by states and territories to deal with alleged corruption that falls within their areas of responsibility under Australia's federal system of government, including allegations relating to councils and state and territory government agencies and parliamentarians.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3480 requesting all concession card holders be bulk billed automatically.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting all Australians to access quality and affordable health care by providing rebates for services listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). Through the 2021-22 Budget, the Government is investing $125.7 billion over the forward estimates, an increase of over $6 billion, as part of its ongoing commitment to guarantee Medicare for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is responsible for setting the level of Medicare rebates available to patients, it has no authority to set the fees that specialists and GPs charge for their services. Medical practices are private businesses and determine their own fee arrangements, including whether they bulk bill their patients or charge co-payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The latest Medicare data shows that more Australians than ever are getting the medical care they need at no cost to themselves. For example, GP bulk billing rates reached an all-time high of 88.7 per cent for the period July 2020 to March 2021. This is three percentage points higher than the same period last year (85.7 per cent) and 6.7 percentage points higher than the same period in 2012-13 (82 per cent). Across all Medicare services, the bulk billing rate reached 80.9 per cent, an increase of 4.4 percentage points since 2012-13.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's rapid and effective response to COVID-19 is reflected in these figures. Telehealth changes to Medicare introduced for the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to high bulk billing, while also reducing the risk of spreading the disease in the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since the COVID-19 telehealth items were introduced in March 2020, almost 86.5 million telehealth services have been delivered to 16.1 million patients, with almost $4.4 billion in benefits paid. Over 89,110 providers have used telehealth services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Patients should speak to their medical provider regarding fees or the possibility of bulkbilling. Doctors are encouraged to consider the personal circumstances of their patients when determining the fee they charge, and many do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To encourage GPs to bulk bill, the Government provides financial incentives for bulk billed services provided to Commonwealth concession card holders and patients under the age of 16. Currently the incentives are set at $6.55 per bulk billed service in metropolitan areas, and $9.90 per bulk billed service in regional, rural and remote areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To assist patients with out-of-pocket costs the Extended Medicare Safety Net provides additional Medicare benefits for Australians who have out-of-pocket costs for Medicare eligible out-of-hospital services once an annual threshold has been met.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As of January 2021, the general annual threshold is $2,184.30. For Commonwealth concession cardholders, including those with a Pension Concession Card, the annual threshold is $697.00. Medicare keeps a tally of out-of-pocket medical expenses and will increase the rebates once the threshold is reached.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If any of the signatories require a bulk billed health service, you may like to recommend the 'find a service' feature of the healthdirect website at: www.healthdirect.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Healthdirect is funded by the Australian and state and territory governments, and helps patients identify a range of local health services, by location, with a range of filters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The search results include information about a practice's billing policy—whether fees apply, if bulk billing is available for some patients, or if all services are bulk billed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 21 February 2021 concerning petition number PN0498 on the Modified Monash Model (MMM) 2019 classification of Mount Compass, South Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Please note I have previously responded in April 2020 to the Mount Compass Medical Centre in relation to their classification under the MMM 2019. There has been no change to the classification of the Mount Compass Medical Centre, since it was classified as MM 2 in 2015 upon introduction of the MMM.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the Minister for Regional Health, Regional Communications and Local Government, the Hon Mark Coulton MP, has also provided information to the Mount Compass Medical Centre on their MMM classification as well as supporting Australian Government programs and incentives available to the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As advised to the Mount Compass Medical Centre, my Department uses the MMM to better target health workforce programs by categorising metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas according to both geographical remoteness, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), and town size. The MMM is a well-established geographical classification system providing further support to rural and remote Australia. It provides the basis for scaling incentives for medical practices to encourage doctors to remain in more rural and remote areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The MMM defines towns and cities by using the ABS Urban Centres and Localities (UCL) geographic data set. Under the ABS definition, Adelaide extends south to include the area of Sellicks Beach and the calculation used for distance measures from the edge of the larger UCL of Adelaide to the geographical midpoint of the Statistical Area Level 1 of Mount Compass.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The address of the Mount Compass Medical Centre is within 20 km of the edge of the Adelaide UCL. This means the location of Mount Compass is a MM 2 classification. The surrounding towns of Yankalilla and Keith and are classified as MM 5 as they are greater than 20 km from the boundary of Adelaide.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government established the Distribution Advisory Group (Group) to provide advice on towns raising concerns about their geographical classifications. In December 2019, this Group agreed that the MMM is a data based geographical classification system, and discretionary changes cannot be made to the classification of an area as a result. The Group agreed that any discretion as to program eligibility should be made within the context of individual programs and areas raising concerns should contact individual program administrators in relation to this.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also uses the Distribution Priority Area (DPA) system to identify and address the maldistribution of the medical workforce in Australia. The DPA takes into consideration where patients access their services, as well as the services required by the community. Mount Compass has been classified as non-DPA meaning the area has been assessed as receiving adequate GP services for the needs of the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DPA is reviewed and updated annually to reflect the latest available data. An annual update ensures any significant changes, including growth in population or significant reduction in services are accurately reflected. The next annual update to the DPA is scheduled for July 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">DPA status supports other programs. For example, recruitment can be targeted at new entrant International Medical Graduates and/or Bonded Doctors with return of service obligations. While I acknowledge that practices located in non-DPA areas may face recruitment challenges, there are many areas in greater need of GPs and the Government is committed to addressing this inequality.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides funding for a network of seven Rural Workforce Agencies (RWA), to assist communities that experience difficulties attracting and retaining health professionals into regional, rural and remote areas. These agencies work with local practices, communities and other organisations to ensure that a skilled, well-supported health workforce serves rural Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department has been in contact with the RWA in South Australia, the Rural Doctors Workforce Agency, who have advised that they are aware of the issues the Mount Compass Medical Centre have been having with recruitment and have been providing assistance. The Rural Doctors Workforce agency can be contacted on (08) 8234 8277, or via their website at: www.ruraldoc.com.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 26 October 2021 enclosing Petition PN0519, with 20 signatures, concerning the Australian Government's regional processing arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to providing protection to refugees consistent with the obligations set out in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. Regional processing arrangements provide illegal maritime arrivals an opportunity to have their protection claims assessed, and for those found to be refugees, resettlement in a third country, without compromising Australia's strong border protection policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regional processing is a key pillar of Operation Sovereign Borders and supports the Government's strong border protection policies. These policies have successfully stemmed the flow of illegal maritime ventures to Australia, disrupted people smuggling activities in the region and prevented loss of life at sea.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's policy that persons who arrive in Australia illegally by boat will not be settled in Australia, remains steadfast.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">No transitory persons under regional processing arrangements in Nauru or Papua New Guinea (PNG) are detained. Transitory persons reside in community accommodation arrangements and have no restrictions on their movement. Transitory persons receive a range of services to support their residence in Nauru or PNG, including health and welfare, accommodation, education and employment opportunities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Implementing a strong border policy requires commitment and financial investment. Australia has committed to meet all costs associated with regional processing in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Nauru. Australia is working with regional processing countries to support durable migration pathways for all transferees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitory persons under regional processing arrangements, including those temporarily in Australia, have permanent resettlement options and are being resettled. Transitory persons can seek to resettle in the United States or another third country, settle in PNG, or voluntarily return home or to another country in which they have a right of entry. Transitory persons are encouraged to engage in third country resettlement options and take steps to start the next phase of their lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People who were transferred to Australia for a temporary purpose are subject to return to a regional processing country when they no longer need to remain in Australia. Transitory persons are precluded from seeking protection in Australia and will have their protection claims assessed by either PNG or Nauru. This will continue while they are in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In all its dealings with detainees, the Department of Home Affairs remains committed to ensuring that detainees receive fair and reasonable treatment and an efficient standard of service that is sensitive to each of their needs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition PN0519 to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Safety, Compensation and Rehabilitation Act</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 October 2021 enclosing Petition PN0520 regarding the <span style="font-style:italic;">Safety, Rehabilitation a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nd Compensation Act 1988 </span>(SRC Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Petition contends that the Parliament has allowed an Australian Government department to change the wording of the SRC Act. I can assure the Committee that the SRC Act has not been, and cannot be, amended outside of the Australian Parliament given that Commonwealth laws can only be amended by, or under, the authority of the Parliament. Of relevance to this petition, section 36(1) of the SRC Act, which provides for an assessment of an employee's capability of undertaking a rehabilitation program, has remained unchanged since the Act commenced operation on 24 December 1992.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Comcare was established by the SRC Act as an independent statutory agency responsible for managing and determining workers' compensation claims under the Act. If the petitioner disagrees with a decision made under the SRC Act, the Act provides for the reconsideration and review of determinations and decisions, including by application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The SRC Act does not allow me to issue directions in relation to particular claims or intervene in individual workers' compensation claims.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioner has requested that the House of Representatives issue a direction that Services Australia, Comcare and my department provide written assurance to comply with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Legal Services Directions 2017</span> (Legal Services Directions), waiving reliance on subsections 55ZG(2), 55ZG(3) and 55ZI(2) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Judiciary Act 1903</span>. The Legal Services Directions apply to Services Australia and my department as non-corporate Commonwealth entities. Components of the Legal Services Directions, such as the requirement to comply with the model litigant obligations set out in Appendix B, apply to Comcare as a corporate Commonwealth entity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Legal Services Directions are legally binding and enforceable, therefore a direction from the House to comply with them is unnecessary. The Legal Services Directions are not intended to provide a remedy, cause of action or any personal rights in addition to those already available through administrative or judicial review. This was confirmed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Caporale v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</span> [2013] FCA 427. A direction purportedly waiving reliance on subsections 55ZG(2), 55ZG(3) and 55ZI(2) of the Judiciary Act would be inconsistent with this position.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning Petition EN1384 calling on the Australian Government for closure of Australia's borders and the shutdown of large gatherings. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note Australia's situation concerning the pandemic has changed significantly since the petition was initiated. The Government continues to take a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, based on the latest medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 March 2020, the Governor-General, His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Retd), declared a human biosecurity emergency (Declaration) in relation to COVID-19 under section 475 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015</span> (Act). In response to the Declaration, the Government introduced strict border and quarantine measures to protect the health of the Australian community, in particular the Overseas Travel Ban, and limiting most indoor and outdoor non-essential gatherings, with rules on essential gatherings also in place.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health in their jurisdictions, based on the medical advice from their respective Chief Health Officers. The specific measures imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 in each state and territory, including managing domestic border closures and restrictions on social gatherings within a state/territory, is the responsibility of the respective jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government regularly reviews the emergency directions, to ensure their appropriateness in terms of global and local epidemiology. The Government is considering when and how to reopen our borders safely. However, this will be a step-by-step process underpinned by the latest medical advice and based on robust risk assessments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Petitions Committee can be assured that the Government, along with the states and territories, is taking an evidence-based approach to COVID-19, and is committed to keeping Australians safe.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The inbound and outbound travel restrictions do not apply to freight. Australia values engagement and continued trade with our economic partners in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. If we closed our national borders to all incoming trade through freight, the impact to our Australian economy, small businesses, communities and trading partners would be significant. In response to the Declaration, Australia has maintained import and export activities and operations under strict border and quarantine measures at various state and territory ports of entry. These measures have slowed progress of trade within our borders and while these measures are regrettable, they are necessary to protect the health of Australian citizens and maintain the stability of the Australian economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that state and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health in their jurisdictions, which is based on the medical advice from their respective Chief Health Officers. The specific measures imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 in each state and territory, including managing the movement of freight within a state/territory, is the responsibility of the respective jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to bringing home Australians stranded overseas who wish to return, and has worked hard to ensure both their safety and that of the broader Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 8 January 2021, National Cabinet agreed to a range of measures to further mitigate the risk of emerging COVID-19 variants arising from international and domestic air travel. International passenger caps in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia will be temporarily halved from no later than 15 January 2021 to manage the flow of returning Australians and other travellers who have been potentially exposed to the new variants. Current international passenger caps in Victoria and South Australia and arrangements in the Northern Territory are considered manageable and will remain in place. The Government also introduced new measures to minimise the risk of importing COVID-19 via travellers. From 22 January 2021 all international travellers must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test before flying, and travellers must wear masks on all international and domestic flights and in domestic airports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government regularly reviews the emergency directions, including the international travel restrictions, to ensure their appropriateness in terms of global and local epidemiology. The Government is considering when and how to reopen our borders safely. However, this will be a step-by-step process underpinned by the latest medical advice and based on robust risk assessments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government, along with the states and territories, is taking an evidence-based approach to COVID-19, and is committed to keeping Australians safe.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning petition number EN1396, calling on the Australian Government to implement an immediate lockdown and strong social distancing measures. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note Australia's situation concerning the pandemic has changed significantly since the petition was initiated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is fortunate to have an excellent health system with strong capacity and capability to respond to health emergencies such as communicable disease outbreaks and pandemics. The Government took a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, based on the latest medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia. The relatively low number of COVID-19 cases in Australia is the result of the swift and successful implementation of public health measures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government, along with state and territory governments, has continued to pursue an 'aggressive suppression' approach in Australia. This means that Governments have taken all necessary measures to shut down community transmission where it occurs. This strategy is based on the public health actions of early identification of cases through widespread testing, isolation of cases, rapid contact tracing and quarantine of close contacts. It relies on the community adhering to necessary measures, such as widespread testing, practicing good hygiene, maintaining physical distancing and staying home and getting tested if unwell.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These emergency response arrangements are flexible and scalable, enabling my Department to take a tailored response to the evolving COVID-19 situation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As described in the National Health Security Agreement, state and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health in their respective jurisdictions. State and territory governments' actions are based on the medical advice from their respective Chief Health Officers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments' responsibility for on-the-ground measures has allowed an appropriate response adapted to each jurisdiction's local conditions and pandemic response stage. The specific measures imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 in each state and territory, enacted through respective jurisdictions' local public health and emergency legislation, includes quarantine and self-isolation, closing of non-essential businesses, and imposing requirements to wear Personal Protective Equipment (such as face masks).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I wish to mention that the Australian, state and territory governments are working together to coordinate an evidence-based response to COVID-19, based on the latest medical advice. Together these actions have placed us in a good position globally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All levels of government regularly review the impact of changes to determine the pace at which restrictions are relaxed and to enable a prompt response to any resurgence. The Government is committed to opening up in a COVIDSafe way, alongside strategies of widespread testing, isolation of cases, contact tracing and quarantining of people who are close contacts.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning petition number EN1398, calling on the Australian Government to introduce mandatory quarantine for all new arrivals, along with other mitigating strategies such as closing, universities and potentially more. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department is responsible for Australia's COVID-19 health response, as such the petition has been referred to me. I note Australia's situation concerning mandatory quarantine has changed substantially since the petition was initiated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government took a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, based on the latest and best medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Australia's strategy was based on the twin pillars of containment and capacity building. Our health emergency response measures were proportionate, scalable and tailored to the situation as it evolved. They included closing borders and implementing quarantine periods; testing and contact tracing; physical distancing; and enhanced hygiene practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government, along with state and territory governments, has continued to pursue an 'aggressive suppression' approach in Australia. This means that governments have taken all necessary measures, including introducing restrictions and closing borders, to shut down community transmission where it occurs. This has led to periods of elimination in parts of the country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The effective response to COVID-19 has been underpinned by strong governance; collaborative arrangements with the states and territories and other Government agencies; surveillance systems; public health laboratory testing capability; the National Medical Stockpile; Australian Medical Assistance Teams; investment in research; and border measures implemented under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our international travel restrictions control and manage the entry of COVID-19 in Australian territory and abroad. These travel measures also help lower the number of new cases to levels that can be effectively managed by our health and quarantine system. As part of Australia's strategy to combat the outbreak, hotel quarantine was mandated by the National Cabinet on 27 March 2020 and have proven to be highly successful—limiting the spread of COVID-19 to the Australian community when compared to many nations around the world.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN1416—Release an economic stimulus package. Your correspondence has been referred to me and I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that those in the travel and tourism industries were among the first affected by the COVID 19 pandemic, through the closure of international borders and domestic restrictions to keep Australians safe. The Government provided more than $20 billion in assistance to the tourism sector, including through JobKeeper, the Cash Flow Boost, and a number of targeted sectoral support programs. These included the $258 million Consumer Travel Support program for travel agents and tour operators, the $139.6 million Supporting Australia's Exhibiting Zoos and Aquariums program, and the $56 million Business Events Grants program. The Government's support helped preserve jobs in the tourism sector and put it in a position to take advantage of domestic and international tourists now that borders are reopening and restrictions have eased.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also partnered with state and territory governments to provide additional targeted support to tourism businesses in response to the most recent lockdowns. Measures included JobSaver in NSW, the Business Costs Assistance Program in Victoria, and the Tourism and Hospitality Sector Hardship Program in Queensland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The SME Recovery Loan Scheme is also supporting tourism businesses by increasing lenders' ability to provide cheaper credit, allowing many SMEs to access additional funding to get through the impact of COVID-19, recover and invest for the future. The Government announced on 13 December 2021 that it proposes to amend the Scheme Rules to extend the SME Recovery Loan Scheme to provide support to SMEs adversely economically affected by the pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the existing SME Recovery Loan Scheme, loans are available from 1 April 2021 until 31 December 2021 with a Government guarantee of 80 per cent. Under the proposed Scheme extension, loans will be available from 1 January 2022 until 30 June 2022, with a Government guarantee of 50 per cent. Further information, including a list of participating lenders, can be found at: www.treasury.gov.au/coronavirus/sme-recovery-loan-scheme</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 November, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment released for consultation a proposed strategy to rebuild and reimagine Australia's visitor economy. THRIVE 2030 (The Re-Imagined Visitor Economy) will be the national long-term plan for the sector's recovery and sustainable growth. The draft strategy sets the target of returning the industry to its pre-COVID levels of visitor expenditure by 2024 by diversifying markets, experiences and destinations, modernising supply side enablers, and collaborating across all stakeholders to achieve success. More information about the strategy is available at the following link: www.austrade.gov.au/news/publications/national-visitor-economy-strategy-thrive-2030-consultation-draft.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring the petition of 19 October 2020, calling for the end of the live animal export trade (Petition number: EN1696). I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention and apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes the welfare of all animals very seriously and understands its importance to the Australian community. It is important to note that the majority of livestock export voyages are undertaken without incident. Publicly available data indicates that more than 99 per cent of livestock exported from Australia arrive at their destination with good animal welfare outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's livestock export industry is strongly regulated. The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (the department) plays an important role in regulating the export of live animals and remains strongly committed to ensuring high welfare standards are maintained in this trade. The Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (ASEL) sets the minimum animal health and welfare requirements the livestock export industry must meet throughout the supply chain, from sourcing to completion of disembarkation overseas. For further information visit agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/live-animals/livestock/australian-standards-livestock.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When feeder and slaughter livestock arrive in an importing country, exporters must ensure they are handled and slaughtered in accordance with the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS). ESCAS is a set of regulatory conditions placed on exporters, requiring them to have arrangements in place with supply chain partners to ensure humane treatment and handling of livestock is provided from the time the animals arrive in the importing country up to and including the point of slaughter. Australia is the only country in the world with such a regulatory system in operation. Any non-compliance with ESCAS requirements is taken seriously by the department and fully investigated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The export of Australian livestock plays an important role in providing high quality nutrition to countries where inadequate infrastructure or consumer reluctance impede the growth of fresh meat imports. They also provide high quality breeding animals for those countries seeking to improve their self-sufficiency and economic growth through agricultural diversity. The live export trade generates significant income for the Australian economy and supports thousands of people employed across associated industries throughout rural and regional Australia. Whilst I appreciate the petitioner's view that live export should be banned, I am committed to facilitating continual improvement in the live export trade and supporting an economically and socially sustainable industry.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter to the former Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters, Senator the Hon Zed Seselja, dated 19 October 2020, referring to petition number EN1703. As the recently appointed Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters, I am responding to the Committee's request.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition, which requests an abolition of preference votes and the examination of the reimbursement of electoral expenditure to eligible political parties, candidates and Senate groups who receive four percent of the vote.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 1918, Australia has conducted full preferential voting in the House of Representatives in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span>. Preferential voting systems require a candidate to build a wider base of support from an electorate than rival candidates could achieve, as compared to the support they require under a first past-the-post method.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016, significant reform to Australia's Senate voting system occurred with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016</span>. This reform placed the control of preference allocation back into the hands of the voter. This amendment has given greater control to the voter by allowing the voter to select and preference the parties or candidates that best represent their interests. This system no longer facilitates the exchange of preferences between parties or candidates but leaves the voter in full control of determining which party or candidate will get their Senate vote.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 1984 there has been a Commonwealth reimbursement scheme funding electoral expenditure. With the intention to contribute to creating a more 'level playing field' and to reduce the potential for both real and perceived undue influence and corruption. In 2018 the <span style="font-style:italic;">Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Act 2018</span> was introduced and placed a cap on per-vote funding for elections to the amount spent by the party or candidate. The amendment limits public election funding to demonstrated electoral spending, without creating cash flow issues for smaller parties and independent candidates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Aged Care</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021concerning Petition EN2051 to legislate mandatory nurse staffing ratios in residential aged care facilities, amongst other reforms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is mindful of calls for staffing ratios, including for nurses, in residential aged care facilities. A proposed future funding model, the Australian National Aged Care Classification, is under development to potentially replace the current Aged Care Funding Instrument as an improved method of assessing the level and type of care required by residents. This is one of many reforms the Government is planning to assist providers to meet the community's high expectations of care for our senior Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Approved providers of aged care homes are required to meet the Aged Care Quality Standards (Standards) to ensure quality care and services are provided to all residents. In relation to staffing levels, this includes a requirement that aged care providers have a workforce that is sufficient, and is skilled and qualified to provide safe, respectful and quality care and services. Providers are expected to regularly review staffing levels and the mix of skills of their workforce, and adapt these to respond to the changing needs and situations of residents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2020-21Budget, the Government announced $10.8 million over five years to support and encourage more nurses to choose aged care as a clinical specialty. This funding has expanded the Australian College of Nursing scholarship program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also in the process of establishing an Aged Care Transition to Practice Program and a skills development program for nurses in aged care. With this funding, aged care nurses will have enhanced access to important training opportunities while also increasing the pool of nurses to care for our older Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the aged care complaints process, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Commission) assesses and monitors the performance of residential aged care homes against the Standards. Created by the Government in 2018, the Commission is more than just a hotline or a body to resolve complaints about services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through their engagement and education work, the Commission aims to build confidence and trust in aged care, empower consumers, support providers to comply with the Standards, and promote best practice service provision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Older Peron's Advocacy Network (OPAN) has been funded by the Government to deliver the National Aged Care Advocacy Program (NACAP) nationally since 2017. The NACAP provides free, independent and confidential advocacy support and information to older people (and their representatives) receiving or seeking to receive</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Government funded aged care services. Advocacy services ensure the needs of older people are supported and they are empowered to make informed decisions about their care. NACAP also educates Government-subsidised aged care service providers about advocacy and consumer rights.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Advocacy services ensure that consumers are placed at the centre of the process and the advocate acts at the consumer's direction. Older people and their representatives can connect with their local OPAN member organisation by calling 1800 700 600 between 6am -10pm 7 days a week or through OPAN's website at: www.opan.com.au/opan-network/. This includes the regular provision of face-to-face support to the individual and with families and service providers, within the OPAN office network locations. Some outreach services are provided within the scope of the current NACAP program. Further, advocates can support families in-person in cases of serious incidents in residential care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">OPAN organisations offer free education and information sessions to consumers and potential consumers of Commonwealth funded aged care services, and their families, carers or representatives. OPAN offers these education sessions to a range of consumers and settings, including:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, concerning petition EN2083 calling on the Australian Government to regulate the price of gluten free foods for Australians with gluten intolerance or coeliac disease. Your correspondence has been referred to me as Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services and Minister for Sport with portfolio responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate that adhering to a gluten free diet to manage conditions such as coeliac disease or gluten intolerance can be difficult for some Australians. However, the Australian Government is not currently considering adjusting the price of gluten free foods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Dietary Guidelines (Guidelines) provide evidence-based advice on the types and amounts of foods that Australians should eat for good health, meeting nutrient requirements, and the prevention of diet-related diseases (such as diabetes and heart disease).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Guidelines are not designed specifically for individual conditions such as coeliac disease or gluten intolerance, many of the foods recommended in the Guidelines in the five food groups are naturally gluten free. These foods are often more affordable than specialised gluten free substitutes. For example:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">rice and polenta are naturally gluten free foods within the 'Grain (cereal) Foods' food group and contain many of the same nutrients (such as vitamins minerals) associated with other grain foods</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 concerning Petition EN2204 calling on the House of Representatives to cease Australian Government funding to the state of Queensland for the 2032 Queensland Olympic and Paralympic Games (Games) bid.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring all Australians have an opportunity to participate in sport and physical activity. Sport improves the health and wellbeing of millions of Australians and brings communities together when our athletes take on the best in the world. Australia is experienced in hosting major sporting events, and we are proud of our track record of delivering spectacular events responsibly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is supporting South East Queensland's bid to host the 2032 Games, and has committed up to $10 million towards developing a compelling Australian Bid. Australia remains committed to sport and hosting major events such as the Games, and views this bid as an opportunity to engage all Australians in a common purpose to reinforce unity, enhance our performance and reputation in international sport, and come together to celebrate our enduring love of sport as a nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2019 Queensland Government's Value Proposition Assessment identified the Games would result in a positive economic return for Queensland, including job creation; supporting around 130,000 jobs directly and tens of thousands of jobs indirectly. The Games will also provide tourism and trade opportunities, including an estimated uplift of $20.2 billion in international visitor expenditure between 2020 and 2036, and increased export opportunities of up to $8.6 billion. More than 50 per cent of the international visitor expenditure ($10.1 billion) would also be expended in regional Queensland.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence on behalf of the signatories to the EN2222 petition concerning Home Care Package (HCP) funding. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is investing more in HCPs so that senior Australians can access the care they need to live in their own homes for longer, by reducing wait times for HCPs and connecting older Australians to essential care sooner. I am pleased to advise that the Government announced a record $6.5 billion for an additional 80,000 HCPs in the 2021-22 Budget. These HCPs commenced release in July 2021, with 40,000 being released in 2021-22 and a further 40,000 in 2022-23.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has now invested a record $11.9 billion in an additional 163,105 HCPs since the 2018-19 Budget, taking the total number of HCPs from 59,300 in 2011-12 to 275,597 in 2024-25. Overall, the Government's record investment in aged care has increased from $12.6 billion in 2011-12 to $24.6 billion in 2020-21.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For people in urgent need of care, assessed as a high priority, the Government's investment has enabled a significant reduction in wait times. Currently, people assessed as a high priority can access their approved level HCP within one month. Importantly, around 99 per cent of senior Australians waiting for a HCP at their assessed level also have been offered support from the Government, including an interim HCP or through the Commonwealth Home Support Programme, and they continue to have access to Australia's world-class health care system.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence on behalf of petitioners concerning access to hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan®) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) (petition number EN2235). I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2013, the Australian Government has approved more than 2,800 new or amended listings on the PBS. This represents an average of around 30 listings or amendments per month, or one each day, at an overall investment by the Government of $14 billion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a priority of the Government to provide all Australians access to safe, effective and affordable medicines. The Government has a policy to list all medicines on the PBS, following a recommendation to do so by the independent and expert Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). While the Government is responsible for listing medicines on the PBS, pharmaceutical companies that hold the relevant clinical evidence are responsible for applying to the PBAC for PBS subsidy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Buscopan® is available in a tablet and an injection form. Buscopan® injection is currently available on the PBS to treat palliative and repatriation patients. Further information about the PBS listing of Buscopan® injection and the specific criteria for PBS access is available on the PBS website at: www.pbs.gov.au/medicine/item/3473T-4279F-5317W. Buscopan® tablets are not subsidised through the PBS. Patients may be interested to know Buscopan® tablets are available in pack sizes of 10, 20 and 100. The packs of 10 and 20 tablets are available over the counter at pharmacies, while the 100-tablet pack requires a prescription from a prescriber.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To date, the PBAC has not received an application requesting listing of Buscopan® tablets from Sanofi-aventis Healthcare Pty Ltd (Sanofi-aventis), the pharmaceutical company responsible for Buscopan®. Patients may wish to contact Sanofi-aventis to ask whether it intends to request the PBS listing of Buscopan®. Sanofi-aventis can be contacted by telephone on 1800 640 791. Pharmaceutical companies are private entities that make their own decisions regarding their products and cannot be compelled by the Government to apply for PBS subsidy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As with all consumer goods, price competition applies to pharmacy and private (non-PBS) prescription medicines. Patients may wish to compare the prices of their medicines at different pharmacies to identify the best price.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 March 2021 enclosing Petition EN2360 concerning decreasing the amount of specified work required for second Working Holiday Maker (WHM) visa holders to become eligible for a third WHM visa. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The main purpose of the WHM Program is to build people-to-people and cultural links between Australia and partner countries. While WHMs can supplement their holiday with short-term employment, work is not the primary objective of the visa and WHMs are not required to work at all while in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the role of WHMs as an important source of labour, particularly in remote and regional Australia, but is also aware of concerns about the Program being used solely as a work visa or potentially displacing Australian workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While in Australia, WHMs are free to work in any industry, location and occupation they choose. They can also choose to undertake three and six months of 'specified work' in certain regions, industries and roles in order to qualify for a second and third visa. The current specified work arrangements have been set by the Government after extensive consultation, and aim to address identified skill shortages and maximise the benefit for specified regions and industries, while minimising the impact on local job opportunities for Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government appreciates that WHMs, and the role they play filling critical skills shortages across Australia, are important to Australia's economic recovery.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A range of changes to visa arrangements announced during 2020-21 have been made to ensure WHMs continue to support COVID-19 critical sectors of the economy. These measures will help with existing labour shortages and the recovery effort and include:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to explore further options for the WHM visa, noting that the Program is reviewed on a regular basis with stakeholder views taken into consideration.

              <span class="HPS-Small">In June 2020, the former Acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, asked the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) to inquire into and report on the WHM Program. The JSCM released its report on 30 November 2020 and this will inform future developments in the Program. The Government is considering all the recommendations and will provide a response to be tabled in Parliament.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 22 June 2021, I was pleased to announce that from March 2022, all WHM visa holders (both subclass 417 and subclass 462) will be able to count tourism and hospitality work carried out in Northern, remote and very remote areas of Australia as 'specified work' for the purpose of applying for a second or third WHM visa.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021, regarding a petition proposing a royal commission to investigate truck driver fatalities (Petition Ministerial Referral EN2410).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the desire for a royal commission to investigate the deaths of essential heavy vehicle drivers. While this serious issue would not fall within the parameters required for a royal commission, the Australian Government recognises and supports the role of our truck drivers as essential to the delivery of freight and goods across our country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The death of any heavy vehicle driver in the course of their employment is a tragedy. The Government is committed to reducing the number of heavy vehicle fatalities on our roads and ensuring our heavy vehicle drivers have a safe work environment that allows them to return home to their families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The primary purpose of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Road Safety Remuneration Act 2012</span> (the Act) was the establishment of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal (Tribunal). The decision to abolish the Act was informed by two independent reviews and extensive feedback received from industry participants. The independent reviews and industry consultation recommended the Tribunal be dismantled as there was no definitive link between safety outcomes and rates of remuneration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016, the Government redirected funds from the abolished Tribunal to the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator to deliver the Heavy Vehicle Safety Initiative (HVSI). The Government provides approximately $5.5 million each year for the HVSI, which funds heavy vehicle safety projects delivered across Australia. Projects have included the development of innovative heavy vehicle safety technologies, the delivery of driver training and the provision of wellbeing initiatives such as "Healthy Heads in Trucks and Sheds". To date, five HVSI rounds have provided more than $22 million across 89 grants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The HVSI is one of many programs the Government has in place to help ensure heavy vehicle drivers stay safe. Although the Act has ceased, the Government's investment in heavy vehicle safety is helping to reduce the number of heavy vehicle driver fatalities. Between 2016 and 2020, the number of fatalities involving heavy vehicles declined by a total of 10 per cent. I have attached further information on some of the Government's programs and investments.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to consider when and how to reopen our borders safely.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Although Australia has approved COVID-19 vaccines to prevent development of serious disease if an individual becomes infected, the vaccination program should not be viewed as a panacea or a complete substitute for other public health interventions.

              <span class="HPS-Small">There remains insufficient data as to whether the vaccines also prevent vaccinated individuals transmitting the virus to others. A person could be vaccinated but still be able to transmit. Until there is a better understanding of this, the purpose for rolling out vaccination in the short term is to protect individuals from developing disease. It should be assumed, until proven otherwise, that vaccinated individuals remain potentially infectious to others.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Paid Parental Leave Scheme</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 24 November 2021 to the Minister for Government Services and Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC, concerning petition number EN2516 regarding the Paid Parental Leave scheme. As the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your email was referred to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, Paid Parental Leave is fully funded through general taxation revenue. The Australian Government provides nearly $2.5 billion each year in support to families through Parental Leave Pay and Dad and Partner Pay. This is a non-contributory system, which means that all parents who are eligible for government-funded Paid Parental Leave can access this support when needed. In contrast, most OECD countries fund parental leave payments through contributory schemes or social insurance models. Under these schemes, only people who have paid contributions to a social insurance fund can access parental leave payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Parental Leave Pay has an income test to maintain fairness in the overall support provided to families with considerations of the cost of the scheme to taxpayers. To meet the income test for Parental Leave Pay, a claimant must have an individual adjusted taxable income that does not exceed the income limit in the financial year prior to the date of birth or adoption, or the date of claim, whichever is earlier. The income limit for the 2019-20 financial year was $150,000, and for the 2020-21 financial year it is $151,350.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As Parental Leave Pay is primarily designed to assist working women, the income test was designed so that the least number of women would be precluded from the scheme. As such, only the woman's income counts toward the income test, not the household income, so that working women will not be excluded from the scheme on the basis of their partner's income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The income test also recognises that women who are on a higher income, and are primary carers, are generally in a stronger position to obtain paid parental leave and other family-friendly benefits as part of their conditions of employment. The Government acknowledges that, unfortunately, this will not be the case for all families, and a small number of women will find they are unable to meet the income test.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to monitor the effect of its family assistance programs to ensure they are efficient, effective and appropriately targeted to give children the best start in life. The issues raised in Petition EN2516 will be considered in future reviews of paid parental leave arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence to Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC, Minister for Government Services, concerning Petition EN2668, which requests the listing of gender affirmation procedures on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). This matter has been referred to me as the Minister for Health. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians are able to access timely and affordable, high quality health care by providing Medicare rebates for services listed on the MBS and free hospital services for public patients in public hospitals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there is no specific MBS item for gender affirmation surgery, MBS rebates are available for patients to cover a range of surgical procedures and specialist consultations that may be performed as part of the gender affirmation process, if the services are deemed by the treating practitioner to be clinically relevant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a new medical procedure or treatment can be publicly funded on the MBS, an application would need to be assessed by the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC). MSAC is an independent, expert advisory group which provides advice to the Government on whether a new medical service or technology should be publicly funded, based on an assessment of the comparative safety, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, using the best available evidence. To date, no application has been submitted to MSAC to list specific gender affirmation surgery items on the MBS. More information about the MSAC process is available on the MSAC website at: www.msac.gov.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 August 2021 concerning a petition on the inspection and testing of imported foods. I note that this matter has been referred to me under Standing Order 209(a) and (b) of the Petitions Committee as it falls within my portfolio responsibilities as the Minister for Agriculture and Northern Australia. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is responsible for administering the <span style="font-style:italic;">Imported Food Control Act 1992</span> (the IFC Act). The IFC Act provides for the Imported Food Inspection Scheme (IFIS) that refers food at the border for inspection and testing to monitor that it complies with the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code) and does not pose a risk to public health and safety. The operation of the IFIS is set out in the Imported Food Control Regulations 2019 (the Regulations) which include the frequency of inspection and testing that can be applied to imported foods, based on how they are classified.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Imported foods are referred for inspection under the IFIS based on whether they are classified as risk, compliance agreement, or surveillance food and their history of compliance. Food is classified as risk based on advice from Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) that it has the potential to pose a medium or high risk to public health for a particular hazard or hazards and is scheduled in the Imported Food Control Order 2019. Foods that are imported under a compliance agreement are classified as compliance agreement food and are not referred to the IFIS, but rather the department audits the importer's food safety management system for compliance. All other foods are classified as surveillance food.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The regulations specify the frequency of inspection that can apply to imported food. Food classified as risk is referred for inspection and testing under the IFIS at a rate of 100 per cent of consignments. This rate of inspection is reduced to 25 per cent and then 5 per cent if consignments are compliant. Surveillance food is monitored at a rate of 5 per cent of consignments. If an imported food fails inspection subsequent imports (based on the product, producer and country of origin) they are referred under the IFIS at 100 per cent until a history of compliance is demonstrated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Imported food may be analysed for microbiological contaminants, natural toxicants, metal contaminants (such as tin, lead and arsenic), food additives and chemical contaminants (including pesticides) to check compliance with limits set in the Code. The tests applied change periodically based on the analytical data obtained over time and as new information becomes available. Information on the tests applied is provided on the department's website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to pesticides, a residue screen of around 108 chemicals is applied to imported fruit and vegetable products referred to the IFIS. Any failure is reported in monthly failing food reports available at awe.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/import/goods/food/inspection-compliance/failing-food-reports. Annual imported food inspection data reports are also published at awe.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/import/goods/food/inspection-compliance/inspection-data. Data for January to December 2020 shows a 97.9 per cent compliance rate for all food inspected during this period, including for pesticides and metal contaminants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the IFIS, all food available for sale within Australia is subject to the relevant state or territory food legislation and monitoring activities implemented by the relevant government authority within that jurisdiction. This includes the monitoring of food for residues of agricultural chemicals, heavy metals and other environmental contaminants.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN2714 on the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. Your correspondence has been referred to me for a response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands the importance of being able to buy your first home. The Government's Home Guarantee Scheme—comprising the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, the New Home Guarantee and the Family Home Guarantee—provide an accelerated pathway into home ownership for first home buyers and single parents with dependants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The New Home Guarantee was introduced to also support activity as part of the Government's economic response to the Covid-19 pandemic, helping to stimulate the economy and jobs in the residential construction sector. Given the need to support activity in the near term, the New Home Guarantee requires that a supported loan must enable construction to commence within a certain period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For any New Home Guarantees issued prior to 30 June 2021, the required start date for construction was 6 months from the date the construction contract was entered into. More recently, and in light of pressures on the availability of labour and materials in the construction industry, the Government has extended the requirement for reservations made after 1 July 2021 to 12 months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 August 2021 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, enclosing Petition EN2731 with 2,108 signatures, concerning extensions for the Temporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa holders stuck overseas. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I am the Minister responsible for the matter you have raised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the importance of Temporary Graduate visa holders and the contribution they make in Australia. The primary objective of the Temporary Graduate visa is to provide international students who have spent significant time studying in Australia with the opportunity to work, study and stay for a further period. In normal circumstances, applicants are limited to just one initial Temporary Graduate visa in a lifetime and a further visa is only available on the basis of regional work and study.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 November 2021, I jointly announced with the Minister for Education and Youth, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, visa holders who lost time in Australia due to COVID-19 international travel restrictions will be able to apply for a replacement visa. This includes people who were outside Australia at any time between 1 February 2020 and 1 December 2021, while they held a Temporary Graduate visa.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Fully-vaccinated Temporary Graduate visa holders outside Australia will be able to travel to Australia from 15 December 2021. Those graduates whose visas have expired will be able to apply for a replacement visa from 1 July 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There will also be other changes to Temporary Graduate visa settings to ensure Australia remains a competitive and attractive destination for international students:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the stay period on the Temporary Graduate visa for Masters by Coursework graduates, will increase permanently from two to three years, to match the stay period for Masters by Research graduates;</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">as a concession during the COVID-19 pandemic, the stay period on the Temporary Graduate visa, Graduate Work stream, will increase from 18 to 24 months, and application requirements will be streamlined by removing the requirement for graduates to nominate an occupation from the skills occupation list; and</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">these changes to Temporary Graduate visa stay periods will be implemented from 1 December 2021, and the removal of skilled occupation list requirements from 1 July 2022, for the duration of the 2022-23 financial year.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence to the Hon Karen Andrews MP, concerning petition number EN2751 requesting a cease on international flights and more support for Australians who wish to return from overseas. This matter has been referred to me as the Minister for Health and Aged Care. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has reopened its borders to vaccinated travellers as part of the Australian Government's step-by-step and safe reopening to the world, in line with the National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response (National Transition Plan). This is a result of the success Australia has achieved through the vaccine rollout.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As of 4 January 2022, more than 91 per cent of people in Australia aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine. All Australian jurisdictions now have an 84 per cent (or more) double dose vaccination rate for those aged 16 and over.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As we continue to implement the National Transition Plan, and subject to the latest medical advice, there will be a gradual reopening of inward and outward international travel. To support the next steps of reopening, proportionate testing, tracing, quarantine and isolation measures will be implemented within the Australian jurisdictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to monitor the latest international and domestic evidence and developments regarding the Omicron COVID-19 variant. Additional border measures that are in place, or have been in place, to protect Australians from Omicron are necessary, appropriate and proportionate to the risk presented by Omicron, and are considered consistent with actions being considered by other countries.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 August 2021 regarding House of Representatives Petition EN2760 requesting to backdate supports, similar to Centrelink, to National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) participants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS is an insurance-based scheme in which the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) makes evidence-based decisions on individuals' access. It is not considered a welfare system and is underpinned by the fundamental proposition that by taking a lifetime approach and investing in people early, the opportunity for individuals to live their best life is increased.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ensuring NDIS participants have the reasonable and necessary supports they require is a priority for the NDIA. As at 30 September 2021, approximately 484,700 participants are receiving supports from the NDIS, with approximately 13,600 children receiving initial supports through their NDIS Early Childhood partner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When identifying the types and amount of reasonable and necessary supports to provide, NDIA planners will review all information provided at the 'time of planning and make decisions based on the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013</span> and any relevant operational guidelines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When a support is approved, funding is included in a participant's NDIS plan. Supports can be claimed from the participant's NDIS plan start date. In most cases the NDIS does not reimburse or back pay for services provided to a participant, prior to funding being approved in a participant's plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIA helps participants or their nominee implement their plan and works with participants to ensure they continue to receive the disability-related supports they need. This may include support from a Local Area Coordinator who assist participants to find community activities and engage with mainstream services to help them pursue their goals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, if a participant's plan reaches its end date and their new plan hasn't been finalised yet, the current plan will be automatically extended for up to 12 months. This allows current funding to automatically continue for up to 12 months, or until the participant's new plan can be finalised. This is part of the NDIA's commitment to deliver a quality experience for NDIS participants and ensure there are no gaps in a participant's funding or supports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email referring petition EN2766 relating to the voting age in Australia. I am responding as the Special Minister of State and apologise for the delay in my response.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, it is important that the right to vote applies from an appropriate age, to ensure that electors can adequately understand parliamentary representation, enrolment and the electoral process. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span> provides that persons aged 16 years and over may enrol provisionally, ahead of becoming eligible to vote when they are 18 years of age. This is one way of encouraging people to start thinking about their future rights and responsibilities as voters, before they become qualified to vote.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Young people who have an interest in politics can also participate in public debates in various ways including by making submissions to parliamentary committees, such as the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, or by writing to members of Parliament. The Government also provides funding for a range of educational programs and resources, including the Museum of Australian Democracy, to help young Australians build their understanding of how Australia's system of government works.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 23 August 2021 concerning petition number EN2810 presented to the House of Representatives. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that Australians have access to timely and high-quality medical care no matter where they live. I share the frustration of practices in the Shoalhaven region of NSW which are experiencing difficulty recruiting suitable GPs. As a former gastroenterologist who spent most of my career practicing in regional and rural parts of Australia, I appreciate and understand the concerns of Australians living outside the major metropolitan areas of our capital cities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our greatest challenge is overcoming the significant maldistribution of the medical workforce so that all Australians can access the services they need, when and where they need them. It frustrates me that not enough young doctors are choosing to become GPs and of those that do enter general practice, many are picking the bright lights of our capital cities over practicing in regional and rural areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Minister for Regional Health, I am focused on improving the capacity, quality, and distribution of health services to meet the needs of families and communities. This involves significant investment and effort along the medical workforce pipeline from helping rural students study medicine through to the incentives provided to attract and retain doctors in the bush. This is not a challenge the federal government can do alone, and I am talking to my state health minister counterparts and the medical professional bodies about ways we can address the problem together.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Distribution Priority Area (DPA) indicator is used to identify distribution challenges in Australia's medical workforce. The DPA is an impartial mechanism which relies on the most recently available Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) demographic data (including age, gender and socio-economic status) as well as Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) billing data to assess levels of medical service provision throughout Australia. The DPA mechanism is intended to ensure that timely and high-quality GP services are available to Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas of the country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DPA mechanism uses the Modified Monash Model (MMM) geographical remoteness classification system to help determine where location restricted doctors should be distributed. Until recently, the DPA mechanism's automatic rules meant that MM 5-7 locations were automatically DPA. From 1 January 2022, the Government has expanded the DPA mechanism's automatic rules to include all MM 3 and MM 4 locations as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the Shoalhaven region, the towns of Nowra, Bomaderry and surrounding areas are classified MM 3. The towns of Huskisson, Vincentia, Sanctuary Point and Sussex Inlet to the south of Nowra are classified MM 4. From 1 January 2022, all of these areas are automatically classified DPA and exempt from service testing against benchmarks in the annual DPA update. This means that practices in these areas will now be able to recruit from a larger pool of doctors, including International Medical Graduates (IMG) subject to location restrictions under s19AB of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Health Insurance Act 1973</span>, as well as Australian-trained Bonded Medical Program (BMP) participants with return of service obligations. The Shoalhaven region will also be eligible for the non-Vocationally Registered Fellowship Support Program, the More Doctors for Rural Australia Program (MDRAP) and the Visas for GPs program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As Minister for Regional Health, I am confident that these changes to the DPA mechanism's automatic rules will prove highly beneficial to practices and doctors in the Shoalhaven region, and thereby help to improve the Shoalhaven community's access to timely and high-quality GP services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 10 December 2021 to the Attorney-General, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, enclosing Petition EN2825 with 15 signatures, concerning the Australian Government's approach to managing non-citizens who pose an unacceptable risk to the community through acts of violence and crime. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister responsible for the matter you have raised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ensuring the safety and good order of the Australian community is a key Government priority. In order to be granted a visa, all non-citizens must meet the character requirements set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span> (the Act) and the public interest criteria in the Migration Regulations 1994. Visa holders must continue to meet character requirements and abide by the conditions imposed on their visa while they remain in Australia. For instance, visa condition 8303 ("The holder must not become involved in activities disruptive to, or violence threatening harm to, the Australian community or a group within the Australian community") which is imposed on most temporary visas, provides the Minister with the power to cancel a visa if there is evidence of the visa holder engaging in activities that endanger or threaten the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visa cancellation powers in the Act enable the Government to respond to threats posed by individuals and organised crime groups or risks to the integrity of the migration program. Information on character requirements is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may also be interested to note that the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill was introduced to the Parliament on 24 November 2021 and is currently before the House of Representatives. When passed, these amendments, will ensure that non-citizens who are convicted of certain serious offences, including those of a violent or sexual nature, are appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation, regardless of the length of sentence imposed. The amendments will provide an objective basis for refusing or cancelling the visa of a non-citizen whose offending has not resulted in a sentence of 12 months or more, but who nonetheless poses an unacceptable risk to the safety of the Australian community.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition EN2832 requests the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004</span> be amended to include provisions consistent with certain provisions in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Act 1920 (Repealed)</span>. This would enable veterans to appeal questions of law arising from decisions of the Veterans' Review Board to the Federal Court of Australia, and either have their associated costs paid by the Commonwealth, or receive legal or financial assistance from the Attorney-General.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition EN2832 suggests that repealed sections 107VZZH, 107VZZJ, 107VZZK and 107VZZL of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Act 1920 (Repealed)</span> allowed for these Commonwealth-funded appeals, but they were not included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> when it repealed and replaced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Act 1920 (Repealed)</span>. In fact, these sections of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Act 1920 (Repealed)</span> were repealed by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Legislation Amendment Act 1984</span>, which commenced on 1 January 1985, before the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Act 1920 (Repealed)</span> was repealed in its entirety by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> commenced on 22 May 1986.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The changes were prompted by the Administrative Review Council Report to the Attorney-General on Review of Pension Decisions under Repatriation Legislation No. 20 (16 September 1983). The Administrative Review Council identified deficiencies in the system of primary decision making and review of decisions in place at that time, noting one of the problems with determining and reviewing decisions under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Act 1920 (Repealed)</span> was the "multiplicity of avenues of appeal", which resulted in substantial delays in disposing of claims, was both "unnecessary and wasteful of resources".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Administrative Review Council found decisions were not always adequately considered at either the primary or review stages of decision making, and the then Repatriation Review Tribunal was not able to fulfil its role adequately as a final review authority because of the number of cases it was called on to determine. The Administrative Review Council considered the system did not serve the best interests of veterans and their families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Administrative Review Council therefore recommended abolishing Repatriation Boards and making delegates of the Repatriation Commission responsible for primary decisions on service and disability pension claims and claims for pension increases, as well as reviewing decisions on primary claims for the service pension. The Administrative Review Council also recommended the Veterans' Review Board be established to replace the Repatriation Review Tribunal as the intermediate level of review of decisions of the Repatriation Commission on disability pensions. Finally, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would become the ultimate merits review body, due in part to the fact it was independent from the Repatriation Commission, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and ex-service organisations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In amending the legislation, the Australian Government essentially adopted this three-tiered framework for decision-making. It also made clear appeals to the Federal Court would be limited to questions of law arising from decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal only, in accordance with the provisions of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Administrative A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ppeals Tribunal Act 1975</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments therefore removed the previous mechanism allowing appeals directly from the Repatriation Review Tribunal to the Federal Court of Australia, Commonwealth-funded or otherwise. The then Minister for Veterans' Affairs commented it was believed many appeals would be resolved at the Veterans' Review Board by relatively expeditious, economical and informal means of review.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition EN2832 also suggests the provision in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Act 1920 (Repealed)</span> allowing for costs to be borne by the Commonwealth was included to: "balance out the fact that under EA s107VU [sic] Parliament had decided to deprive an applicant from representation by a legal practitioner at the review proceedings ... ".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It has long been the case parties to Veterans' Review Board proceedings, and before that the Repatriation Review Tribunal, could not be represented by legal practitioners. This remains the position. The intention of these provisions is not to deprive applicants of legal representation, but to ensure proceedings before the Veterans' Review Board are not adversarial, but inquisitorial. This is consistent with the three-tiered merits review framework outlined above.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Veterans may engage legal practitioners to act for them in proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is well-equipped to support self-represented applicants. The Repatriation Commissioner and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission as model litigants also have a duty to assist the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and self-represented applicants where appropriate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Subsection 357(2) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004</span> and subsection 67(8) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988</span> provide that if the Administrative Appeals Tribunal makes a decision favourable to the applicant, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may order the costs of those proceedings incurred by the applicant are to be paid by the Commonwealth, and subsections 357(3) and 67(8A) provide respectively the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may order the costs of the applicant in proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth be paid by the Commonwealth. Veterans who are successful in proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are therefore likely to have their legal costs paid by the Commonwealth.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN2834, individual tax residency rules. I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2021-22 Budget included a measure to modernise the individual tax residency rules by introducing a new framework that is easier to understand and apply in practice, provides greater certainty, and reduces compliance costs for globally mobile individuals and their employers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new framework will be based on the model recommended by the Board of Taxation in its 2019 report: <span style="font-style:italic;">Reforming Individual Tax Residency- a model for modernisation</span>. The Board's report recommended a simple 'bright line' test as the primary test: a person who is physically present in Australia for 183 days or more in any income year will be an Australian tax resident. Individuals who do not meet the primary test would be subject to secondary tests that depend on a combination of physical presence and measurable, objective criteria.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Board's report recommended that the secondary tests incorporate a test for individuals who were not residents in the preceding income year to determine whether they commence residency, and a test for individuals who were residents in the preceding income year to determine whether they cease residency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will consult on the new framework to ensure there are no unintended consequences. The measure will take effect from 1 July in the year after Royal Assent of the enabling legislation.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 23 August 2021 to the Minister for Agriculture and Northern Australia, the Hon David Littleproud MP, concerning Petition EN2846 to examine Genetically Modified (GM) crops. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, with portfolio responsibility for gene technology.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gene Technology Act 2000</span> (Act) has now been operational for over 20 years. Under this Act, the environmental release of all GM crops and other GM organisms (GMOs) in Australia must first be authorised by the Gene Technology Regulator (Regulator). Any proposal to release a GMO into the environment receives intense scrutiny by both the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) and the wider community'. The Regulator must not issue a licence authorising GMO dealings involving release to the environment unless satisfied that any risks posed by the GMO are able to be managed in a way that protects the health and safety of people and the environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The licensing system is centred on a rigorous process of risk assessment based on scientific evidence. The Regulator conducts a comprehensive and consultative process to decide whether or not to issue a licence to work with the GM crops. This comprehensive and consultative process is governed by the Act, the Gene Technology Regulations 2001 (Regulations), and corresponding state and territory law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The legislation requires the Regulator to prepare a risk assessment and risk management plan (RARMP) as part of the decision-making process on whether to issue or refuse to issue a licence. The Act also requires consultation with a wide range of experts, agencies and authorities, as well as the public. These include the Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee, state and territory governments, Australian Government agencies prescribed in the Regulations, the Environment Minister, and relevant local councils.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RARMP is finalised based on the advice received on the licence application and consultation with the above-mentioned experts, agencies, authorities and the public. The finalised RARMP and proposed licence conditions inform the Regulator's decision on whether to issue or refuse to issue a licence. If the Regulator does decide to issue a licence, the RARMP informs the conditions that apply to it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that the OGTR has monitoring powers to ensure compliance with licence conditions, and the Regulator has the power to vary, suspend or cancel licences if deemed necessary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, only three GM crops are grown commercially in Australia: cotton, canola and safflower. Other crops are undergoing field trials, subject to strict licencing conditions, to prevent spread and persistence of the GMO In the environment. The GM canola, cotton and safflower crops grown in Australia were approved for environmental release only after the Regulator found that they were as safe for human health and the environment as non-GM versions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Census of Population and Housing is the most comprehensive snapshot of Australia's people and housing and tells the story of how we are changing. The accuracy and quality of the data produced is dependent on ensuring the Census counts as many people and households as possible. The Census has a target response rate of over 95%.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABS always asks for willing cooperation, however if someone refuses to participate in the Census, the Australian Statistician may direct that person to complete a form through a formal written notice. If a person continues to refuse, they can be fined and get a criminal conviction. Only a very small number of people are fined for not completing the Census, however the knowledge that the Census is compulsory is important for ensuring high response rates and high-quality data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Census is an important opportunity for Australians to tell us about themselves and help make a difference for their community. Critical decisions are made by governments, businesses and local community groups that depend on knowing the age and sex of the population located in each part of Australia. Researchers are provided controlled access to Census data, including Census data integrated with other data, in a way that protects an individual's privacy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The data from the 2021 Census will be more important than ever as it will provide valuable insights into how the Covid 19 pandemic has changed life in Australia. The 2021 Census also has new questions on long-term health conditions and service with the Australian Defence Force. These are the first significant changes to the information collected in the Census since 2006 and will provide valuable information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">High quality Census data is also a critical component of the population estimates for each state and territory that the ABS produces every quarter. These population estimates are used for a number of important purposes including the setting of electoral boundaries and distribution of government funding.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring a copy of petition EN2947 presented to the House of Representatives on 18 October 2021, regarding the Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the importance of a safe, clean, and sustainable environment for the realisation of a range of existing human rights. However, the Government does not consider there is a universally accepted, standalone right to a safe, clean, and healthy environment under international human rights law (please refer to paragraph 1 of the Declaration).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although the Government is not able to sign the declaration, promoting international climate engagement by Australian youth is a priority for the Government. Australia signed the Kwon Gesh pledge at the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit, in which we committed to involving youth in our implementation of the Paris Agreement and the achievement of its goals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is advancing this agenda through the DFAT—Australian Youth for International Climate Engagement (AYFICE) Network Working Group, the Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) dialogue, and the development cooperation program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2020, DFAT established a working group with the AYFICE Network. This working group provides a formalised connection between Australian youth delegates who attend United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) events and the official Australian Delegation. The objective of the working group is to mainstream youth engagement through the Delegation's work and facilitate sharing of views, knowledge, and experiences.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In preparation for, and during, COP26 in Glasgow, DFAT engaged regularly with youth. On 12 October 2021, the Australian Ambassador for the Environment and Head of Delegation hosted a roundtable with 22 Australian youth climate leaders and participated in two public events hosted by the AYFICE Working Group. Seven youth delegates attended COP26 on Australian Party Overflow badges and have been in regular contact with the Australian delegation throughout the Conference.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia also supports the Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) workstream and its ability to enhance youth empowerment and voice. At COP26, Australia worked actively and constructively across groups to complete the review of the Doha Work Programme (DWP) (2012-2020) and define further actions to enhance implementation of ACE activities. We are pleased that Parties were able to agree the new Glasgow Work Programme and look forward to its implementation and defining further short-term actions at future sessions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Australian development cooperation program funds a range of partners to strengthen the capacity of youth to engage in climate change action. For example, through the Australian non-government organisation cooperation program (ANCP), Plan International Australia is empowering and equipping youth, especially adolescent girls, to lead climate resilient disaster preparedness actions in 59 communities across Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea. DFAT also provides core funding to UNICEF, which has an environment and climate change focus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We remain committed to engaging youth on climate change policy and supporting them to take action on climate change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning Petition No EN2961 seeking amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 </span>to enable expert medical evidence available to Courts pursuant to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evidence Act 1995</span> (Cth) to be used in conjunction with the factors in Statement of Principles to determine the relationship between a disease and the circumstances of service when deciding a compensation claim under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military Rehabilitation and Compensation A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ct 2004</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> was amended in 1994 to create the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Statement of Principles system—the Statements of Principles being legislative instruments which set out the factors connecting particular medical conditions, be they injuries or diseases, with the circumstances of military service. The system was introduced as lay tribunals and had significant difficulty dealing with conflicting medical opinions about whether the facts of service could cause a relevant disease or injury.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Statements of Principles are determined by the Repatriation Medical Authority which is a body of medical and epidemiological experts who are required to rely only on 'sound medical-scientific evidence' in formulating the factors. Sound medical-scientific evidence is defined in s5AB <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> and requires the Repatriation Medical Authority to rely on its expert medical knowledge and up to date epidemiological studies in determining the factors in the Statements of Principles for the causes of the various medical conditions. A review of the Repatriation Medical Authority conducted in 1997 confirmed that its decision making was 'generous' to claimants, while remaining within the bounds of scientific credibility.[1]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sections 120A and 1208 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> provide for the Statements of Principles to be the point of reference in assessing whether any hypothesis connecting a medical condition to service is reasonable or whether a decision-maker can be reasonably satisfied about the connection between a condition and service. Sections 338 and 339 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004</span> are to identical effect for all service on or after 1 July 2004. In order to succeed, a claimant merely has to establish the facts of service consistent with the cause outlined in the factors in the Statement of Principles for the particular medical condition. The claimant does not have to gather separate expert evidence to prove military service is linked with that medical condition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition seeks to have such expert medical evidence not provided to the Repatriation Medical Authority to be to be considered by the compensation decision-maker in conjunction with the factors in the Statement of Principles in deciding whether any hypothesis about the cause of a medical condition is reasonable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, any person, including a qualified medical expert, can submit an opinion with supporting sound medical-scientific evidence and the Repatriation Medical Authority as the expert medical body is obliged to consider it. The proposed change would have a non-expert compensation decision-maker being given the task of evaluating expert medical opinion about disease causation which could have been considered by the Repatriation Medical Authority as part of their investigation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition, as presented, refers to ordinary expert evidence admissible in a Court pursuant to s79 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evidence Act 1995</span> (Cth), and capable of being the subject of an expert certificate pursuant to s177 of that Act, being considered by the compensation decision-maker. It is suggested that this change would make the Repatriation Medical Authority's processes more consistent with "natural justice".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This however is to misunderstand the role of expert evidence in ordinary litigation. Section 79 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evidence Act 1995</span> does not require a Court to accept an opinion of a medical specialist given without supporting medical-scientific evidence that a particular exposure is a cause of a particular medical condition. The usual process in a curial setting includes an examination of whether the expert has a relevant expertise and whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on their specialised knowledge and then, what weight can be given to such evidence. The proposed change would require the compensation decision-maker to do likewise. This would require additional expert assistance and complicate and lengthen the evaluation of compensation claims.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It should be noted that the requirement for the Repatriation Medical Authority to focus on the up to date epidemiology is consistent with the developments in the Courts. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Amaca v Booth [2011] HCA 53</span> the High Court endorsed the use of epidemiological criteria in considering the causal connection between exposure to asbestos and the onset of mesothelioma. As Chief Justice French noted (44), these criteria which include matters such as the strength of an association, its biological plausibility and the dose-response relationship are not necessary conditions of a cause and effect relationship but have the character of circumstantial evidence of such a relationship. In this regard the Repatriation Medical Authority's process mirrors curial practice and is consistent with natural justice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current Statement of Principles system has wide support amongst the veteran community and its use is expanding. The Productivity Commission in its review of veterans' compensation, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Better Way to Support Veterans</span>, noted that support for that system and endorsed it as 'robust and effective' concluding that:-</span>

                </span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">"it promotes consistency, predictability and transparency and draws a clear line between accepted and non-accepted conditions, based on sound medical scientific evidence". [p.349]</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under an arrangement with the Australian Government, the Statements of Principles are now specifically referred to in the New Zealand <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Support Act 2014</span> and are used extensively by the Canadian Veterans Review and Appeal Board.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Statement of Principles system is also transparent with the reasoning of the Repatriation Medical Authority including all medical research being available to interested parties under s196I of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As well, the Statement of Principles are legislative instruments under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Legislation Act 2003</span> and required to be regularly reviewed lest they sunset and s196E of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> enables any veteran, member or ex-service organisation to request a review of a Statement of Principles to insert a new factor or vary an existing one.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is to the overall benefit of veterans and members of the Australian Defence Force that the Repatriation Medical Authority, as the expert medical science body, has the role of determining factors connecting the causes of injuries, diseases or deaths with military service. It provides an objective system based on the best evidence related to the causes of particular kinds of injuries, diseases and deaths and assists claimants in developing their claims for compensation.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your representation of 18 October 2021 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning petition number EN2992.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The strategic trends challenging Australia are accelerating, a reality laid out in the 2020 Defence Strategic Update. The Prime Minister has made clear that the Australian Government is committed to intensifying our efforts and cooperation with others to meet this complex new environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a substantial interest in the stability of the South China Sea and the norms and laws that govern it, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Australia has maintained its robust program of international engagement with countries in and around the South China Sea for decades. This includes unilateral, bilateral and multilateral activities as part of routine Australian Defence Force (ADF) deployments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our deployments to the region are consistent with the high priority the Government places on Indo-Pacific engagement, as reaffirmed by the 2020 Defence Strategic Update. They are demonstrations of our shared resolve for an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific and are valuable means for strengthening practical cooperation with regional partners and enhancing interoperability. ADF vessels and aircraft will continue to exercise rights under international law to freedom of navigation and overflight, including in the South China Sea and Australia will support others doing the same.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defending Australia, its people and its interests is the Government's highest priority. The Government's ability to deploy members of the ADF beyond Australia's territorial limits is an essential prerogative of the Executive exercisable under section 61 of the Constitution. Long-standing Westminster convention allows executive government to exercise the discretion to commit forces to operations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The exercise of constitutional power to deploy the ADF does not prevent the testing of Government decisions in the Parliament.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 October 2021 regarding Petition number EN3037.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the request put forward in this petition appears to be based on a misapprehension, albeit understandable, of the significance of the term 'statements of principles' as it is used in s138(2) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">'Statements of principles' is a term which now has a specific meaning within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Entitlements Act</span>, and refers to legislative instruments established by an independent statutory body, the Repatriation Medical Authority, which define the causal factors for conditions and which must be applied by decision-makers when making determinations accepting or refusing liability for medical conditions under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span>. Similar terminology was used in the context of the recommendations of external reviews which led to the foundation of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the commencement of the first Repatriation Medical Authority Statements of Principles in 1994.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The term 'statements of principles' described in Petition EN3037, was introduced in s138(2) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span> in order to set out a legislative basis for providing to the Veterans' Review Board non-binding guidance material on the causation of medical conditions pending the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority, is not accurate. The section which is the subject of the petition and the form of words used in s138(2) existed prior the commencement of the Repatriation Medical Authority Statements of Principles. This suggests the intended meaning of 'statements of principles' as used in s138(2) was and is unrelated to the specific and separate meaning which it now has under the legislative provisions setting out the power and functions of the Repatriation Medical Authority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 138(2)(a) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span> itself specifies the Repatriation Commission may furnish 'statements of principles' applied by the Commission in deciding claims for pension, applications for pension, attendant allowance, increased pension and in conducting reviews under s31 <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span>. The Statements of Principles now administered by the Repatriation Medical Authority have only one purpose—the determination of whether a claimed condition is caused by service. They have no role in claims for increase in pension or attendant allowance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The term 'statements of principles' as it appears in s138(2) has its origins in the amendments made to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Act 1920</span>. For example, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Repatriation Acts Amendment Act 1979</span> used the term 'statements of principles' to describe principles derived by the Commission from decisions of the then Repatriation Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Given the very similar terminology and context to which the term applied under earlier legislation since the 1970s, it is a reasonable conclusion the provisions which now exist in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span> were modelled on those in the earlier legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As such, the use of the term 'statements of principles' long predated, and is clearly distinct from its application, as a proper noun, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' En</span><span style="font-style:italic;">titlements Act</span> to the instruments administered by the Repatriation Medical Authority. As it is used in s138(2) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span>, the term clearly refers more broadly to policy and procedural guidance material provided to decision makers to assist them in exercising their relevant functions under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This interpretation is borne out by the Explanatory Memorandum to the Veterans' Entitlements Bill 1985, which states, in relation to clause 137 (which corresponds to what is now <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act</span> s138), the "combined effect of sub-clauses 137(2) and (3) will be that the Commission may make available to the Board material which may aid in encouraging consistency in decision making but will not be able to direct the Board in the consideration of a particular review." This indicates the intention of this provision was to enable the Repatriation Commission to furnish the Veterans' Review Board with the guidance material used in deciding certain claims, while also making clear this material would not bind the Board.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this light, I am informed the removal of these provisions would not have the effect presumed by the Petition EN3037. Such action may in fact have a negative impact, in that the ability of the Repatriation Commission to provide its policy and procedural material to the Board may be restricted. This could result in the Board not being able to form a clear understanding of how the Commission arrived at a decision in a particular case, slowing the review process and conceivably increasing the risk of adverse or inconsistent outcomes for veterans. Therefore, there are no plans to repeal this provision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns set out in Petition number EN3037 to my attention. I trust this· information is of assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3042 on Indigenous funding and the Indigenous Voice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Indigenous Australians have lived and cared for the land and seas across Australia for over 60,000 years and hold a unique and enduring place in our nation's story.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Indigenous Australians are also amongst the most disadvantaged communities in our nation. The Australian Government is committed to work with Indigenous Australians in partnership and shared decision-making to address this disadvantage, including through the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, and the Indigenous Advancement Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to an Indigenous Voice, I acknowledge there are many views, approaches and ideas on an Indigenous Voice. The overarching purpose of an Indigenous Voice is to ensure that Indigenous Australians are able to have their say about laws, policies and services that impact them. It is only fair that where governments discuss and adopt policies specifically related to Indigenous Australians, they have a say on this. As a result we will benefit from better decisions, programs and policies that reflect a broader, richer and more diverse· Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">That is why the Morrison Government considered it important to commission a co-design process with extensive consultation to ensure that the views of all Australians were considered on this issue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2021, the Morrison Government released the <span style="font-style:italic;">Indigenous Voice Co-design Final R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport to the Australian Government</span>. The Report is the result of a robust 18-month co-design process to develop proposals for an Indigenous Voice. Co-design groups made up of 52 members from around the country, primarily Indigenous people, led this process and over 9,400 people have had their say on the proposals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Final Report recommends establishing Local &amp; Regional Voices as the first step. Strong local and regional arrangements will build a foundation for legitimacy at the community level as well as helping to ensure sustainability and long-term success. The report made it very clear that for Local &amp; Regional Voices to be successful, they must speak to all levels of government—federal, state and local.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is why the Morrison Government will now commence discussions with states, territories and local governments to encourage their participation in the 35 Local &amp; Regional Voices to be established nationally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government will also continue the co-design approach during implementation and will work with the other levels of government to set up a Local &amp; Regional Voice Establishment Group to work with governments and other stakeholders to progress this historic initiative. You can access the Final Report online at voice.niaa.gov.au.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that the period following the birth of a child can be a challenging time, and remains committed to helping parents balance their work and family responsibilities through a range of programs and payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, Paid Parental Leave is fully funded through general taxation revenue. The Australian Government provides nearly $2.5 billion each year in support to families through Parental Leave Pay and Dad and Partner Pay. This is a non-contributory system, which means that all parents who are eligible for government-funded Paid Parental Leave can access this support when needed. In contrast, most OECD countries fund parental leave payments through contributory schemes or social insurance models. Under these schemes, only people who have paid contributions to a social insurance fund can access parental leave payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Parental Leave Pay is intended to complement employer-provided leave entitlements. The Paid Parental Leave scheme also currently allows a primary carer to remain eligible for Parental Leave Pay if they return to work during the period their child remains in hospital, if the child is required to remain in hospital or is hospitalised immediately after birth. This is particularly helpful for families with a child born prematurely, allowing them to return to work and delay their Parental Leave Pay until the child has been discharged from hospital. More information on the Parental Leave Pay return to work and keeping in touch provisions can be found at:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021, concerning petition EN3104, which asks for action to deliver the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine candidate to the Australian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safety of the Australian population has always been the highest priority of the Australian Government. For this reason, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. With rolling submission, collaboration with international regulators, and proactively working with sponsors, the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines including Novavax is being significantly expedited without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy. In January 2021, the TGA granted provisional determination to Novavax. The next step in the approval process is for the sponsor to submit an application for provisional registration in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This submission includes a comprehensive dossier that includes specific information on clinical studies, non-clinical/toxicology studies, chemistry, manufacturing, risk-management, and other information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Novavax submitted initial data in February 2021 and, as part of the company's rolling submission, provided its initial quality data tranche in November 2021. The TGA is currently evaluating this data and is in the process of obtaining further information and clarification from the sponsor as the evaluation progresses, as well as being informed by the advice of the Advisory Committee on Vaccines, an independent committee of external experts. More information on these evaluations can be found on the TGA website at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines-undergoing-evaluation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has invested in a diverse portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines that use a variety of technical platforms, entering into five separate Advance Purchase Agreements for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines, if they prove to be safe and effective. These include agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Moderna and the international COVAX. Combined, these agreements will ensure Australia has access to more than 280 million vaccine doses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>

                <span style="&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xA;  ">
                </span>The TGA is open and transparent about safety information relating to COVID-19 vaccines, including any suspected side effects or potential safety issues. The TGA publishes a weekly safety report, including information about reported suspected side-effects, as well as other safety alerts as required.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 enclosing petition EN3159 with 525 signatures, concerning the situation in Afghanistan. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan citizens are a prominent caseload in Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program and have been in the top five countries of origin over the last five years. The Australian Government announced on 18 August 2021 that Afghan citizens will be prioritised for processing within the offshore Humanitarian Program. An initial 3,000 humanitarian places have been allocated to Afghan nationals within Australia's 13,750 annual program. Particular priority will be given to persecuted minorities, women and children, and those who have close links to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government anticipates this initial allocation will increase further over the course of 2021-22. We are working with Afghan community leaders here in Australia, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to identify and resettle those Afghan refugees most in need. One 25 August 2021, the Government established on 25 August 2021 an Advisory Panel on Australia's Resettlement of Afghan Nationals to provide advice and support to the Government and the Department of Home Affairs to ensure that that resettlement planning, service provision, and goodwill across communities is harnessed for the Afghan cohort.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is focussed on ensuring that the Australian response, including further consideration of Humanitarian Program settings, is well considered and meets the needs and priorities of the Afghan community. The Government will make further announcements on the composition and priorities in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the importance of family reunion for refugees and humanitarian entrants. A key aim of Australia's Humanitarian Program is to reunite refugees and people who are in refugee-like situations overseas with their family in Australia through 'split family' provisions and the Special Humanitarian Program. Immediate family of people who have been resettled under the Humanitarian Program are given highest priority in processing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals who arrive lawfully in Australia seeking asylum, who are found to engage Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement</span> (non-return) obligations may be granted permanent protection, subject to fulfilling relevant visa criteria and the health, character and security requirements that apply to all Australian visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Unlawful arrivals who engage Australia's protection obligations are only eligible for temporary protection, that is, either a Temporary Protection visa (TPV) valid for three years or a Safe Haven Enterprise visa (SHEV) valid for five years. TPV holders are not eligible to propose relatives through the Humanitarian Program. This is in line with the Government's Operation Sovereign Borders policy that no one who comes to Australia illegally by boat will settle here—established to safeguard vulnerable people from exploitation by people smugglers, prevent the loss of life at sea, and ensure the integrity of Australia's borders. These settings have successfully stemmed the flow of people smuggling ventures to Australia and saved countless lives at sea.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the Humanitarian Program, the Government operates a Migration Program for people who wish to migrate on the basis of their skills or family relationships in Australia. Further information on this Program is available on the Department of Home Affair's website at: https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visa processing times can vary according to the particular circumstances of the applicant, their location (be it inside or outside their home country), and their ability to travel, provide documents or access Australian government officials. We know this is a distressing time for many people, including our Australian Afghan community, and request patience with the application process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to Afghan nationals who were granted a Humanitarian Stay (Temporary) (subclass 449) visa, these visas were granted due to the rapidly changing security circumstances in Afghanistan, the urgent and exceptional humanitarian nature of the evacuation operation and the limited window for people to depart Afghanistan. We made every effort we could to get everyone out, with the top priority being to evacuate Australians, visa holders and former locally engaged employees. Following the formal evacuation phase, Australia has continued to facilitate, where possible, the ad hoc movement of smaller number of Afghan nationals, including subclass 449 visa holders who have fled Afghanistan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For those subclass 449 visa holders in Australia, on 12 November 2021 the Government announced changes to the migration legislation to support Afghan nationals recently evacuated from Afghanistan to undertake permanent visa processes in Australia. These changes support the evacuees through permanent visa processes through the provision of a 12 month extension of their temporary subclass 449 visas. During this time they will also retain access to Commonwealth settlement, health, welfare and income supports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes also provide a clear pathway to permanent residence for those Afghan evacuees located in Australia on subclass 449 visas—either continuing on their existing migration visa pathways, or through the Humanitarian Program. These changes allows Afghan subclass 449 visa holders in Australia to make a valid application for a Refugee and Humanitarian (Class XB) visa in Australia. This change aligns to a practicable extent, visa outcomes for this group with what they would likely have been eligible through the Humanitarian Program, if they did not need urgent evacuation from Afghanistan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, on 18 November 2021, the Government announced that the subclass 449 visas granted to Afghans who supported Australia's mission in Afghanistan and their families, who have not yet arrived in Australia, will be extended on an ongoing basis. This includes subclass 449 holders who are:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Those outside the LEE program who were granted a subclass 449 visa, which will expire, are to receive priority in Australia's Humanitarian and Refugee intake.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government is working to ensure that visa options continue to be available to Afghan nationals, both within Afghanistan and those who have been displaced from their home country. All visa applications will be processed in accordance with Government announcements and within program priorities, and assessed on an individual basis. All visa applicants must also meet visa criteria and satisfy public interest criteria for character, security and health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For those remaining in Afghanistan, the situation remains highly volatile, and travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous. Some borders are closed or may close without notice (as outlined in Smartraveller advice). We urge all people remaining in Afghanistan to prioritise their safety and carefully consider the risks should they attempt to leave by any route.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan Australians are an integral part of Australian society and the Australian community. The Government is endeavouring to do all we can to continue to assist those affected through our ongoing humanitarian, whole-of-government and collaborative efforts.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 October 2021 to the Treasurer, the Hon Josh Frydenberg MP, regarding petition EN3206 calling on the amount of the COVID-19 Disaster Payment to be raised and for the payment to be extended to the end of January 2022. As this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your correspondence has been referred to me for a response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has ensured support is available for people affected by the public health response to COVID-19. As at the 2021-22 Budget, the Australian Government had committed $311 billion, or about 15.7 per cent of 2019-20 GDP, in direct economic and health support to Australian households and businesses since the onset of the pandemic. The Australian Government continues to provide direct economic support to Australian households and businesses impacted by the recent COVID-19 outbreaks with over $11.7 billion (as at 29 October 2021) paid in business support. Since it was introduced in mid-2021, the COVID-19 Disaster Payment has supported over 2 million people, to a total of over $12.5 billion (as at 29 October 2021).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the National Plan, the Government announced that as vaccination rates increase, there is an expectation lockdowns and movement restrictions will ease. As states and territories reach 70 per cent and 80 per cent full vaccination of their population 16 years or older, more people are able to go back to work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When a state or territory reaches the 80 per cent vaccination target, the payment will decrease over a two week period before it stops and is no longer available in that jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People whose income is still affected after this period or have lost their job entirely, may be able to access other support such as JobSeeker Payment, and should test their eligibility through the Services Australia website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention and I trust this is of assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021, enclosing Petition EN3212, with 123 signatures, concerning the operation of the SkillSelect system and the Expressions of Interest (EOI) that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Home Affairs is closely monitoring migration and visa settings to ensure they are consistent with public health measures, are flexible and do not displace job opportunities for Australians, so that Australia can effectively respond to the immediate and subsequent impacts of COVID-19. Targeted invitation rounds have occurred in SkillSelect since May 2020 for Skilled Independent (subclass 189) visas. The number of invitations issued each round is also impacted by Migration planning levels and the number of on-hand applications for this visa. For the 2021-22 Program Year planning levels for this visa are 6,500 places.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given the number of places available in this program are limited, not all intending migrants with an EOI points score will be issued an invitation to apply. Extending the validity of an EOI, beyond the two year period, may result in applicants failing the requirements to be granted a visa. It is open to applicants to submit a new EOI, with updated information, should they still wish to be considered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The EOI process is a key component of the Skilled Migration Program and is used to enable skilled workers or business persons from overseas to express their interest in migrating to Australia. Applicants submit their EOI through the SkillSelect system. An EOI is not a visa application and there is no fee to create or submit an EOI in SkillSelect. Once an EOI has been completed and submitted, it is stored in SkillSelect and is valid for two years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Points Tested Skilled Visas require the applicant to undertake skills and English assessments which must be valid at the time an invitation is made. SkillSelect is a dynamic system, which updates an applicant's score throughout the lifetime of an EOI based on information provided in the EOI. SkillSelect ranks intending migrants on their notional points score which SkillSelect determines using criteria in Schedule 6D of the Migration Regulations. An applicant can update their EOI information at any time until they are invited, and should do so if their circumstances change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Invitations for Skilled Independent (subclass 189) visas are issued from SkillSelect via an automated process and use the ranking system of the highest points score followed by the earliest 'Date of Effect'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Once invited to apply for a visa, the intending migrant has 60 calendar days to lodge an application for the visa specified in the invitation. The validity period of an invitation cannot be extended.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Applicants who have not received an invitation for a Skilled Independent visa may wish to explore alternative options, such as submitting an EOI for a state and territory Nominated visas (such as the Skilled Nominated (subclass 190) visa) which are invited under a different process from that outlined above. SkillSelect candidates for Skilled Nominated visas are not issued a direct invitation via SkillSelect. Rather, relevant state and territory government agencies can view EOIs in SkillSelect and decide whether to nominate them for a visa. When a state and territory government agency nominates in SkillSelect, it triggers an invitation to be issued.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Applicants may also choose to contact a state and territory government agency to discuss their nomination process and requirements, and request possible consideration for nomination.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3233 requesting legislation against mandatory COVID-19 vaccination passports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders which require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees or needs careful consideration, taking into account the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government understands that some businesses are considering whether to require vaccination as a condition of service or entry. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises. However, anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there are exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a prescription medicine (including a COVID-19 vaccine) can be legally supplied in Australia, it must be approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and it will be subject to well-established and rigorous assessment and approval process of the TGA to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of all vaccines approved for use in Australia and has robust procedures in place to investigate any potential new safety issues. The TGA's vaccine safety monitoring system can rapidly detect, investigate and respond to any emerging safety issues identified for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is following the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Australia. The ATAGI have published clinical guidance on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Australia, which is available to view at: www.health.gov.au using the search terms 'ATAGI Clinical Guidance'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The exact mechanism leading to TTS is not yet fully understood, but is thought to be immune-mediated, involving antibodies against platelet factor 4. However, based on what we currently know, there is little evidence to suggest TTS is caused by accidental intravascular administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021 enclosing Petition EN3250 with 282 signatures, concerning the <span style="font-style:italic;">Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Act 2021</span> (the Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act forms part of the Australian Government's response to the challenges posed by the increasing use of the dark web and anonymising technologies, which allows criminals, including terrorists and other malicious actors to hide from law enforcement. This has made committing serious crimes at volume and across borders easier than ever before.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act provides the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) with new powers to identify and disrupt serious criminal activities online. Data disruption warrants enable the AFP and the ACIC to frustrate the commission of serious offences online by modifying, adding or deleting data. Network activity warrants enable the AFP and ACIC to collect intelligence on serious criminal activity carried out by criminal networks online. Account takeover warrants allow the AFP and ACIC to take control of a person's online account to gather evidence about criminal activity.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The powers authorised under a warrant cannot be used for unauthorised purposes. It does not permit the AFP or the ACIC to engage in criminal activity on behalf of other persons. Each of these warrants are issued by an independent issuing authority and must relate to an offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment of three years or more. Before a warrant can be issued, the issuing authority must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds founding the application for the warrant and have regard to certain matters, including the nature and gravity of the conduct constituting the offence, privacy and the impact on innocent third parties.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The powers are accompanied by strong safeguards which protect the privacy of Australians and ensures that the powers are used only where necessary, proportionate and reasonable. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman will oversee the AFP and ACIC's use of these powers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These new powers are highly targeted, only able to be obtained in relation to the investigation of serious criminal offences and only once an independent issuing authority is satisfied all relevant criteria are met. The strong safeguards that form part of these powers ensure they will be used appropriately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has designed these new laws very carefully to ensure the Act strikes the appropriate balance between respecting individual privacy and the rule of law on which our democracy is based, while still giving our Australian law enforcement agencies the vital powers they need to keep the community safe.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3260, calling on the Australian Government to introduce, or import, China's COVID-19 vaccines as soon as possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. Moreover, the safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia. All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk-management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), Moderna and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines have been provisionally approved after a complete assessment of all the available data and the Novavax vaccine is currently under evaluation. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna vaccines have subsequently been used in Australia's national vaccine rollout, while the Janssen vaccine has not been utilised, though it is provisionally approved.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This approval process is the same process as any vaccine approved in this country. The TGA will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. No part of the process has been rushed, and there was no emergency authorisation granted as the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The urgency of the global pandemic means that researchers, agencies such as the World Health Organization and governments all over the world are prioritising the development, assessment, and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA requires robust scientific data before supporting a vaccine candidate and will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is found to be safe and effective, following its complete assessment of data. Information concerning COVID-19 vaccines under evaluation can be found at: </span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With rolling submission, collaboration with international regulators, and proactively working with sponsors, the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines including Novavax is being significantly expedited without compromising on our strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy. However, the timeframe will ultimately depend on when the complete data package is provided by sponsors to enable the required regulatory processes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts, globally. There are more than 400 trials for 140 vaccine candidates worldwide, including a number that are trialling the use of needle-free technology. These include nasal sprays, oral tablets, skin patches and jet injectors.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Future investments in COVID-19 vaccine candidates and manufacturing options are subject to the advice of the COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments for Australia—Science and Industry Technical Advisory Group, and assessment of clinical evidence, including portfolio diversification and risk.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: International Travel</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, enclosing Petition number EN3262 with 314 signatures, concerning travel exemptions for immediate family members (spouse and/or dependent children) of international Student visa holders to travel to Australia. Your correspondence was referred to me on 24 November 2021 as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's current travel restriction policy has played a foundational role underpinning management of COVID-19's impact on public health in Australia and was implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be aware that on 6 August 2021, the National Cabinet agreed in full to a four-phase National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response. The National Transition Plan provides a graduated pathway to reopen the international border with each phase triggered once Australia reaches key vaccination thresholds expressed as a percentage of the population who are vaccinated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the National Plan, on 22 November 2021 the Australian Government announced that from 1 December 2021, fully-vaccinated eligible visa holders including those holding a Student visa, either primary, or as a dependent based on the relationship with the onshore student as a spouse or dependent child, will be exempt from the travel restrictions for travel to Australia. However, based on caution, whilst more is learnt about the nature and impact of the Omicron variant of concern, on 29 November 2021, the Government announced a temporary pause to safely reopen Australia to fully-vaccinated eligible visa holders from 1 December 2021 until 15 December 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Immediate family members of those international students in Australia, who hold a Student visa, listed as an eligible visa under these new arrangements will now be able to avail themselves of the 'vaccination advantage' for travel without the need to apply for an exemption after 15 December 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A full list of eligible visa subclasses and information on how to access this arrangement is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/vaccinated-travellers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN3262 to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Law Enforcement</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021 enclosing Petition EN3289 with 253 signatures, concerning the <span style="font-style:italic;">Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Act 2021</span> (the Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act forms part of the Australian Government's response to the challenges posed by the increasing use of the dark web and anonymising technologies, which allows criminals, including terrorists and other malicious actors to hide from law enforcement. This has made committing serious crimes at volume and across borders easier than ever before.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act provides the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) with new powers to identify and disrupt serious criminal activities online. Data disruption warrants enable the AFP and the ACIC to frustrate the commission of serious offences online by modifying, adding or deleting data. Network activity warrants enable the AFP and ACIC to collect intelligence on serious criminal activity carried out by criminal networks online. Account takeover warrants allow the AFP and ACIC to take control of a person's online account to gather evidence about criminal activity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each of these warrants are issued by an independent issuing authority and must relate to an offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment of three years or more. Before a warrant can be issued, the issuing authority must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds founding the application for the warrant and have regard to certain matters, including the nature and gravity of the conduct constituting the offence, privacy and the impact on innocent third parties.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The powers are accompanied by strong safeguards which protect the privacy of Australians and ensures that the powers are used only where necessary, proportionate and reasonable. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman oversee the AFP and ACIC's use of these powers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The operation, effectiveness and implications of these powers will be subject to review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These new powers are highly targeted, only able to be obtained in relation to the investigation of serious criminal offences and only once an independent issuing authority is satisfied all relevant criteria are met. The strong safeguards that form part of these powers ensure they will be used appropriately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has designed these new laws very carefully to ensure the Act strikes the appropriate balance between respecting individual privacy and the rule of law on which our democracy is based, while still giving our Australian law enforcement agencies the vital powers they need to keep the community safe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN3289 to my attention. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3305 to fast-track the approval and supply of the Novavax vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing all Australians with access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines as soon as available. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. With rolling submission, collaboration with international regulators, and proactively working with sponsors, the evaluation of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is being significantly expedited without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy. The Novavax vaccine has been granted provisional determination by the TGA and is currently under evaluation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The next step in the approval process is for the sponsor to submit an application for provisional registration in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This submission includes a comprehensive dossier that includes specific information on clinical studies, non-clinical/toxicology studies, chemistry, manufacturing, risk-management, and other information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Novavax submitted initial data in February 2021, and, as part of the company's rolling submission, provided its initial quality data tranche in November 2021. The TGA is currently evaluating this data and is in the process of obtaining further information and clarification from the sponsor as the evaluation progresses, as well as being informed by the advice of the Advisory Committee on Vaccines-an independent committee of external experts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real-world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts, globally. The nature of these discussions is commercial-in-confidence but considers the likely timing of supply, cost and recommendations from Government medical experts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 23 November 2021 concerning petition EN3307 requesting that gender affirming and gender reassignment services be eligible for Medicare benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the many challenges faced by transgender people and those who have gender dysphoria. The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians are able to access timely and affordable, high quality health care by providing Medicare rebates for services listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and free hospital services for public patients in public hospitals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there is no specific MBS item for gender affirmation surgery, MBS rebates are available for patients to cover a range of surgical procedures and specialist consultations that may be performed as part of the gender affirmation process, if the services are deemed by the treating practitioner to be clinically relevant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a new medical procedure or treatment can be publicly funded on the MBS, an application would need to be assessed by the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC). MSAC is an independent, expert advisory group which provides advice to the Government on whether a new medical service or technology should be publicly funded, based on an assessment of the comparative safety, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, using the best available evidence. To date, no application has been submitted to MSAC to list specific gender affirmation surgery items on the MBS. More information about the MSAC process is available on the MSAC website at: www.msac.gov.au.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3310, requesting legislation against mandatory COVID-19 vaccination passports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders which require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees needs careful consideration, taking into account the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government understands that some businesses are considering whether to require vaccination as a condition of service or entry. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises. However, anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there are exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3313—Freedom of Vaccine Choice in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe and free COVID-19 vaccine if they choose to be vaccinated. Moreover, the safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) formally assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines, including vaccines, prior to their approval for use in Australia. All vaccines must pass the TGA's rigorous assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials and test for safety at every phase, as well as the vaccine's efficacy at protecting against infection and disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This involves comprehensive review of clinical trial data, non-clinical and toxicological studies, chemistry, manufacturing, quality, risk management and other information by a large team of clinical and scientific experts. Advice is then sought from an independent expert committee before a regulatory decision is made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All COVID-19 vaccines used in the rollout have been granted provisional approval following a complete assessment of all this available data. No part of the process has been rushed, and the TGA does not have an 'Emergency Use Authorisation' pathway for COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The urgency of the global pandemic means that researchers and agencies such as the World Health Organization, and governments all over the world, are prioritising the development, assessment and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a combination of reasons why safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been able to be designed, researched and made available sooner than previously seen. For example:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Unprecedented levels of funding—the pandemic is a global priority and governments around the world are investing in research and manufacturing facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Technology—the evolution of technology has allowed vaccines to be developed at a faster pace than in the past. New technologies have helped scientists understand the coronavirus and its make-up more easily, which has allowed them to start working on vaccine design more quickly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Combined clinical trials—in response to the pandemic, some pharmaceutical companies have combined clinical trial phases 1 and 2.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Expedited review process by regulatory agencies—the TGA is engaging early with pharmaceutical companies about their vaccines and is accepting rolling data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that the TGA can accept, review and assess clinical trial data as it becomes available, rather than all at once at the end of the three clinical trial phases. The TGA will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. With rolling submission, collaboration with international regulators, and proactively working with sponsors, the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines, including Novavax, is being significantly expedited without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy. In January 2021, the TGA granted provisional determination to Novavax. The next step in the approval process is for the sponsor to submit an application for provisional registration in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This submission includes a comprehensive dossier that includes specific information on clinical studies, non-clinical/toxicology studies, chemistry, manufacturing, risk-management, and other information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Novavax submitted initial data in February 2021 and, as part of the company's rolling submission, provided its initial quality data tranche in November 2021. The TGA is currently evaluating this data and is in the process of obtaining further information and clarification from the sponsor as the evaluation progresses, as well as being informed by the advice of the Advisory Committee on Vaccines-an independent committee of external experts. More information on these evaluations can be found on the TGA website at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines-undergoing-evaluation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers, and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real-world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts, globally. The nature of these discussions is commercial-in-confidence, but considers the likely timing of supply, cost and recommendations from Government medical experts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rollout and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will occur in line with the Operation COVID Shield National COVID Vaccine Campaign Plan. For specific information on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, please visit my Department's website at:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning petition number EN3314 which seeks further funding and resources into the research of Alzheimer's disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. The Australian Government recognises the significant impact it has on Australians and remains committed to funding quality health and medical research to find better treatments and cures. Health and medical research has been identified as one of the key pillars supporting the health system and is essential to building a stronger, sustainable health system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has established the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) to support health and medical research, improve health outcomes and quality of life. Since its inception through to 31 October 2021, the MRFF has invested $18.8 million in Alzheimer's disease research.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Dementia, Ageing and Aged Care Mission (DAAC Mission) is a research program under the MRFF that is investing $185 million from 2018-19 to 2028-29. The DAAC Mission aims to reduce the impact of dementia by improving detection, prevention, assessment and treatment and care and support for people living with dementia. More information on the DAAC Mission can be found at: </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DAAC Mission is supported by an Expert Advisory Panel (EAP) formed to provide advice to the Minister for Health and Aged Care about the research priorities for the DAAC Mission. The EAP has developed a strategic plan for research investment from the DAAC Mission, communicated through a Roadmap and Implementation Plan, identifying priority objectives for the DAAC Mission and a research plan to address those objectives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the first projects funded under the DAAC Mission was the 'Clem Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research', which was awarded $10 million in 2019. This centre brings together Australia's largest group of researchers focusing on areas such as Alzheimer's disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DAAC Mission is underpinned by a Roadmap and Implementation Plan which outlines priority areas for investment over the short, medium and long-term. The 2020 DAAC Mission Grant Opportunity awarded $3.9 million to accelerate the use of blood tests in clinical settings that can help to diagnose, and predict the onset of, Alzheimer's disease. The grant will also examine the impact of having a diagnostic blood test for Alzheimer's disease on health and management outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Mission will generate measurable improvements for those living with dementia, increasing the healthy lifespan experienced by older Australians and improving care for older Australians across all care settings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the MRFF 10 Year Plan announced in the 2019-20 Budget, $614 million is committed over 10 years under the Clinical Trials Activity Initiative. A significant proportion of the Clinical Trials Activity initiative budget is dedicated to supporting clinical trials that focus on rare cancers, rare diseases and unmet need (RCRDUN). The MRFF RCRDUN grant opportunities support clinical trials research that investigates new drugs, devices or treatments for rare cancers/diseases or for areas of unmet medical need, such as Alzheimer's disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Information on MRFF grant opportunities is available on the Government's GrantConnect website at: www.grants.gov.au. If they haven't already done so, researchers are strongly encouraged to register with GrantConnect to receive alerts for upcoming MRFF grant opportunities. In addition to these investments, since 2014, the National Health and Medical Research Council has awarded over $466 million in direct funding to 429 dementia research projects. This includes funding through the Boosting Dementia Research Initiative (2014--2019).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also committed to improving the quality of life and care for people living with dementia. In response to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, an investment of over $229 million is being made to improve support for people living with dementia and their carers at every stage of a dementia journey. Together this will ensure people living with dementia are connected with the support they need post-diagnosis, are enabled to remain in their home for longer, and able to access high quality, dementia informed aged care services.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3315 Freedom of choice—COVID Vaccine, requesting legislation against mandatory COVID-19 vaccination passports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees or needs careful consideration, taking into account the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government understands that some businesses are considering whether to require vaccination as a condition of service or entry. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises. However, anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there are exemptions in place for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a prescription medicine (including a COVID-19 vaccine) can be legally supplied in Australia, it must be approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and it will be subject to well-established and rigorous assessment and approval process of the TGA to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021, enclosing petition EN3318 with 83 signatures, concerning rules to mandatory hotel quarantine imposed on incoming/returned travellers to Australia, being replaced with home quarantine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Quarantine arrangements have been an ongoing and critical feature of Australia's border management since March 2020. In accordance with the National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response (National Transition Plan), Australia is reopening its international border in a phased and careful way. Under Phase C of the National Transition Plan, there has been a gradual reopening of inward and outward international travel with safe countries and reduced quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated inbound travellers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Quarantine arrangements including the type and duration, are a matter for the states and territories in accordance with the National Transition Plan. Quarantine-free arrangements for fully vaccinated travelers, including Australian citizens and permanent residents returning to Australia from overseas, have been introduced in some states and territories. All states and territories now either have reduced or modified quarantine arrangements in place for fully vaccinated travellers, or plans to introduce them once vaccination targets are met.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Travellers who are not eligible for vaccination or who are unable to be vaccinated on medical grounds, can also access modified quarantine arrangements with appropriate evidence. Arrangements are also in place to support the travel of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 12-17 year olds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All international travellers are required to follow and comply with quarantine and COVID-19 testing arrangements of the state they enter. People who are wishing to travel onwards to another state or territory may also be subject to a quarantine period or may not be allowed to enter. Information on all of these arrangements is available on the respective state or territory health website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, enclosing Petition EN3332 with 332 signatures, seeking to include parents of Australian citizens including those who migrated to Australia, and permanent residents, as immediate family for the purposes of Australia's travel restrictions. Your correspondence was referred to me as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's current travel restriction policy has played a foundational role underpinning the management of COVID-19's impact on public health in Australia and was implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As announced by the Australian Government on 22 October 2021, parents of adult Australian citizens and permanent residents will be considered immediate family for travel exemption purpose. Parental relationships for the purpose of a travel exemption to travel to Australia include biological, adoptive, legal, step-parent, and parents-in-law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Applications for a travel exemption to have the relationship confirmed can be submitted through the Department of Home Affairs' Travel Exemption Portal.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, before travelling, parents must also have a valid passport, a valid visa for travel to Australia and be fully vaccinated with a recognised vaccine. These requirements will be checked by the airline before boarding. Further information on the requirements prior to travel to Australia is outlined on the Department's website at:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that since the travel restrictions were introduced in March 2020, many families with parents overseas have missed significant life events and therefore would like to extend my thanks to these families for their patience and their sacrifice over this period.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021, referring Petition EN3349 for written response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges that family breakdowns are incredibly difficult and the Child Support Scheme is in place to ensure that, as far as possible, children affected by a family breakdown remain financially secure until they reach 18 years of age, regardless of the custody arrangements in place. The Child Support Scheme achieves this by facilitating the assessment and collection of child support between parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioner may be interested in the following information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Child Support Scheme does not make any distinction based on the gender or background of either parent. The child support formula (through the Costs of the Children Table) determines the total costs of raising children in each case (based on parental income and the number and age of children), and distributes these costs between each parent based on their proportion of the assessed income and the amount of care they have for their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Child support assessments are generally calculated on the actual care of the children, as this helps to ensure they have access to an adequate amount of ongoing financial support, regardless of whom they reside with. Services Australia may take into account the amount of time during both day and night that each parent cares for the child, as well as who is responsible for making arrangements for, and decisions about, the child's welfare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For court-ordered arrangements, if there is a dispute, the percentage of care used in the court order can be used to determine the child support assessment for an interim period of up to 52 weeks, if the disputed care change occurs within the first year of the order. For older court orders, the interim period is up to 26 weeks if the person with increased care does not take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution. For care arrangements under a non-enforceable agreement or parenting plan, the interim period can be up to 14 weeks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where the care of the children is not agreed by the parents, these issues are best dealt with through mediation or dispute resolution, or pursued through the family law system. Services Australia does not have a role in mediating care arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A parent's adjusted taxable income, rather than net or gross income, is used in the child support formula to calculate both parents' child support income. Adjusted taxable income for the last relevant financial year is usually the most up-to-date and accurate annual income information available to Services Australia. This income comprises taxable income (that is, income before tax but after any allowable deductions) and certain supplementary amounts such as foreign income. reportable fringe benefits, tax-free pensions and benefits, total net investment losses and reportable superannuation contributions. A parent's child support income is their adjusted taxable income less the self-support amount, and the relevant dependent child amount (if applicable).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the principles which underpins the Child Support Scheme is that all children of a parent should be treated as equally as possible, regardless of the order of their birth. This is the principle behind how a relevant dependent child amount is calculated. The relevant dependent child amount and calculations are the same regardless of whether the parent is a paying parent, or a receiving parent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If either parent believes their child support assessment is unfair because of the special circumstances of their case, they can seek a review under the change of assessment process. There are a broad range of circumstances Services Australia can consider, including the earning capacity of either parent, travel costs to visit children and financial hardship.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A child support debt or overpayment may occur if a liability is not paid in full by the due date, or where there are changes to an assessment that are retrospective. such as a care change or corrections to a parent's income when there is a reconciled estimate, or a backdating of income when a tax return is lodged.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where a child support debt or overpayment has been raised, Services Australia will encourage the parent to enter into a voluntary payment arrangement to repay their debt in the shortest possible time. Services Australia will work with parents who may experience hardship as a result of a debt or overpayment to negotiate a repayment arrangement based on their individual circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the majority of parents do the right thing, Services Australia has extensive enforcement powers to ensure parents meet their child support obligation. Enforcement powers include the ability to directly garnishee wages, recover funds from bank accounts, tax returns or certain income support payments, the power to prevent child support defaulters from travelling overseas. and litigation action through a court.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government funds a range of support services such as Lifeline. Lifeline provides confidential online, phone and face to face crisis support and suicide prevention services for persons experiencing a personal crisis, 24 hours a day. 7 days a week. The service is available throughout Australia and can be contacted on 13 1114, or online at www.lifeline.org.au. Another program which specifically supports men is MensLine Australia, a 24-hour counselling. information and referral service for men. MensLine Australia can be contacted on 1300 789 978, or through their website at www.mensline.org.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System (the Committee) has conducted a wide-ranging Inquiry into the Scheme and made a number of recommendations. The Government is considering the Committee's recommendations, relating to child support and family safety, and will respond to the Committee's report.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Everyone maintains the option to choose. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have now issued public-health orders which require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about public-health orders may be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers have also started to mandate vaccinations for their employees. For individual businesses not covered by a public-health order, whether to require COVID-19 vaccinations for employees or needs careful consideration, taking into account the relevant employment, discrimination, work health and safety, and privacy laws, and the circumstances of the particular workplace. The Government encourages employers and employees to work together on workplace vaccination for COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government understands that some businesses are considering whether to require vaccination as a condition of service or entry. Businesses do have the right to make any service they provide subject to conditions and can impose restrictions on who can enter their premises. However, anti-discrimination issues may arise where people are unable to be vaccinated, and privacy laws restrict the collection of sensitive information. In each case, businesses need to consider their legal obligations, and determine what is right for their business.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a prescription medicine (including a COVID-19 vaccine) can be legally supplied in Australia, it must be approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and it will be subject to well-established and rigorous assessment and approval process of the TGA to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021 enclosing Petition EN3356 with 1712 signatures, concerning the <span style="font-style:italic;">Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Act 2021</span> (the Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act forms part of the Australian Government's response to the challenges posed by the increasing use of the dark web and anonymising technologies, which allows criminals, including terrorists and other malicious actors to hide from law enforcement. This has made committing serious crimes at volume and across borders easier than ever before.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act provides the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) with new powers to identify and disrupt serious criminal activities online. Data disruption warrants enable the AFP and the ACIC to frustrate the commission of serious offences online by modifying, adding or deleting data. Network activity warrants enable the AFP and ACIC to collect intelligence on serious criminal activity carried out by criminal networks online. Account takeover warrants allow the AFP and ACIC to take control of a person's online account to gather evidence about criminal activity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each of these warrants are issued by an independent issuing authority and must relate to an offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment of three years or more. Before a warrant can be issued, the issuing authority must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds founding the application for the warrant and have regard to certain matters, including the nature and gravity of the conduct constituting the offence, privacy and the impact on innocent third parties. The Government has no control over issuing authority decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The powers are accompanied by strong safeguards which protect the privacy of Australians and ensures that the powers are used only where necessary, proportionate and reasonable. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman oversee the AFP and ACIC's use of these powers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The operation, effectiveness and implications of these powers will be subject to review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These new powers are highly targeted, only able to be obtained in relation to the investigation of serious criminal offences and only once an independent issuing authority is satisfied all relevant criteria are met. The strong safeguards that form part of these powers ensure they will be used appropriately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has designed these new laws very carefully to ensure the Act strikes the appropriate balance between respecting individual privacy and the rule of law on which our democracy is based, while still giving our Australian law enforcement agencies the vital powers they need to keep the community safe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN3356 to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021, enclosing Petition EN3357 with 665 signatures, concerning easing of travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Australians to depart Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's current travel restriction policy has played a key foundational role underpinning management of COVID-19's impact on public health in Australia and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be aware that on 26 October 2021, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, amended the Biosecurity Determination 2020 so that fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents would be exempt from Australia's travel restrictions for departing Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As of 1 November 2021, the outwards travel exemption requirement has been lifted for fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents aged 12 and over. This means Australians can leave and enter Australia without restriction, subject to any local State or Territory health and quarantine requirements upon return.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International travel without needing to apply for an exemption is a 'vaccination advantage' for those Australian citizens and permanent residents who are fully vaccinated. The Department of Home Affairs' website provides guidance for travellers on the requirements prior to undertaking their travel. This information is available at:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Family migration is an important element of Australia's migration system, allowing Australian citizens and permanent residents to reunite with their family members and contributing to stronger social cohesion outcomes.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It has been the long-standing practice of successive governments to manage the orderly delivery of Migration Program outcomes against planning levels. The Australian Government sets the size and composition of the Migration Program each year through the Government's Budget process following consultations with state and territory governments, business and community groups and the wider public.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 15 November 2021, the Department of Home Affairs published a request for public submissions as part of the 2022-23 Migration Program planning process on its website at:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following the public consultations, the permanent Migration Program is set with Australia's immediate and longer-term economic and social needs in mind. Immigration policy has enduring effects on many dimensions of Australian life. Getting the policy settings right is critical to maximising community wellbeing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The relative merits of any policy needs to be assessed against a broader context that takes into account all the relevant dimensions of societal wellbeing, including issues around Parent visas which are complex because:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the economic outcomes of immigrant parents are typically poor. They tend to have low integration into the labour market largely due to their older ages and, in some cases, poorer than average English-language proficiency. This means lower income (and income tax) than other immigrants;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">immigrant parents are at stages of their lives when they make considerable claims on the aged care, health and social security systems, which must be met through taxpayer funds; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">immigrant parents can make valuable social contributions to their families, but these mainly benefit the family members themselves rather than the broader social contributions made by other immigrants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the Contributory Parent visa charge of just under $50 000 meets only a fraction of the fiscal costs for the annual intake of contributory parent visa holders. As stated by the Productivity Commissioner in the Migrant Intake into Australia—Productivity Commission Inquiry Report Overview &amp; Recommendations- No. 77, 13 April 2016, overall, the cumulated lifetime fiscal costs (in net present value terms) of a parent visa holder in 2015-16 is estimated to be between $335 000 and $410 000 per adult, which ultimately must be met by the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Productivity Commissioner found that reflecting their average older age and lower labour market engagement, the parent visa stream makes considerable demands on Australia's health, aged care and social security system, while not making many fiscal contributions through taxes paid. The contributory parent visa charge recognises the high expected net fiscal costs of parents. However, at its current level, it is only a small portion of these expected costs. Accordingly, most of the costs must be borne by the community as a whole, whereas many of the benefits accrue to the sponsors and the parents themselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Historically, Australia's permanent Migration Program has had a distribution of two-thirds Skill and one-third Family visas since 2005-06.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2020-21, in response to the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of the Family stream was expanded. The restriction on the number of places allocated Parent visas was designed to ensure that priority in the family stream category was given to partners and dependent child applicants. This aligned with the current Australian Government's policy intentions during the pandemic, the need to give priority to certain applications, and to manage the size and composition of the Migration Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 11 May 2021, the Government announced as part of the Budget, that the overall Migration Program settings would continue into 2021-22. This maintains an expanded Family stream, with priority in the Family stream category given to immediate family members who are partner and dependent child applicants. Further, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on visa applicants is being continually monitored, and visa settings reviewed to respond to the global challenges posed by COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2021-22 Migration Program year, there are 4,500 Parent visa places available, being 900 places for Parent &amp; Aged Parent visas and 3,600 places for Contributory Parent visas. Once this number is reached, no more visas will be granted in the migration program year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Outside the Migration Program, there are 15,000 places each financial year for parents of Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens to apply for the Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa, which allows parents to reunite with their children temporarily for up to 3 or 5 years in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the interest of equity for visa applicants who apply for a Parent visa in the Migration Program, all visa applications are assessed in lodgement date order. If the visa application meets the initial visa criteria, the visa application is placed in a queue. Visa applications are released from the queue for finalisation in queue date order. There are no provisions to consider compelling and compassionate reasons to expedite one Parent visa application over another as it may disadvantage other applicants who may be in similar or more compelling circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Processing times for Parent visas are impacted by a range of factors, including the number of places the Government allocates to a program each year, and the level of demand for each visa category. High volumes of Parent visa application lodgements, which for a number of years exceeded annual migration planning levels set by successive Governments, have impacted on processing times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the availability of key assessment services (such as medical checks). This has impacted applicants' ability to meet visa criteria, and disrupted the Department's visa processing services. This has had the flow on effect of increasing processing times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The time taken to process visa applications can also vary according to the individual circumstances of each case. The quality and completeness of applications, applicants' responsiveness to requests for information, and the complexity often involved in assessing 'genuineness of relationship', character, health and security requirements, can influence processing times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government appreciates that the limited number of places for these visas each year may be disappointing for some members of the community. Ultimately, the Migration program must strike the right balance between sustainable family reunion and maximising Australia's longer term economic growth and prosperity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Your representation and the concerns raised will be taken into account as future policy settings on this issue are considered as previously outlined above. However, increasing the number of places for Parent visa may have significant cost implications and would need to be considered by the Government in the context of budget decisions and the current economic climate.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning the petition to require the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) to direct that all Australian health professionals be able to provide uncensored advice about other possible ways of treating COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ahpra is not an Australian Government agency. Ahpra is an independent body established under state and territory legislation. Ahpra works in partnership with 15 National Boards to regulate 16 health professions in Australia and is responsible for implementing the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (Scheme). The Scheme's primary objective is to ensure the safety of the public. Neither I nor my Department have the authority to direct Ahpra and/or National Board in their roles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 vaccinations are safe and effective and are a crucial part of the public health response to the pandemic. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) published 'Clinical guidance on the use of the COVID-19 vaccines in Australia' (Guidance). The Guidance states the goal of the COVID-19 vaccination program is to protect all Australians from the harm caused by COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All health practitioners in Australia must adhere to a code of conduct for their profession. The codes require all health practitioners to provide sound, evidence-based advice to patients about all treatments, including the COVID-19 vaccination. This means discussing both the risks and benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The codes also require practitioners to ensure their personal views do not adversely affect the care of their patient or the referrals they make. Under the codes, practitioners who conscientiously object to providing a treatment are obligated to inform their patients and, if relevant, colleagues of their objection. Additionally, practitioners must not let their objections prevent the patient from seeking treatment from another practitioner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Publicly sharing anti-vaccination statements or health advice that contradicts the best available evidence is not supported by the National Boards and may be a breach of the codes. It is important to note all notifications regarding health practitioner conduct, including reports of anti-vaccination statements, are thoroughly and fairly investigated by Ahpra and action only taken if there is a risk to public safety.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence to Petition Number EN3381 concerning requests to instruct the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) to direct that all Australian health professionals be able to provide uncensored advice concerning the COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ahpra is not an Australian Government agency but rather an independent body established under state and territory legislation. Ahpra works in partnership with 15 National Boards to regulate 16 health professions in Australia and is responsible for implementing the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (Scheme). The Scheme's primary objective is to ensure the safety of the public. Neither I nor my Department have the authority to direct Ahpra and/or National Boards in their roles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 vaccinations are safe and effective and are a crucial part of the public health response to the pandemic. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation published 'Clinical guidance on the use of the COVID-19 vaccines in Australia' (Guidance). The Guidance states the goal of the COVID-19 vaccination program is to protect all Australians from the harm caused by COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All health practitioners in Australia must adhere to a Code of conduct (Code) for their profession. The Code requires all health practitioners to provide sound, evidence-based advice to patients about all treatments, including the COVID-19 vaccination. This means discussing both the risks and benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code also requires practitioners to ensure their personal views do not adversely affect the care of their patient or the referrals they make. Under the Code, practitioners who conscientiously object to providing a treatment are obligated to inform their patients and, if relevant, colleagues of their objection. Additionally, practitioners must not let their objections prevent the patient from seeking treatment from another practitioner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Publicly sharing anti-vaccination statements or health advice that contradicts the best available scientific evidence is not supported by the National Boards and may be a breach of the Code. It is important to note all notifications concerning health practitioner conduct, including reports of anti-vaccination statements, are thoroughly and fairly investigated by Ahpra and action only taken if there is a risk to public safety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021 to the Treasurer, the Hon Josh Frydenberg MP, regarding Petition EN3384 on the removal of HECS debts. As the acting Minister for Education and Youth, your correspondence has been provided to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports access and participation in higher education through a number of programs including the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) and through the provision of Commonwealth supported places. The HELP scheme is an income contingent loan scheme that removes upfront barriers to education and is one of the most generous schemes in the world. It is reasonable for the Government to require students, who benefit from deferring their higher education tuition costs through HELP, to repay those costs. Outstanding HELP debt as at 30 June 2021 was reported at $68.7 million, repayment of which is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As HELP debt is income contingent, debtors are only required to make repayments if and when they can afford to do so. Repayment rates for income thresholds increase in scale, so that repayment is less for lower incomes. HELP debtors experiencing financial hardship can apply to the Australian Taxation Office for a deferral or amendment of compulsory repayments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 11 November 2021 concerning petition number EN3396, regarding the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)'s coverage of the Biloela family case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have certainly been left in no doubt that the petitioners regard the ABC's coverage of the Biloela family case as lacking in journalistic impartiality and balance. It is very important that the broadcaster's news and current affairs coverage meets the standards which Parliament, on behalf of all Australians, requires of it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Even though the Morrison Government provides an overall level of funding to the ABC, the broadcaster has content and editorial independence. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Parliament has guaranteed this independence so the broadcaster's decisions are free from political interference. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under this arrangement, the manner in which the ABC presents its programming is a matter for the ABC Board and executive. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although editorially independent, the ABC Board is required to develop a Code of Practice relating to programming matters and to lodge this code with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the broadcaster is accountable to the Parliament through annual reports, corporate plans, financial and performance audits, and appearances before Parliamentary Committees. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I continue to maintain regular contact with the ABC Board to encourage them to maintain the broadcaster's adherence to its Charter, so it can provide useful and informative services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I encourage concerned members of the public to actively engage with the ABC. Direct contact is the best way to guarantee that the ABC is made aware of the public's concerns and is given the opportunity to respond.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021 enclosing petition EN3418 with 6 signatures, concerning the re-opening of Australia's international border, international safe travel zones, and quarantine requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In accordance with the National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response (National Transition Plan), Australia is reopening its international border in a phased and careful way. Fully vaccinated Australians, permanent residents and their families have been able to return home since 1 November 2021, and on 21 November 2021, Australia welcomed back fully vaccinated Singaporean travelers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 15 December 2021, fully vaccinated eligible visa holders, including international students, skilled migrants, and refugee, humanitarian, temporary and provisional family visa cohorts have been able to travel to Australia without a travel exemption.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia also reopened its borders to travel by fully vaccinated citizens of Japan and the Republic of Korea from 15 December 2021. This step-by-step and safe reopening is a result of the success Australia, and Australians, have achieved through the vaccination rollout and in implementing the National Transition Plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Quarantine arrangements including the type and duration, are a matter for the states and territories in accordance with the National Transition Plan. Quarantine-free arrangements for fully vaccinated travelers, including Australian citizens and permanent residents returning to Australia from overseas, have been introduced in some states and territories. All states and territories now either have reduced or modified quarantine arrangements in place for fully vaccinated travellers, or plans to introduce them once vaccination targets are met.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Travellers who are not eligible for vaccination (such as those under 12 years of age), or who are unable to be vaccinated on medical grounds, can also access modified quarantine arrangements with appropriate evidence. Arrangements are also in place to support the travel of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 12-17 year olds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All international travellers are required to follow and comply with quarantine and COVID-19 testing arrangements of the state they enter. People who are wishing to travel onwards to another state or territory may also be subject to a quarantine period or may not be allowed to enter. Information on all of these arrangements is available on the respective state or territory health website.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Interactive Gambling Act 2001</span> (the IGA) makes it illegal for gambling providers to offer some online services to people in Australia. Prohibited services include online casino-style gaming services of chance or mixed skill and chance, such as online poker and slot machines, which are played for money or anything else of value.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The IGA does not capture computer games as they are considered a game of skill, though there may be some chance element in the game. In general, loot boxes and similar items are not considered to be interactive gambling services under the IGA.

Many online app and game storefronts (e.g. Apple App store, Google Play store) advise at the point of sale if a game includes in-game purchases. Both the Google Play store and the Apple App store also require games apps to disclose the odds of receiving items in loot boxes since December 2017.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition EN3436, to expedite the introduction of VALNEVA vaccine as a safe alternative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing all Australians, who wish to be vaccinated, with access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has invested in a diverse portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines that use a variety of technical platforms, entering into five separate Advance Purchase Agreements (APA) for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines. These include agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), Novavax, Moderna and the international COVAX Facility.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Combined, these agreements will ensure Australia has access to more than 280 million vaccine doses. Given Australia's participation in COVAX and APAs already in place, the Government is in the process of evaluating its capacity and need for any further APAs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers, including Valneva, and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts, globally. The nature of these discussions is commercial-in-confidence but considers the likely timing of supply, cost and recommendations from Government medical experts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) rigorous assessment and approval processes including clinical trials. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and/or disease. The TGA requires robust scientific data before supporting a vaccine candidate and will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is found to be safe and effective.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Valneva's COVID-19 vaccine candidate commenced Phase 3 clinical trials on 21 April 2021. At this time, Valneva has not yet submitted an application for a provisional determination, therefore Valneva is not currently under evaluation by the TGA. More information on the COVID-19 vaccine application and approval process can be found on the TGA website at:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 enclosing Petition EN3447 concerning Medicare access for mental health services provided by counsellors, psychiatrists and other therapists.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you presenting a petition on this important issue. The Australian Government is committed to mental health reform and is working to ensure all Australians have access to a world-class mental health system supported by a highly trained and qualified workforce.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the Government's $2.3 billion investment in the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan in the 2021-22 Budget includes $58.8 million to grow and upskill the mental health workforce: The Government is also progressing a National Mental Health Workforce Strategy that will consider the quality, supply, distribution and structure of the mental health workforce; and will identify practical approaches governments could implement to attract, train and retain the workforce required to meet patient demand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 30 November 2020, the Government announced $2 million to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule initiative (Better Access) in line with the Productivity Commission's recommendation. The evaluation, due for completion in 2022, provides an opportunity to consider the workforce needed to deliver Better Access services and how the Government can reduce barriers to access while maintaining quality of care for patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The evaluation is supported by a Clinical Advisory Group comprising clinical and other experts and a Stakeholder Engagement Group (SEG) including representation from relevant professional bodies, carers and people with lived experience of mental illness. The SEG includes representatives from a broad range of professional groups including counselling, psychiatry and other therapists. The evaluation findings will help guide future arrangements under the initiative. Further information is available at: www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/better-access-evaluation.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People experiencing financial barriers to accessing mental health support can speak to their referring practitioner about accessing psychological therapy programs offered by Primary Health Networks (PHN).

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 October 2021 concerning petition EN3458 Administer inactivated COVID-19 vaccine options already recognised in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government wants everyone in Australia to have access to a safe, free, COVID-19 vaccine, if they choose to be vaccinated. Moreover, the safety of the population has always been the highest priority of the Government. For these reasons, decisions concerning COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government receives advice on matters relating to COVID-19 vaccines from medical experts, including the COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments for Australia—Science and Industry Technical Advisory Group (SITAG), the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and the Advisory Committee on Vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These expert groups continue to provide clear advice to Government based on the latest scientific evidence and data. Future investments will be subject to the advice of SITAG, and assessment of clinical evidence, including portfolio diversification and risk. SITAG will continue to provide advice to inform the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in Australia based on the most current data and epidemiology.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines must pass the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) rigorous assessment and approval processes including clinical trials. Technical experts analyse the three phases of clinical trials to test for safety at every phase, as well as how effective the vaccine is at protecting against infection and disease. The TGA requires robust scientific data before supporting a vaccine candidate and will only register and approve a COVID-19 vaccine if it is found to be safe and effective.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are no inactivated or live attenuated vaccines for COVID-19 approved by the TGA. All vaccines approved for use in Australia meet the strict standards of the TGA to ensure safety and effectiveness. This means every COVID-19 vaccine available in Australia has been proven to protect against COVID-19. The TGA has provisionally approved four vaccines, so far:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While approved by the TGA, the Janssen vaccine is not included in Australia's COVID-19 vaccination program.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has determined that these vaccines meet the safety, efficacy and quality standards required for use in Australia. The TGA also approved the manufacture of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia. The Vaxzevria vaccine doses used in the initial stages of the rollout were manufactured overseas.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has also 'recognised' Coronavac (Sinovac) and Covishield (Vaxzevria/Serum Institute of India) for the purposes of international travel. These vaccines haven't been approved for use in Australia, but people travelling from overseas who have had these vaccines will have their vaccination status recognised in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has entered into two other agreements to secure vaccines with:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The biotechnology company Novavax, this vaccine has been given provisional determination by the TGA, and if granted provisional approval, it is anticipated that 51 million doses will be available in Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The COVAX facility, this is a global initiative that will provide access to COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. If approved, it is anticipated that 25 million doses will be available to the Australian population.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA is part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines. This information, together with the potential to use already established work-sharing arrangements and collaboration with other international regulators, is assisting the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to meet regularly with a range of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers and manufacturers and continues to monitor ongoing clinical trials and review real-world effectiveness of vaccine rollouts globally. There are more than 400 trials for 140 vaccine candidates worldwide, including a number that are trialling the use of needle-free technology. These include nasal sprays, oral tablets, skin patches and jet injectors.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 22 November 2021 regarding Petition EN3459 that criticises the conduct of Russian parliamentary (Duma) elections held in September 2021. I welcome hearing the views of the Russian-Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am concerned by independent and reliable reports of serious incidents of election fraud during these elections. The Government is also concerned by the Russian Government's measures to exclude potential opponents from the political process, undermine civil society and independent media scrutiny, and place limits on election monitoring. On 17 September, Australia's Ambassador to Russia publicly stressed the importance of independent observers in guaranteeing the transparency of elections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia condemns the mounting repression of opposition politicians and civil society groups in Russia. I issued statements early in 2021 criticising the arrest of opposition figure Alexei Navalny and advocating for an investigation into his poisoning in August 2020. We are also pursuing answers on Navalny's poisoning via the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. On 15 November, Australia's Ambassador to Russia expressed our concerns over efforts to close the long-standing Russian human rights organisation <span style="font-style:italic;">Memorial</span>. DFAT has also raised Australia's concerns on human rights matters directly with Russian officials.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dental treatment was not included under Medicare at its commencement and this policy has largely been continued by successive governments since inception. The Government's policy is to continue to support targeted dental services, rather than include dental care under Medicare.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports states and territories to provide adult public dental services. Between 1 January 2017 and 30 June 2021, the National Partnership Agreement (NPA) on Public Dental Services for Adults provided $458.1 million in funding and supported services to around 763,000 public dental patients.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2021-22 Budget, the Australian Government announced $107.8 million to extend support for adult public services through a Federation Funding Agreement (FFA) until 30 June 2022. The FFA will provide services to an additional 180,000 public dental patients while the Government and state and territory governments negotiate on options for longer term funding arrangements.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also supports the provision of dental services for children through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS). Since its commencement on 1 January 2014, the CDBS has provided over $2.4 billion in benefits and delivered over 39 million services to more than three million children.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the National Health Reform Agreement, the Government contributes funds to the states and territories for dental services delivered through public hospitals. This includes services provided through emergency departments, hospitals, and community health settings. Between 2017-18 and 2019-20 the Government provided approximately $541 million in funding for these services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also supports access to private sector dental services through the Private Health Insurance (PHI) rebate. In the 2021-22 Budget, $6.7 billion ($27.8 billion between 2021-22 and 2024-25) was committed for the PHI rebate to make private health insurance more affordable. In 2018-19, $718 million was provided to support dental services through the PHI Rebate.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 November 2021 enclosing petition EN3463 with 16,808 signatures, concerning temporary visa holders currently living in Australia being able to return to Australia without the need to seek an exemption, when the international border opens during Phase C of the National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response (the National Plan).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In accordance with the National Plan, Australia is reopening its international border in a staged and careful way. Fully vaccinated Australians, permanent residents and their families have been able to leave Australia and return home exemption-free since 1 November 2021, and on 21 November 2021, Australia welcomed back fully vaccinated Singaporean citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 15 December 2021, fully vaccinated eligible visa holders have been able to come to Australia outside of arrivals caps, without needing to apply for a travel exemption. Eligible visa holders include skilled and student cohorts, working holiday makers, as well as refugee, humanitarian and temporary and provisional family visa holders. In addition, eligible temporary visa holders currently in Australia are able to leave Australia and return without applying for a travel exemption.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia also reopened its borders to exemption-free travel by fully vaccinated citizens of Japan and the Republic of Korea from 15 December 2021. More information will be provided on how Australia will reopen to visitors and tourists at the appropriate time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People currently in Australia intending to travel overseas and return, and other travellers to Australia are strongly encouraged to check the specific health and quarantine requirements relating to the state or territory to which they are planning to return.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 22 November 2021 concerning petition number EN3468 asking the House to consider implementing restrictions on financial benefits for unvaccinated individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia. Although we encourage and aim to have as many Australians vaccinated as possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicare is Australia's universal health insurance scheme. It guarantees all Australians (and some overseas visitors) access to a wide range of health and hospital services at low or no cost. This access is regardless of their vaccine status and the Government is not considering changes to this arrangement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is responsible for setting Medicare Benefits Schedule fees and rebates, general practices are private businesses and GPs are free to determine the services that they provide to patients and to set the value of the fees that they charge for those services. GPs are also free to set their own policies concerning patient bookings and are not legally obliged to accept every patient who seeks a booking.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has made it mandatory for those working in residential aged care to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, which was advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and accepted by National Cabinet. This is enforced through state and territory public health orders, effective 17 September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is not considering making the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in other sectors at this time, including for healthcare workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 29 November 2021 (EN3502), concerning increasing Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA) for National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) tenants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands housing is fundamental to the welfare of all Australians. Access to secure and affordable housing has significant economic and social benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While state and territory governments (states) are responsible for the provision of day-to-day housing and homelessness services, in 2021-22 the Australian Government expects to spend around $9.3 billion to help improve housing and homelessness outcomes. This includes $1.6 billion through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement (NHHA) to states.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the NHHA, states are responsible for determining priorities and the type and locations of services funded. States also make decisions about social housing, including the building. allocation, refurbishment of dwellings, complaints and all other tenancy matters. They are also responsible for private rental market regulation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">CRA is a non-taxable income supplement payable with income support payments, Family Tax Benefit Part A. and veterans service pensions or income support supplements, to eligible Australian individuals and families renting in the private rental market and community housing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2021-22, the Australian Government expects to spend $5.3 billion on CRA, to assist around 1.5 million eligible individuals and families with the cost of their rent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">CRA is adjusted each year in March and September, in line with Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases. It is important to note CPI increases reflect an average rise in the cost of living and may not reflect an individual's circumstances. CRA is not intended to reimburse recipients for the full cost of their private rent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2021-22, the Australian Government will provide around $250 million for NRAS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the conclusion of the 10-year incentive period for these dwellings, ongoing tenancy arrangements are a matter to be discussed between tenants, tenancy managers, approved participants and the investors who own the properties. The dwellings will remain subject to all relevant state government tenancy and landlord laws, with respect to lease agreements and rental increases. CRA will still be available for eligible tenants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The department recommends tenants contact their state or territory housing authority for information on potential housing options and other relevant services available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me. I trust this information is of assistance. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition EN3503 to stop the banning of plastic products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is strongly committed to reducing waste, increasing recycling rates and building capacity in Australia's recycling industry. Marine plastic debris, which is largely comprised of land-sourced plastics, poses a significant transboundary risk to marine ecosystems, wildlife and our communities. That is why the government is taking unprecedented action to manage plastic pollution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is working with states and territories to implement the National Waste Policy Action Plan 2019 (the Plan), which sets out the policy direction for priority actions on waste management and recycling in Australia to 2030. Under the Plan, the Commonwealth, along with state and territory environment ministers, have committed to phasing out eight types of problematic plastic products through sustainable design, innovation or the introduction of sustainable alternatives by 2025, or sooner in some cases. These include lightweight plastic bags, plastic products misleadingly termed as 'degradable', plastic straws, plastic bowls and plates, and plastic utensils and stirrers. In addition, the government launched the nation's first National Plastics Plan, which outlines that taking responsibility for our waste will, in some instances, mean phasing out problematic and unnecessary single-use plastics.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">1 refer to your correspondence of 29 November 2021 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning the request to end animal testing for all chemicals in Australia (Petition number: EN3507).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Industrial Chemicals Act 2019</span> implements the legislative component of the Australian Government's ban on cosmetic testing on animals. Through this legislation, animal testing for new cosmetic ingredients was banned in Australia on 1 July 2020. This means new ingredients used exclusively in cosmetics that are sold or manufactured in Australia are unable to use data from animal testing to prove safety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's ban on the use of animal test data for cosmetics aligns with the European Union's approach to ensure the ongoing protection of public health and the environment, worker safety, as well as minimal impacts on business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To complement the ban, my Department worked with the National Health and Medical Research Council to ban the use of animals in cosmetic testing through an amendment to the Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (Code) and is available at: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code is adopted under state and territory legislation, providing a framework for ethical and responsible care and use of animals for scientific purposes in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department also partnered with Accord Australasia, the peak national association representing the cosmetics industry, and animal welfare groups, predominantly RSPCA Australia, to develop a Voluntary Industry Code of Practice (Industry Code) to support the ban. The Industry Code provides guidance to the industry in relation to appropriate promotional claims about animal testing on cosmetic products and provides consumers with greater clarity around the definitions of animal testing claims on cosmetic products. The Industry Code is available on the Accord Australasia website at:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">www.accord.asn.au/sustainability/voluntary-industry-code-on-animal-test-ban.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the Government's commitment around cosmetic testing, chemicals that have a 'multiuse' are excluded from the ban. Expanding the scope of the ban could lead to broader risks to human health or environmental safety and would be inconsistent with other bans internationally. Non-cosmetic end uses of industrial chemicals can pose higher risks and by their nature can expose workers to relatively high chemical concentrations. Therefore, more comprehensive risk assessments are needed to protect human health and the environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, you may be interested to note that it is estimated that less than one per cent of 'multiuse' cosmetic ingredients used animal test data to support their introduction into Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am also pleased to advise that the ban encourages the use of alternatives to animal test data for industrial chemicals (including cosmetics). The Government remains committed to further exploring the opportunities presented by these alternate approaches to demonstrate the safety of these chemicals for both humans and the environment.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 29 November 2021 concerning petition number: EN3513 to increase access to naloxone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting initiatives to reduce and prevent harms caused by drugs and is investing in a pilot program to improve access to naloxone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Take Home Naloxone Pilot (pilot) which commenced 1 December 2019 and will run through to 30 June 2022, naloxone is available free-of-charge and without a prescription in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia to anyone who may either experience or witness an opioid overdose or adverse reaction. People are able to access naloxone from a variety of places, which may include the local pharmacy but also alcohol and drug centres and needle and syringe programs. The program aims to assist both illicit and prescription opioid users in these states (and their carers, friends and family members) by reducing barriers to access this life saving medicine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The pilot has been evaluated by the University of Queensland with the final evaluation report currently being considered by my Department. Results from the pilot are encouraging and have found that the pilot has saved the lives of people who had overdosed on or had an adverse reaction to opioid drugs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You will also be pleased to know that access to naloxone has been greatly improved with the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) listing on 1 November 2019 of the Nyxoid® nasal spray. This formulation is simple and easy to use and has been the most commonly supplied product under the pilot.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Naloxone ampoules, pre-filled syringes and the nasal spray continue to be available on the PBS in all states and territories as a General Schedule unrestricted PBS benefit. This means medical and nurse practitioners can prescribe naloxone to users of opioids, their carers, friends and family members. When accessed through the PBS a patient who has a prescription for naloxone will pay a maximum co-payment of $41.30 per script (providing five ampoules, or one pre-filled syringe or two nasal sprays), or $6.60 if they have a concession card.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBS co-payment will count towards the patient's PBS safety-net. Individuals can also purchase naloxone privately over the counter at their local pharmacy if they choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 29 November 2021 concerning Petition Number EN3515—a perceived political influence over medical professionals in their professional practice, specifically referring to influence and intervention by Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, health practitioners are regulated by Ahpra. Ahpra is not an Australian Government agency but rather an independent body established under state and territory legislation. Ahpra works in partnership with 15 National Boards to regulate 16 health professions in Australia and is responsible for implementing the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (Scheme). Neither I nor my Department have the authority to direct Ahpra and/or National Boards in their roles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme's primary objective is to ensure the safety of the public. All health practitioners in Australia must adhere to a Code of conduct (Code) for their profession. The Code requires all health practitioners to provide sound, evidence-based advice to patients about all treatments. This means discussing both the risks and benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code also requires practitioners to ensure their personal views do not adversely affect the care of their patient or the referrals they make. Under the Code, practitioners who conscientiously object to providing a treatment are obligated to inform their patients and, if relevant, colleagues of their objection. Additionally, practitioners must not let their objections prevent the patient from seeking treatment from another practitioner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the petition does not specifically refer to the COVID-19 vaccination program, references to 'treatment for the masses' and criticism of the 'Government narrative' and 'Government agenda' in the petition appear to carry this inference, and warrant being addressed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 vaccinations are safe and effective and are a crucial part of the public health response to the pandemic. The TGA is responsible for the assessment and regulation of therapeutic goods. The TGA ensures that all therapeutic goods available in Australia are safe and fit for their intended purpose. They do not provide clinical advice concerning medicines, health products or treatments such as vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) published 'Clinical guidance on the use of the COVID-19 vaccines in Australia' (Guidance).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Guidance states the goal of the COVID-19 vaccination program is to protect all Australians from the harm caused by COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Publicly sharing anti-vaccination statements or health advice that contradicts the best available scientific evidence, is not supported by the National Boards and may be a breach of the Code. It is important to note all notifications concerning health practitioner conduct, including reports of anti-vaccination statements, are thoroughly and fairly investigated by Ahpra and action only taken if there is a risk to public safety.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 29 2021 regarding petition EN3533, which requests the establishment of a Royal Commission into conditions and culture in the Retail and Fast Food sectors. I welcome the opportunity to respond to the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises concerns in relation to work health and safety (WHS). The Government is a firm believer that all Australians, regardless of their occupation or how they are engaged, have the right to healthy, safe and well-designed work. While WHS is a shared responsibility with the states and territories, the Government takes a leadership role in developing model WHS laws which have been adopted by almost all jurisdictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The model WHS Act provides a framework to protect the health and safety of all workers at work and of other people who might be affected by that work. The model WHS Act imposes a primary duty of care on a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) to ensure at all persons in the workplace, including workers and visitors, are not exposed to health and safety risks. This duty requires risks to health and safety to be eliminated or minimised so far as is reasonably practicable. WHS Ministers also recently agreed to amend the model WHS Regulations to deal with psychological health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Officers of a PCBU must also exercise due diligence to ensure compliance by a PCBU with its health and safety obligations. This duty applies to key strategic, structural, policy and resourcing decisions. Workers also have a duty to take reasonable care for their own health and safety and not adversely affect the safety of others, including through workplace drug abuse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Companies and individuals who breach their duties of care can be subject to criminal offences and sanctions, regardless of whether an incident occurs. This includes imprisonment of up to five years for individuals, and fines of up to $3million for companies and $600,000 for individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also raises concerns in relation to working conditions. The Australian Government has zero tolerance for the exploitation of workers, including the underpayment of wages and entitlements by any employer.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is the national workplace relations regulator, responsible for providing education, assistance and advice about the Commonwealth workplace relations system and impartially enforcing compliance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009</span> (FW Act). Since 2016, the Government has committed over $180 million in new funding to the FWO to prevent wage underpayment and improve compliance with workplace laws. The Government has also strengthened the FWO's evidence-gathering powers and increased, by tenfold, the penalties for 'serious contraventions' of the FW Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The FWO sets annual compliance and enforcement priorities that reflect the industries with the highest risk of non-compliance. In 2021-22, the FWO's priorities include fast food, restaurants and cafes, and large corporate underpayments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2020-21 Budget, the Government provided $22.3 million in funding to the FWO to establish a dedicated Corporate Sector Assurance team to identify, investigate and respond to non-compliance by large corporates. As part of the FWO's focus on large corporate non-compliance, the FWO commenced legal proceedings in the Federal Court on 2 December 2021 against Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd, for the alleged underpayment of salaried employees of $115 million. The FWO also commenced proceedings in the Federal Court on 17 June 2021 against Woolworths Group Limited and Woolworths (South Australia) for the alleged underpayment of salaried workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The FW Act also includes strong general protections provisions which make it unlawful for an employer to take adverse action or engage in coercive conduct against an employee because they have a workplace right, exercise a workplace right or propose to exercise a workplace right. This includes making a complaint or raising a question in relation to their employment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Workers who have concerns about their employment can contact the FWO for free advice and support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is of the view that the current legal frameworks outlined above provide robust protections for all Australian workers while balancing the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 29 November 2021 enclosing Petition EN3535 with 332 signatures, which suggests granting the Australian Federal Police (AFP) special powers to investigate alleged corruption and fraud within state and territory police forces. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The AFP's role is to enforce Commonwealth criminal law, contribute to combating complex, transnational, serious and organised crime impacting Australia's national security, and to protect Commonwealth interests from criminal activity in Australia and overseas. These functions are articulated in section 8 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth)</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory police forces are already subject to oversight from independent bodies, including those focused specifically on law enforcement conduct and corruption. It is appropriate that any oversight of state and territory police is performed by an independent authority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Should the proponents of the petition have concerns about the efficacy of these existing arrangements, they may wish to contact the individual oversight bodies of each jurisdiction to raise these concerns.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 9 November 2020 regarding the petition (EN1910) submitted to the House of Representatives advocating for the Bruce Highway—Tiaro Flood Immunity Upgrade Project (the Project) to deliver a four-lane highway bypass.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that on 2 December 2020 you submitted another petition (PN0488) to the House on this matter, with a notable increase in the number of signatures. Both these petitions highlight concerns that a two-lane bypass design may not adequately address safety issues or cater for future demand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, the Project scope is to deliver a bypass at Tiaro that will improve flood immunity, reduce congestion and remove heavy vehicle traffic away from Tiaro's township to significantly improve safety and liveability for residents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Project's business case is currently under development. As part of this process, traffic modelling for future demand has been undertaken. The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads has advised that a two-lane option will provide sufficient capacity to cater for current and foreseeable traffic demand, however the business case will consider opportunities to support future duplication.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The business case will also identify the most appropriate safety treatments for the bypass, including consideration of grade separated interchanges and a concrete dividing barrier to reduce the risk of head-on collisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised that the business case is expected to be completed by mid-2021 and its outcomes will inform the preferred design. While I understand that this is a matter of importance to the local community, it would be imprudent for the Australian Government to make any formal amendments to the commitment until the outcomes of the business case are known.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention and I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your representations of 9 August 2021 to the Minister for Education and Youth, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, regarding PN0516; a petition to reinstate the School Nutrition Project in Laramba with full coverage cost by the Australian Government. As the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities, I am replying as Minister for Indigenous Australians. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has contributed to funding the School Nutrition Projects since 2007. The National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) provides Indigenous Advancement Strategy funding for the operational costs associated with these projects. An integral element of the program requires parental contributions be paid by families utilising the service. While I appreciate this can be a challenge in some communities, it is an important part of the program, ensuring parental responsibility for the cost of food provided to their child, and supports the long-term sustainability of the program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand NIAA representatives are working with a potential new provider in Laramba, with a view for the School Nutrition Project to recommence in the near future.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">To successfully bring about constitutional change, a majority of Australians and a majority of states must support the proposed amendments. Only eight out of 44 past referenda have been successful and it is important we learn from this and agree to a set of words that are acceptable to the majority of Australians. This is not something that can be rushed, we must consider options that provide the greatest chance of success.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the Indigenous Voice, the Morrison Government has released the <span style="font-style:italic;">Indigenous Voice Co-design Final Report to the Australi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">an Government</span>. The Report is the result of a robust 18-month co-design process to develop proposals for an Indigenous Voice. Co-design groups made up of 52 members from around the country, primarily Indigenous people, led this process and over 9,400 people have had their say on the proposals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Final Report recommends establishing Local &amp; Regional Voices as the first step. Strong local and regional arrangements will ensure legitimacy at the community level as well as helping to establish sustainability and long-term success.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The report made it very clear that for Local &amp; Regional Voices to be successful, they must speak to all levels of government—federal, state and local. This is why the Morrison Government will now commence discussions with states, territories and local governments to encourage their participation in the 35 Local &amp; Regional Voices to be established nationally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government will also continue to co-design during implementation and will work with the other levels of government to set up a Local &amp; Regional Voice Establishment Group. The Final Report is available online at voice.niaa.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On the matter of a Makarrata Commission, in 2018 the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders considered the Referendum Council's position to oversee agreement-making and noted that there are a range of views regarding the process and meaning of Makarrata. The Morrison Government does not support the establishment of a Makarrata Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On the related matter of truth-telling, this is not a contest of ideas but a sharing of the truth. The Morrison Government supports truth-telling at the national level by working in partnership with Indigenous Australians and communities and local, state and territory governments to support reconciliation and to acknowledge and understand our nation's history.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 5 January 2022, the Morrison Government announced the establishment of the Ngurra Cultural Precinct, a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural precinct in the Parliamentary Triangle, incorporating a National Resting Place. The precinct will provide a new perspective on our shared history, as a significant moment for truth-telling, and a new place where the diversity of Indigenous Australia will be celebrated. All who visit Australia's National Cultural Institutions in Canberra will have an opportunity to gain a deeper appreciation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' cultures, and the richness this offers the country.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 29 November 2021 enclosing Petition PN0523 with 566 signatures concerning Australia's humanitarian support for Afghan nationals. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan citizens are a prominent caseload in Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program and have been in the top five countries of origin over the last five years. The Australian Government announced on 18 August 2021 that Afghan citizens will be prioritised for processing within the offshore Humanitarian Program. An initial 3,000 humanitarian places have been allocated to Afghan nationals within Australia's 13,750 annual program, in addition to any visa granted to Afghan nationals up to that date. Particular priority will be given to persecuted minorities, women and children, and those who have close links to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government anticipates this initial allocation will increase further over the course of 2021-22. We are working with Afghan community leaders here in Australia, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to identify and resettle those Afghan refugees most in need. On 25 August 2021, the Government established an Advisory Panel on Australia's Resettlement of Afghan Nationals to provide advice and support to the Government and the Department of Home Affairs and to ensure that that resettlement planning, service provision, and goodwill across communities is harnessed for the Afghan cohort.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you would appreciate, the Government is focussed on ensuring that the Australian response, including further consideration of Humanitarian Program settings, is well considered and meets the needs and priorities of the Afghan community. The Government will make further announcements on the composition and priorities in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Afghan settlement support package is informed by advice from the Government's Advisory Panel on Australia's Resettlement of Afghan Nationals and includes:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is working to ensure that visa options continue to be available to Afghan nationals, both within Afghanistan and those who have been displaced from their home country. All visa applications will be processed in accordance with Government announcements and within program priorities, and assessed on an individual basis. All visa applicants must also meet visa criteria and satisfy public interest criteria for character, security and health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For those remaining in Afghanistan, the situation remains highly volatile, and travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous. Some borders are closed or may close without notice (as outlined in Smartraveller advice). We urge all people remaining in Afghanistan to prioritise their safety and carefully consider the risks should they attempt to leave by any route.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is Government policy that refugees who arrive in Australia illegally and are found to be owed protection, will only be granted temporary protection visas (either a Temporary Protection visa (TPV) or a Safe Haven Enterprise visa (SHEV)) and will not be eligible to sponsor family members to migrate to Australia. This policy was part of a suite of measures intended to deter people smuggling and to encourage use of regular migration pathways, such as the visas available through the offshore Humanitarian Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A TPV is valid for three years, enables the holder to work, study and reside anywhere in Australia, with access to support services. After three years TPV holders' protection claims must be reassessed to determine their eligibility for grant of a subsequent TPV or SHEV. A SHEV is valid for five years and can be granted to eligible applicants who intend to work or study in a regional area. SHEV holders who have worked without accessing Special Benefits and/or studied full time or a combination of both, in a specified regional area for a period totalling 42 months, meet "pathway requirements". Having met the "pathway requirements", they are then eligible to apply for other visas, including certain permanent visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to its international obligations and provides protection to individuals consistent with its obligations set out in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol and other international human rights conventions to which it is a party. Australia does not return individuals to situations where they face persecution or a real risk of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the application of the death penalty. No Afghan currently on a temporary visa in Australia, including on a TPV or SHEV, will be asked to return to Afghanistan while it would be unsafe for them to return. TPV or SHEV holders who want to remain in Australia beyond their visa cease date must apply for a subsequent TPV or SHEV.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the importance of family reunion for refugees and humanitarian entrants. A key aim of Australia's Humanitarian Program is to reunite refugees and people who are in refugee-like situations overseas with their family in Australia through 'split family' provisions and the Special Humanitarian Program (SHP). Immediate family of people who have been resettled under the Humanitarian Program are given highest priority in processing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The SHP allows people who face human rights abuses in their home country and have a connection to the Australian community to settle permanently in Australia. Permanent humanitarian visa holders (including Permanent Protection visa holders) may propose family members for resettlement in Australia through the SHP. The Community Support Program (CSP) offers an additional pathway for refugees who are ready for employment and have the capacity to be financially self-sufficient within a year of arrival in Australia. Within the Humanitarian Program, the CSP and the SHP both afford priority to applicants willing to live in a regional area or proposed by a relative living in regional Australia (Regional Australia is anywhere outside of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Afghan Australians are an integral part of Australian society and the Australian community. The Government is endeavouring to do all we can to continue to assist those affected through our ongoing humanitarian, whole-of-government and collaborative efforts.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The story being told right across Australia, from my electorate of Melbourne to the people of Sydney and Brisbane, is one of their lives being disrupted because of unfair and unsustainable aircraft noise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, following previous bills I have introduced to this place to tackle the problems, I rise now to introduce the Brisbane Airport Curfew and Demand Management Bill 2022. Let me start by saying that this bill is the product of years of community campaigning by thousands of Brisbane residents, standing up to the Brisbane Airport Corporation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I would like to commend the work of Max Chandler-Mather, the Greens candidate for Griffith, Stephen Bates, the Greens candidate for Brisbane, and the Brisbane Flight Path Community Alliance, who have led the way in fighting for a reduction in flight noise. The bill itself was produced after direct and detailed consultation with the Brisbane community, and I want to thank everyone who engaged in that process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the chance to meet some of those residents at a community consultation meeting in the Brisbane suburb of Hawthorne, in the electorate of Griffith. This is an incredibly well informed and organised community. Their feedback over the course of this consultation process has improved the bill, and for that I thank them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unsustainable flight noise has had a devastating impact on the people of Brisbane. A survey of 2,000 Brisbane residents last year found that 81 per cent of respondents had their sleep disrupted as a result of flight noise, 68 per cent of respondents suffered from mental distress, and 11 per cent of respondents had been forced to seek medical help. Studies around the world have shown the terrible health impacts that come with prolonged exposure to high levels of noise and sleep disruption. With international and domestic flight traffic beginning to return, this situation is only going to get worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the community was badly misled in the initial consultation for the new parallel runway at Brisbane Airport. This has been confirmed by two independent authorities, including the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman and the Brisbane Airport advisory committee recently established by the federal government. Both identified serious flaws with the consultation, but unfortunately neither have gone far enough in their recommendations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need immediate action as well as a sustainable, long-term solution to unsustainable flight noise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces a curfew from 10 pm to 6 am and an hourly movement cap of 45 flights per hour at Brisbane Airport. It also directs the minister to instruct Airservices Australia to produce a long-term operating plan for Brisbane Airport that reduces flight noise, ensures more flights over Moreton Bay and changes flight paths to ensure a fair distribution of air traffic over Brisbane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A 10 pm to 6 am curfew will ensure every Brisbane resident is able to get a good night's sleep, without being exposed to unhealthy levels of flight noise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, a flight cap of 45 flights per hour would allow Brisbane Airport to return to pre-pandemic flight traffic, while ensuring they don't grow unsustainably beyond that level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, without a substantial change to flight paths and airport operations, a cap and curfew won't address many of the fundamental issues with Brisbane Airport. This is why the Greens will also legislate to force the transport and infrastructure minister to implement a long-term operating plan for Brisbane Airport. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A long-term operating plan will ensure that better consideration will be given to:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">a fair distribution of flight traffic over Brisbane that ensures no group of residents is forced to bear the overwhelming majority of flights; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">an overall reduction in flight noise for all Brisbane residents by prioritising flight routes that don't pass over residential areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are reasonable and moderate measures that airports around the world have already adopted. Indeed, it's happening around Australia as well. Sydney airport already has a long-term operating plan, a curfew and a cap on flights. The question that both the Liberals and Labor must answer is: if it's good enough for Sydney airport, why isn't it good enough for Brisbane? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brisbane Airport Corporation has said previously it expected annual passenger traffic through its domestic and international terminals would more than double from 22 million in 2014 to 50 million by 2035. It also forecast the number of annual individual flights would grow from 227,000 in 2019 to 360,000 by 2035 and 500,000 by 2045. That is completely unsustainable, in terms of local air and noise pollution and carbon emissions that contribute to the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the pandemic in 2018 the four major privately owned airport corporations, including Brisbane, made a combined profit of $757.6 million—up nine per cent. As we emerge from travel restrictions and begin to see more international travellers visiting Australia, we can expect similar profit levels to return. We must not let the private corporations' relentless pursuit of profits get in the way of a better future for all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear. This is ultimately about the Brisbane Airport Corporation relentlessly pursuing profit at the expense of the community. Like so many big corporations and billionaires, the rules are written in their favour, with little regard given to the community and the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no surprise that Brisbane Airport Corporation has previously donated to the Labor Party, while, as recently as 2018, the Australian Airports Association, the chief lobby group for airport corporations, paid tens of thousands each to Labor and the Liberals for secret cash-for-access meetings. No wonder the major parties are so reluctant to hold the big airport corporations to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, ultimately, is a story of everyday people standing up to the power of a big corporation. And the Greens will always stand with people in that fight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said earlier that this is a story that is happening right around the country, and it is. This bill will apply to Brisbane Airport; previously introduced bills were with respect to Melbourne. Now the electorate that I represent is, as some people would know, some distance from the airport. Some might ask, 'How is it that airport noise has become an issue in the inner city of Melbourne?' The answer is the same as the problem that is being sought to be addressed by this bill with respect to Brisbane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a story being told right around the country. As our cities have grown, and as air travel has grown, no-one has paid attention to what that means for people living under areas of flight paths that aren't immediately adjacent to the airport. There is a whole set of rules in place for people who are near airports; but, for people further afield as well as for people who are living next to airports, the law has not kept up with the rise in traffic. As a result, we see two things. We see the point has been changed where all the planes have to gather and turn around before they loop over the city and come in and land on the runway. As a result, in places like East Melbourne you can look up at certain times of day and see plane after plane after plane going over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the issue in Melbourne of people needing to clock up their training hours, or perhaps going for some joy flights. They're coming in and doing loops around the MCG, which, for the people who live near it, turns into unstainable and unfair aircraft noise with low-level, low-flying planes all the time. No-one has paid attention to it, and it's the same in Brisbane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years the number of flights has increased and flight paths have been changed. They're going over people's houses, and there's nothing in the law to protect them. And instead of taking on the big corporations and government entities that have the chance to regulate it, Labor and the Liberals are captured by these very same organisations and refuse to stand up on behalf of residents. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about getting a better balance, and it's about saying that people who live in our cities have the right to live in peace and to have their amenity protected. This is getting to the point where in Melbourne, as well as in Sydney and now in Brisbane, it is affecting people's health. It is not just a question of not being able to go outside in your own home because of intensive aircraft noise; it is affecting people's health. We need to do something about it, and this bill will do that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This means that, when you install a home battery, you earn certificates which you can then onsell to electricity retailers, who are required to purchase them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under my bill, as under the existing scheme, the precise amount you will save will depend on how big your battery is and how you use it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fundamental point here is this: to unlock massive savings for Australian households, to bring power security to regional households and to accelerate our transition to renewable energy, we need to make home batteries cheaper. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Batteries soak up that extra renewable energy when it's cheap and plentiful and smooth out our grid at night when we need it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His analysis shows that a fully electric household would save around $5,000 a year in petrol costs, in power bills, in heating bills.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I second the motion and I'm delighted to be able to say that the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Cheaper Home Batteries) Bill 2022 is a win-win policy. In short, this bill will amend the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 to make home battery installations eligible for small-scale technology certificates under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme. The SRES has been the centre of the dramatic growth in renewable generation over the last decade. Over three million solar panels have been installed in homes across Australia as a result. Thirty per cent of households now have solar; by 2030 it will be 50 per cent. In Warringah there have been over 6,356 solar connections, making up more than 37,300 kilowatts of power. Each of the three councils also has programs to improve the uptake of solar. This work is strongly supported by Zero Emissions Sydney North and many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we must turn our attention to home battery installations. The effect of this legislation will be to subsidise home batteries, improving the economics and increasing the uptake. Because this scheme is over 15 years, the bill will send a positive long-term investment signal to project developers and investors. It will reduce market volatility, particularly in the middle of the day, and it will support more investment in renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we want batteries? To reduce every person's power bills for households. This will provide important grid services. It's incredibly important that we do this. Only 33,000 batteries were installed last year, but it could easily be compounded over time as the economics improve. We know we need to bring the price of batteries down. It's projected already to drop by 58 per cent by 2030, and we anticipate 500,000 home batteries by 2030, and many more if this bill passes. With this demand, there's an opportunity to create a substantial industry in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question for the government is: are you fair dinkum in wanting to actually deliver net zero and lower the power prices for households? If you are then this is a bill you will support. By processing battery materials for the advanced manufacture of them, we could add $7.4 billion and 35,000 jobs to the economy. So these are the solutions that the government should be focusing on, and I strongly commended the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants to mandate a one-day wait time for network faults to be rectified in the cities, but up to three days in the regions and remote areas. The impact of a 72-hour outage on a small-business balance sheet is immense. You'd think the government would see that and act on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are usually shocked to learn that no internet standards like those I've proposed in this bill exist right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All we have is a general expectation that these companies, including NBN, will be incentivised to build and maintain high-quality broadband infrastructure on the basis that it makes solid and sustainable commercial sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this means is that in regional electorates like mine, where there is no competition, there is no incentive for NBN to continue providing a high level of service over time as the government moves to privatise the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we don't introduce a bill like this, regional Australians will simply have to 'get what they're given' when it comes to internet speed, connection times and fixing faults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over a year ago, the government published draft internet connectivity standards which would entrench, not solve, the telecommunications divide between the cities and the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen zero progress on those draft standards since, and I highly doubt we will before the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's worse is that the government intends to establish those standards via regulation. That means internet standards would be at the total discretion of the minister, not enshrined and protected in law like this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That doesn't sound like adequate protection to me, especially under a government which said the NBN rollout was complete when it wasn't and is trying to force cash-strapped local councils in the regions to foot the bill for the rest of the build.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can legislate and protect employment and education standards, we can legislate and protect internet standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has broad in-principle support from peak bodies across the nation, from the National Farmers Federation to the small business council of Australia and the Australian communications consumer action group. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's some of what the NFF had to say: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Current telco service guarantees and service performance are not up to standard, and change is needed to reflect the needs of consumers and businesses</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the value of the tax dollars of Australians in the bush has no lesser value of that of city dwellers … not only is this unjust, the ramifications of drawn-out repairs times are potentially, life-threatening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If Australia is going to continue the transformation to a digital economy in the regions, Statutory Infrastructure Providers [like the NBN] need to provide an environment to support that transformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't agree more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional business leaders and entrepreneurs also back the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of them is the inspirational Jo Palmer, the founder and CEO of Pointer Remote, which empowers city based employers to hire talent remotely in the regions. This is what Jo says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For those who do not have access to a strong, reliable connection, they are excluded from participating in the workforce remotely. The faster and more equitable access to a strong reliable connection secured through the Faster Internet for Regional Australia Bill, we can access work, pay tax and stimulate the economy at a community level, with major flow on effects for national GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And according to Matt Pfahlert, the CEO of the Australian Centre for Rural Entrepreneurship based in Beechworth:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill respects the enormous challenges rural job innovators already face to create new business and industry opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rural communities do not need to be further hobbled, and deserve a sporting chance in a global marketplace by having a reliable telco infrastructure that is currently taken for granted by people in metropolitan areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I couldn't agree more.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the government has backed away when it comes to holding telcos to account in the regions. We deserve communications excellence at all times, just like the cities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">or her choice. What we find today is that we have a grave problem with foreign social media services. We're talking about big tech. We're talking about outfits like Facebook, outfits like Twitter, outfits like Google and YouTube, outfits like Instagram, outfits like WeChat, outfits like TikTok, which have become notoriously censorious of political discourse. In fact, in its biggest example, the then leader of the free world, former President of the United States Donald Trump, was taken down off a fair few of these platforms, particularly Facebook and Twitter. That was much to the delight of the Left across the world. But US venture capitalist Fred Wilson, one of the early investors in Twitter, who is Left leaning and who doesn't like Donald Trump said—and it behoves all of those who delighted about the former president being removed from social media to listen to these words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think it is problematic that Twitter has this much power. Not only are they silencing Trump, they are taking away his tens of millions of followers, and they are prohibiting all of his followers from seeing his tweets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have now so much power invested in this big tech oligarchy. In fact, the American Civil Liberties Union are not known for their like for President Trump or their like for right-wing political views, but their senior legislative counsel, Kate Ruane, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where we're at: these platforms now form the public square; they form the place where ideas are debated, where ideas are put forward, where discussion ensues. We now have these big tech oligarchies controlling that space where political, philosophical, ideological, cultural and social discourse goes on all around the world, including in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At least two members of parliament in this place have been removed, cancelled, by these big tech outfits—one of which is my friend the member for Hughes. Whatever you think of his views, he's an elected member of parliament. He wasn't saying anything that was illegal either on Facebook or on YouTube. He had a video of a speech given to this place removed from YouTube. Further than that, he had his entire profile taken off Facebook and Instagram. I can also refer to the member for Cook, the Prime Minister, who had his posts removed from WeChat. They were not particularly unlawful. They weren't particularly egregious. He was simply putting forward the views of the Australian government to people of Chinese ethnicity in this country, but he was taken off WeChat. We had a foreign social media service, ostensibly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, silencing the Prime Minister of this country in his own country. If that does not ring alarm bells, I don't know what does in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bills of Rights1688, something that all parliamentarians should read up on, established modern democracy, and the Westminster democracy that we're a part of in this place. The Bill of Rights said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we have big tech taking down from their platforms videos they don't like of parliamentary proceedings, debates and even quotes from debates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It extends from members of parliament to media organisations. Sky News had many videos removed from YouTube not for illegal things, again, but because they breached what these big tech outfits call their community standards. There's another term for community standards; it's called editorial guidelines. But these outfits pretend that they're not publishers, and by calling them community guidelines rather than editorial guidelines they get away with it and they don't face defamation. They can't have it both ways. They can't be editors that are chopping and changing content on their platforms and not be liable for things that are said on those platforms. But I would prefer that free speech was let run unabated on these platforms, except for illegal speech or defamatory content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that foreign social media services are interfering with the political discourse in this country. I have outlined that already. In this parliament, we have protected big news media against foreign social media services, or, at least, we've put the money of big tech into the pockets of big news corporations in this country, but we have done nothing to protect the little people out there. My bill seeks to do that in two respects. It gives a terminology of protected persons, which forms the pillars of democracy in this country. It says that there should be no censorship against lawful content from politicians, political candidates, political parties, journalists and news organisations. At the same time, it would provide recourse for people who are censored for their philosophical discourse on social media, allow them a pathway to go to the Australian Communications and Media Authority to adjudicate whether it was right for that censorship to occur, and, if it doesn't, in both instances, there would be fines of over $1 million against these big tech outfits. This is very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will close with a large quote from Joel Kotkin. It explains everything. Read the book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Th</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e Coming of Neo-Feudalism: A Warning to the Global Middle Class</span>. It reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not satisfied with controlling information pipelines, the tech oligarchs have been moving to shape content as well. Controllers like those at Facebook and Twitter seek to "curate" content on their sites, or even eliminate views they find objectionable, which tend to be conservative views, according to former employees. Algorithms intended to screen out "hate groups" often spread a wider net, notes one observer, since the programmers have trouble distinguishing between "hate groups" and those who might simply express views that conflict with the dominant culture of Silicon Valley. That managers of social media platforms aim to control content is not merely the perception of conservatives. Over 70 percent of Americans believe that social media platforms "censor political views" according to a recent Pew study. With their quasi-monopoly status, Facebook and Google don't have to worry about competing with anyone, as the tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel observes, so they can indulge their own prejudices to a greater extent than the businesses that might be concerned about alienating customers. With their tightening control over media content, the tech elite are now situated to exert a cultural predominance that is unprecedented in the modern era. It recalls the cultural influence of the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, but with more advanced technology.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is important. It provides for no less than safeguarding of Australian democracy against the big tech oligarchy that threatens to remake the world, including our country, in their own woke image. We need to act before it's too late.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to make this as simple as I possibly can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National government and Labor opposition's climate target is for net zero emissions by 2050. I think that's too late. The science says that's too late. But that's their target. The Liberal and Labor target is for net zero emissions by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scientists that we pay to advise us on this, as well as the undisputed authority, according to government, on global energy systems, the International Energy Agency, said last year that, to reach net zero by 2050, not one single new coal, oil or gas project can be built—not one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, on the government's official register, there are 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline, containing more than double the amount of Australia's current emissions. That's 2½ times Australia's emissions every year locked up in these projects that the Liberals and Labor want to develop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So either the government and opposition agree on achieving net zero by 2050 or they believe in advancing these 114 projects, even one of which, of the bigger ones, could blow our climate target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maths and physics don't let you believe in both. So which is it—net zero or new coal and gas?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Physics and biochemistry say either we can have farming or we can have coal and gas, but we can't have both. So which is it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining and burning of coal and gas are the leading causes of the climate crisis. So, if you don't have a plan for coal and gas, and you want to open up more coal and gas mines, you don't have a plan to keep Australia safe from a climate breakdown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The executive director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If governments are serious about the climate crisis, there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal, from now—from this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More and more countries are coming up with net zero commitments, which is very good, but I see a huge and growing gap between the rhetoric and the reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He is right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, with our 114 new projects backed by Labor and the Liberals, this gap between rhetoric and reality is as long as the Great Dividing Range.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Energy Agency's research on why we cannot afford any new coal, oil or gas projects being opened up makes intuitive sense. It's what our scientists are telling us, too. It's what the United Nations is telling us, too. You have to stop pouring petrol on the fire before you can start putting it out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Keeping coal and gas in the ground is the very first thing a government would do if they were serious about treating global heating like the climate emergency that it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this bill is being introduced today—to put a pause on the approval of new coal and gas projects. Existing projects in operation will be untouched by this legislation. We can deal with them later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the Greens policy remains for the rapid phase-out of coal and gas on the path to net zero by 2035, this temporary freeze on advancing these 114 projects through the pipeline should be a circuit-breaker that everyone can agree on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need this pause to help develop the policies that the Australian government can take to the next UN climate conference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will be working every day from now until May to kick this rotten government out, but we need to make sure that, in the next parliament, we don't keep opening up new coal and gas projects. One project at Beetaloo, a basin that both Labor and the Liberals want to open up, will increase Australia's pollution by up to 13 per cent just on its own. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the bipartisan commitment that is in place for opening up these new coal and gas projects, it is only through third parties in this place, like the Greens, having power that we are going to see the action the science requires, which means a moratorium on opening up new coal, oil and gas projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then Australia can join in the push that other countries are leading. The United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union are all leading a global push to stop additional pollution from coal and gas and tackle the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 100 countries representing 70 per cent of the global economy have signed up to the methane pledge that US President Joe Biden was pushing at the climate summit to knock 0.2 degrees off a potential future temperature rise from this one pledge alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Australia didn't sign up to that pledge at the climate summit, and the opposition said they wouldn't sign up to it either, because of the power of the big gas corporations which are trying to fudge the fact that gas is as dirty as coal when you take into account the potent damage of methane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN Chief, Antonio Guterres, also pushed the no new coal pledge where countries from the developed and developing world have signed up to no new coal projects. As the campaign made clear: 'Moving away from coal is not a death knell for industrialization, but rather a much better opportunity for green jobs.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will enable a moratorium on new coal, gas and oil projects. It's a pretty reasonable proposition. It's not even about existing coal and gas projects. We're just saying don't open up new ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has the support of people in the country right across the political spectrum. People do not want us opening up new coal, oil and gas projects. We can have discussions in this place about what to do about existing ones, how to get out of them and support coal communities and workers through the transition, but everyone should be able to agree not to open up new ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a climate crisis. We've been told that we've got a few years to tackle this otherwise the window closes. And if that window closes, climate change becomes a runaway chain reaction and our kids and our grandkids live in a country where Australia heats by over three degrees in their lifetimes, where farming in the Murray-Darling Basin is going to become nigh on impossible in many parts of it, where whole cities will become uninhabitable during our kids' lifetimes, where droughts become a regular occurrence, as do bushfires. That is what is at stake, and this parliament, this government and this opposition cannot be the ones who stand by and listen to that science and pretend to accept it and then go and open up new coal and gas projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes sense not just if we care about our kids, and it makes sense not just from a climate point of view but from an economic one too. Global capital is quickly fleeing emissions intensive projects. These coal and gas projects need to run for three or four decades to be profitable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be no customers for coal and gas products in three to four decades. These assets will be stranded and the communities they leave abandoned will collapse and be forced to disperse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single coal and gas project from here on in is going to have great difficulty in securing finance, because banks and insurers are exposed to great reputational risk matched only by the degree of great financial risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People don't want to be customers of climate-denying institutions. Young, smart talent don't want to go and work for climate-denying institutions, and that's why increasingly, through a form of corporate socialism that I know the member for Goldstein loves and boosts every time he comes here, it is the public that is now having to put their hands in their pockets and give money to these big tax-dodging corporations to go and open up new coal and gas fields, because the banks won't touch them with a barge pole. So the member for Goldstein comes in here and says, 'Well, let's have the public subsidise these big tax-dodging corporations,' in a form of corporate welfare that most people are astounded even exists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat the point that I made at the start in conclusion. We have differences of views about how quickly we should get out of existing coal and gas, but everyone can surely agree that we shouldn't open up new coal and gas projects. No-one should be able to refuse this, and it's what the Australian people want.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians' trust in politicians and the political process is at an all-time low and for good reason, because, due to this country's weak political donation laws, voters don't even know who they are voting for. Indeed millions of dollars in political donations remain undisclosed each year, and Australians are routinely left in the dark about who's bankrolling their current and prospective elected representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To restore this dwindling trust, we urgently need significant reform, starting today with a deep overhaul of our political donations framework. We also need an independent federal integrity commission with teeth, more comprehensive media freedom laws and better protections for whistleblowers. This is what the community demands, and it should be something that receives bipartisan support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current disclosure threshold for political donations is $14,500, and obviously that is way too high. Moreover the current legislation also doesn't require donors to disclose if they donate just below the threshold multiple times. So in practice this means that, for example, a mining company can donate $14,499 multiple times without the public ever knowing about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed a report released this month by the Centre for Public Integrity showed that almost 30 per cent—or $1.38 billion—of donations received by the major parties since 1998 came from unknown sources. The recent figures released by the Australian Electoral Commission paint a similar picture, because, in the last financial year alone, more than $68 million of unexplained money flooded into the political parties, making up almost 40 per cent of all donations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making matters worse is that donation disclosures are only required once a year, meaning that up to 19 months can pass between a political entity receiving a donation and the public becoming aware of the donation. How on earth is the community expected to make informed decisions at the ballot box if they have no idea who is bankrolling candidates and parties? They can't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would add that the situation is even worse in Tasmania where we also have to endure the weakest state political donation laws in the country. Indeed, despite promises from the Tasmanian Liberal government to legislate for stronger transparency in political donations, both the Liberal and Labor parties went to the Tasmanian election last year backed by hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of dollars of dark money. Indeed in the last financial year the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party only disclosed the source of $260,000 out of $3.4 million—a startling 7.6 per cent. The Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party was not much better, only disclosing where 15½ per cent of its funding came from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the bill before the House today—the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Cleaning up Political Donations) Bill 2022—that would strengthen the transparency and accountability of political donations; starting with the lowering of the disclosure threshold to $1,000 and requiring aggregation so that multiple donations received from the same donor must be disclosed if the sum of all donations meets this threshold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also requires real-time reporting of donations to the AEC and, in particular, that political entities must provide a return to the AEC within two business days of receiving a donation over $1,000. The AEC is then required to publish this on their website as soon as reasonably practical, which is not a new concept, because several states already require real-time reporting of donations. Indeed if we debated this bill right now and it received bipartisan support, we could see such disclosure at the upcoming federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely voters have a right to know who's bankrolled a candidate or party before casting their vote, because the reality is that government policy is shaped by political donations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, when someone hands over many tens of thousands—or hundreds of thousands or millions—of dollars in donations, it comes with an expectation of a return on that investment. And very often in Australia these days the return on such investments is pretty good, to say the least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not irrelevant is that Pratt Industries donated a thumping $1.3 million to the Liberal Party during the last financial year, and afterwards the company was awarded a $10 million grant from the federal government from the Bushfire Recovery Fund. Make of that what you will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, donations from certain industrial sectors continue to severely impact policy and decision-making. For instance, I have no doubt that the reluctance of both major parties to implement meaningful gambling reform is a direct result of the huge money that they receive from that industry. In the last financial year alone, the coalition received over $540,000 from pro-gambling stakeholders and Labor received $516,000. And, again, this is just the money we know about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also hardly surprising that fossil fuel companies, backing large gas projects across Australia, gave nearly $1 million in political donations to the three major parties last financial year, a fact that came to light the same week the opposition committed to opening a new taxpayer funded gas-fired power station, a policy opposed by energy experts across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Politicians should be serving their communities, but instead they're bending over backwards to please the big donors. And big money in politics is a huge problem. Indeed, the Centre for Public Integrity reported that just 10 donors accounted for more than $4.2 million, or 23 per cent, of all political donations in the last financial year. That's why this bill implements a cap of $50,000 on the total amount any one donor can donate during an electoral cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also places a cap on the total amount that candidates and parties can spend on election campaigns, because parliamentarians should be elected on their policies, their values and what it is they can offer their community. Instead, our current system facilitates elections based on who has the biggest war chest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians would remember that Clive Palmer spent an absurd $80 million on the last federal election, and it has been reported that he intends to surpass this at this year's election. This blatant threat to attempt to buy the outcome of an election is something that all of us should be taking very seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, politicians and parties should not be accepting donations from sectors whose business causes direct harm to Australians. That's why my bill prohibits donations from fossil fuel entities, gambling companies, liquor companies and the tobacco industry. It also increases the penalties for corporations who breach electoral laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And finally, my bill expands the definition of a gift to include any expenditure that benefits a party, such as the 'Love Your Local' campaign we saw from the poker machine industry during the 2018 Tasmanian state election. It also captures money spent to attend political fundraisers and functions to minimise payment for access to politicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I urge all members to support this bill, because the community is crying out for reform, and it's way beyond time politicians focused on the public interest, not their self-interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge my member of staff Millie von Stieglitz for the remarkable job she has done preparing what is quite a complex bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

As an Independent, transparency and integrity are at the heart of what drives me and the people who put me here. Political access and influence should never be for sale. I'm proud to disclose the names and the amounts of every single donation I receive above $1,000 every financial quarter. That includes smaller cumulative donations from the same person that, together, total over $1,000. I'm also committed to disclosing the names of anyone who cumulatively donates more than the Australian Electoral Commission threshold of $14,500 within five business days. This bill would hold us all to a similar standard.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The publication of AEC returns earlier this month show how urgently we need to reform political donation laws. A recent analysis by the Centre for Public Integrity found that over $1 billion in financial contributions, or about 35 per cent of all donations going to the major parties, came from unknown sources in the last two decades. What's more concerning is that Australians will have to go to the ballot box none the wiser on what donations the major parties have received since they filed their returns.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this motion today, I wish to note, acknowledge, thank and urge. I want to note the very important decision from the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal on 25 January, making a recommendation to government relating to recognition of the fallen—those who make the ultimate sacrifice—and those who are injured and wounded in service. Of course, I want to acknowledge the significant 25-year campaign by Kay and Kerry Danes of Alexandra Hills in my electorate, who since 1996—12 June, to be precise—have campaigned for the result that was released by the tribunal on 25 January. Of course, I wish to thank every veteran family that made a submission and every veteran family that was part of these discussions—260 of them in 2021. Of those, 70 made verbal submissions to this inquiry. And I urge my government and every future government to do everything possible to bring this proposal to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, it won't have passed your notice that 25 years is a very long time, and it does reflect the reverence Australia holds for its honours and awards and the importance it attaches to them. Those 25 years have been incredibly frustrating for those who campaigned. I joined this campaign in 2008, when a former coalition colleague and former Assistant Minister for Defence said to me as he retired and completed his term, 'If there's one thing you should continue doing, it is this fight for recognition.' I want to make it very clear what this is. We are proposing that, in line with other Western economies and allied nations, there be a tangible form of recognition for the next of kin of those who have served in active service and made the ultimate sacrifice or been injured or wounded, whether physically or emotionally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about these matters, this is not in any way to disparage the current system but to recognise that historically there was a time when a mothers medal was sent to the next of kin as listed in the enlistment papers of service personnel. That finished in September 1945. From that period of imperial medals, we then moved to Australian medals, and it's this scope that the tribunal has considered. The recommendations—if you will forgive me as I attempt to distil them—were that we should look at a medal directly for the next of kin and for anyone who is identified as next of kin—potentially more than one person—and that a next of kin medal be worn on the left by the genuine next of kin. Veterans' medals, as everyone would know, are worn on the right by their family members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the additional question is: can the medal order of wear clearly and tangibly demonstrate that this sacrifice has been made? At the moment, the medals represent the service given by the individual, but they don't recognise the sacrifice, and this comes in many different forms. A clasp, for those not initiated in these matters, is often a horizontal bar that appears on the cloth part of the medal. It is very tiny in some cases, but it is very noticeable and of extraordinary importance to those who understand the medal order of wear. The point of this clasp is to make it possible, when those medals are worn in perpetuity by family, to see at a single glance not only the service but the sacrifice. If you think about being at an RSL and approaching the families of veterans, the proposal is that, with one single glance, one can see that the sacrifice has been made, and an appropriate way of engaging or entering into a conversation with that family becomes all the more possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's important because, if we look at the numbers of Australians who have fallen or been injured or wounded, the numbers are extraordinary. Keep in mind that the recommendation goes back to September 1945. Few of us in this place or beyond these walls would know that 98.4 per cent of Australia's fallen fell before that date. They currently have imperial awards, for which the tribunal is unable to make a recommendation. It surprises me that there wasn't some recommendation to this effect. While it cannot formally be done, additional work can be done by this place to ensure there is continuity back to 1885, when the first person fell in the service of this country, in the Sudan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we think about the historical tale of Australia—from Sudan to the Boer War, to the trenches of World War I, to Beersheba, to the Rats of Tobruk, to Kokoda, to all the places of World War I's Western Front, to WWII service in the air, on water and on land—so many of these great historical battles are currently not able to be recognised with this clasp or medal, if we go ahead purely with this recommendation. This motion today contains a two-part recommendation—first of all, that we urge government and the entire community to look at the recommendations from 25 January and continue to be part of this consultation process. But with 98 per cent of our fallen holding imperial awards it's also important to recognise this may require an approach from this nation to Her Majesty for permission to include a clasp so we can treat all medals equally, back to the first fallen. I think it's incredibly important that we don't have clasps only for 1945 going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have expressed views on the mothers medal. Sadly, as I understand, they were sent in the post office to be collected by next of kin. While that would seem an incredibly hardhearted instance for us now, that shows the reality of how things were at the time. Many families didn't appreciate the mothers medal as much as they should have. But one would also agree if we can start the medal from that moment forward there is no duplication, but it is the clasp that is important because that sits on the medals themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This two-part recommendation of this motion is for everyone—not just this parliament, not just the veteran community. Remember, many of them made recommendations that may have differed quite significantly from what was recommended. We would ask those veterans to continue conversations in RSLs and with service personnel all around the country, on bases, here and overseas, because this is a very important step. It is incredibly important to finally capture, in a tangible sense, the full service and sacrifice of our service personnel. I'm utterly delighted that, finally, we have reached this stage. But it is not the end of the journey. There is still potentially 12 to 18 months of further conversation if and when this is to proceed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be incomplete of me not to make a passing observation that, through the 15 years I've been involved in this campaign and the 25 years since Kay and Kerry Danes picked up this challenge, with 50,000 people filling out petitions, there was a decision to develop a pin for the three arms of the armed forces in place of the medal. This was an important step, but it is only halfway there, and these pins have been presented. But I'm disappointed that in many cases these pins may well have been an effort to stymie the ultimate campaign for appropriate medal recognition. These are strong words that I put today in this motion, but we worked extremely hard with chiefs of the Defence Force over this time, with varying levels of success, and these pins began being presented internally by Defence without notifying the government of the day. I think that's incredibly disappointing—that it was done by press release. It was only because I stumbled upon an inbox press release in the minister's office that I was able to notify the Prime Minister that these pins were being presented without the Prime Minister being aware. That was fixed within one hour, and the Prime Minister presented the pin that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This wasn't the greatest day in the history of this story, but, ultimately, I think the right thing happened. By supporting the recommendations of this report, we are allowing continued veteran contribution. I once again thank Kay and Kerry Danes and quote Kerry in particular, a 42-year Special Air Service Regiment veteran: 'I'm delighted with this recommendation from the tribunal. I feel we are very close now to a tangible result.' He, like all of us here, would thank every veteran family who, with the most painful memories of service in many cases, have made sure that, historically, not only service but sacrifice is appropriately recognised.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  I'm pleased to support this motion and the sentiment behind it. Recently, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal recommended the creation of a new class of medals and clasps which recognises the loss suffered by families of Australian Defence Force personnel killed or seriously wounded as a result of their service. This followed a referral of the matter to the tribunal in January last year by the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its report on the inquiry, the tribunal noted that Australia, through the Order of Australia and the Australian defence honours and awards system, already recognises the services of ADF members. In addition, Australia recognises the wounding, injury or death of such members in a variety of essential ways—for example, through health care, income support, compensation, family support services, bereavement pins and memorials. However, the inquiry considered that none of these consequences of service are reflected in the present medallic forms of recognition, none expressly convey the gratitude of the nation for individual sacrifice and none provide a suitably solemn and individual emblem of that gratitude. The tribunal therefore recommended that it is timely, if not incumbent, for Australia to initiate such an expression of its gratitude to members and their families. This would provide a tangible and readily recognisable expression of national gratitude for the sacrifice of ADF members killed or suffering a serious wound, injury or disease in or as a result of their service, and that of their families, and would do so in a way that allows existing defence honours and awards to better tell the story of that service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this motion recognises the strong advocacy of former Special Air Service Regiment Warrant Officer Kerry Danes and his wife, Dr Kay Danes, including through a petition that attracted around 45,000 signatures. Mr Danes launched his campaign several years ago, following the tragic Black Hawk helicopter collision during an army exercise in Townsville in 1996, which resulted, tragically, in the deaths of 18 soldiers. He has made the point that telling a story is important to our nation. Our existing defence honours and awards systems tell the story of where our personnel served and for how long, but, for those killed in service both overseas and at home in response to emergencies, conflict and disasters, we do not officially personalise their sacrifice and conclude their record of service. Mr Danes therefore proposed a clasp on these individuals' campaign or service medals which would complete the story of personal service and sacrifice. After all, there are precedents overseas, as the member for Bowman said, and we should recognise them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian soldiers have argued that there should be something similar to the Purple Heart for ADF personnel killed or wounded in action. But it should also recognise the families for their service and sacrifice, and I want to acknowledge also the advocacy of my colleague the member for Solomon on this issue and thank him very much, because, alongside the member for Bowman, he has been a strong advocate for special forces and Afghanistan veterans, as well as for veterans' mental health and for victims of abuse in the ADF. Thank you, Luke, for the work you've done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, those advocates and Labor urge the government to stand up on behalf of and for former ADF personnel and their families. The government has not always done this, firstly, in the response to the Brereton war crimes report, which had a terrible effect on the mental health of our current and former personnel. Secondly, tragically, the Morrison government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to a royal commission into defence and veterans' suicide. We know that many defence personnel have been medically discharged, have suffered mental health issues and in some cases have, tragically, taken their lives. I would encourage everyone to cooperate with the royal commission. I know that the Sydney hearings are happening today. I would encourage veterans and their families to engage with the royal commission. Some sort of recognition of the impact of service and the sufferings would play a therapeutic role for veterans and their families. This is a decision which I'd ask the government to take up on the recommendation of the tribunal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to thank the many veterans and their families for their sacrifice, and for the submissions that they've also made. I note that the awards tribunal saw hundreds of submissions and individuals. There are 220 individuals and groups who have made submissions to that inquiry. I urge the government to not procrastinate, to engage consultatively, to accept the advice of the umpire and to do the right thing by these veterans and their families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282306" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  Inscribed in the wall of the War Memorial are the words: 'No greater love has any man than to lay down his life for a friend.' They're very solemn words and they strike to the heart of every veteran and every person who has ever served—and every person who has lost anyone as a result of that service. I want today to acknowledge all the young Australians who worked up the courage to finally go into a recruiting office and raise their hand and swear by oath or affirmation that they'll put their life on the line for the defence of their country. They raise their right hand and they swear an oath to Australia, its people, its government, its Queen, her heirs and successors according to law, so help me God. Once that solemn pledge has been made, then that young Australian's life changes, and it changes in a very profound way. Veterans and those who are serving will understand exactly what I mean. I don't have the words to articulate the degree of soul-searching that happens prior to making that decision to make that pledge. We then take them to their recruitment training establishments at Kapooka or Cerberus or Edinburgh at the Australian Defence Force Academy or the Royal Military College, and there we teach them, we ingrain in them, we inculcate in them very deeply, very solemnly that their importance as an individual is secondary to that of the team and that the person on their right and the person on their left are the people they should make the ultimate sacrifice for. They would, in an instant, give their life for that person on the right or the left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many ask why, and the answer is simple: it's because that person on your right or your left would give their life for you. This is further inculcated, further strengthened, further reinforced as we take them through initial employment training, and then they finally march into their unit. Upon marching into a battalion, they see the battle honours that unit has received, and they feel and they smell and they taste the legends of generations that have gone before them. They understand the importance of the person on their right and on their left. Then, we, as a nation, put them in harm's way. We send them to the most dangerous places on the planet, and there they're required to engage the enemy by whatever means that might look like. But, ultimately, they're willing to put their life on the line for their mates, for their unit, for their country and for their mission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the funerals come as a result of that. I've spoken in this place before about what it means, and those that have attended a military funeral will understand the significance and the solemn feel that that portrays to everybody that's involved. At the conclusion of one particular funeral, which I'll never forget until the day I die, I was required to pass the Australian national flag to a next of kin, as is the tradition. I'll never forget the look in that mother's eyes as she took that flag, and in this place of words I'm lost for the words that describe what I felt that day. I wanted to bring that young bloke back. I wanted to hug her. I wanted to have the words that would ease her pain. And I didn't. I felt guilty that I, as part of the leadership team, had taken her son away. I still feel guilty. I still feel inadequate. I still feel as if there were words that I should have said that I couldn't, and I'm sure that there are many people in my position that want to say those words and can't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let this remind people of those words that can't be said. Let this remind people of the tears that we shed in private. Let this remind people of the ultimate sacrifice that is paid in defending our nation and its people. If we can do nothing else for those that make that ultimate sacrifice, we can do this: we can remember them. We must never forget them. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  I thank the member for Bowman for bringing this forward. He approached me some time ago—years ago—about this issue. It must be said it was in a typically weird way, but, nevertheless, I thought it was something very worthwhile supporting. I got behind it and have been advocating for it since. I thank the member for Blair for his acknowledgement of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get into the substance of this motion, I want to make a quick comment about the service at the War Memorial and the Last Post ceremony we have at the start of each parliamentary year. I was frankly disgusted at the level of turnout from politicians, federal members, in this place. There would have been 15, 16 or 17 federal representatives—MPs and senators. There should be four ranks of members of parliament and senators, people who represent Australians, at that one service that kicks off the parliamentary year. It's one hour of your time to acknowledge all those that have laid down their lives for our country before you get on with the rest of the year and the politics and the carry-on. We do important work here, yes, but you only have to give up one hour for that Last Post ceremony to say, 'For this calendar year and our efforts in the parliament, we will remember those that gave their lives for our freedom.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What it will also do, members in place, when you attend that Last Post ceremony and look up at the tens of thousands of names of those that have gone before us, is remind you to not be so flippant about war. It will remind you that war is a serious business and is paid for in the blood of patriotic men and women of this country. When you launch a pre-election campaign with megaphone diplomacy, talking tough, just remember that this country will always stand up for its values and its principles. We won't take a backwards step. But needless and careless actions and flippant references to war should be thought about deeply. That Last Post ceremony gives all honourable members the opportunity to reflect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the work of Kerry and Kay Danes in bringing the work that led to the inquiry forward. I served with Kerry for a short time in Timor-Leste. He's a great man who has done a lot, as has his wife, Kay. I worked closely with her to try and get the interpreters of Australian veterans and some of the embassy security guards out in that shambolic withdrawal from Afghanistan. They are good people, as is Andrew Sloan, who does a mountain of work to assist veterans every day. He did a lot of work on this campaign that led to the inquiry that has now given us recommendations. I want to acknowledge and thank Ray and Pam Palmer, who lost their son, Scotty. He was Territory born and bred. He was lost in Afghanistan with the commandos. Ray and Pam have been a big supporter of this push to get some sort of medallic recognition for those who have been either killed in service or injured or wounded in service. It's an important recognition, medallic recognition. As Ray often says, his son's name is up on the War Memorial wall, but it would be nice to have his son's medals accurately reflect the totality of his service and his sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I encourage the widest possible consultation about the recommendations. The ball's now in the government's court to do that work, and I wish them well in arriving at a good conclusion. As the member for Blair added, the royal commission is in Sydney and holding hearings, and my thoughts, prayers and solidarity are with all involved in that program.</span>

I've seen firsthand at Frankston High School, Elisabeth Murdoch College, Mt Eliza college, Patterson River Secondary College and across my electorate how great it is for children, their families and the community.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I rise to speak against the motion today, obviously, and I'd like to pick up where the member for Dunkley left off, speaking particularly on apprenticeships. This motion is yet another example of how Labor will disregard the facts in order to try and fit their political narrative. We see them do it time and time again. Nowhere is it more evident than in this motion when it comes to apprenticeships, because this government has long been a very keen supporter of apprenticeships. We understand that it's a vital part of education and skills training out there in the community. It's also a recognition that we, unlike the Labor Party, understand that it's not the government that is creating jobs in Australia. Rather, it is Australian businesses, and we need supportive policies that will help Australian businesses to grow their workplaces and grow job opportunities, especially when it comes to apprenticeships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a look at the member for Dunkley's own electorate, because I thought this motion must be driven from someplace. How bad is it on the ground in Dunkley that the member is so concerned particularly in terms of the way she was talking about apprenticeships? I had a look. In Dunkley, trade training apprenticeships are up 41 per cent since Labor was last in office. Apprenticeships are up 41 per cent in the member's own electorate, and such is her disgust that she has come in and moved this motion. We can only assume that, if we were to go back to a Labor government, as she would wish, we would see those apprenticeships fall again, because those are the policies of the party of which she is a part; whereas, under the coalition government, there are 41 per cent more apprenticeships in her own electorate, for the young people in the area of Dunkley, than there were when Labor last left office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's part and parcel of our government's JobTrainer fund: a $2 billion investment in skills supporting over 463,000 low-fee or no-fee courses in areas of skill shortages through TAFEs and registered training organisations. We are on track to make our target of almost half a million job-ready, skilled-up apprentices ready to take on the career of their choice. Let me say that again: half a million young Australians are going to be skilled up and ready to take on jobs because of the apprenticeships provided by the Morrison government. With our extended JobTrainer fund, as outlined in the budget, any Australian can enrol in qualifications in aged care, digital skills, disability care or child care and access a JobTrainer place regardless of their age, employment status or prior qualifications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are we supercharging the economy to provide more for jobseekers but we are actively investing in the industries of the future to ensure that we don't have skills gaps when it comes to priority workforces—in particular for qualifications in digital skills, aged care, disability care and child care. That is because we want young Australians to be able to pursue their dreams and pursue a job in their chosen field, but we particularly want to make sure that, as they complete their skills training, there are those important jobs for them to go into. In those industries where we might face skills shortages in the future, this presents an opportunity not only to provide them with the training that they need but also to make sure that those industries are catered for. So while Labor come into this place and talk down these important initiatives, talk down the state of the economy and talk down the skill training initiatives, over half a million Australians are going to be job ready because of the JobTrainer Fund. In fact, there will an increase of 40 per cent who are job ready in the electorate of the member who is moving this motion for political purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak quickly about the out-of-pocket costs of child care. Encouraging greater workforce participation as the economy recovers is particularly important for young families in my electorate of Ryan. Since we came to government, there are 280,000 more kids in child care than before as a result of us making child care more affordable and accessible. This is every family's own choice to make. But, as a government, we want to make sure that, if parents wish to get back into the workforce and access child care, childcare places are both accessible and affordable. So we will continue with these practical measures—not the political grandstanding of those opposite—to make sure we get Australians into apprenticeships and reduce the cost of living for Australian families.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I would like to thank my friend the member for Dunkley for bringing this important motion to the House today. There has probably never been a more important time for a motion like this. It looks at our education sector, which has had such a difficult time during this pandemic—whether it be early learning, primary school, secondary school or tertiary education. I'm so grateful to all the staff, students, families and advocates for education in my electorate who have taken the time, throughout the pandemic and now, to share their experiences with me. They know we need to do so much better in this country. They know that education really is our future and, at the moment, we're not hitting it as we should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of visiting Natasha and her team at the Eltham Child Care Cooperative in my electorate. Natasha and her team can only be described as absolute troopers—highly intelligent, very caring troopers who have soldiered through this pandemic making sure that our youngest children are cared for and supported. But, like early educators across Jagajaga, Natasha and her team are feeling let down. They are feeling like they have been abandoned. They are tired of having to adapt, often at short notice, to changing conditions of the pandemic, all the while trying to continue to provide the high-quality education that gives our children the best start to their learning journey. Natasha and her team, and all the early educators across our country, deserve better recognition, support and pay for what they do, but they're not getting it from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our families deserve so much better as well. Again, the pandemic has revealed to us just how important early education is for children and for parents. Parents are telling me they find the early learning system difficult to navigate. Childcare fees are too expensive. We're still in a situation where for many parents, particularly women, if they choose to go back to work for more than a couple of days, they're in a losing position; they actually spend more on child care than they earn in wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a Labor team that knows this current situation can't continue and is putting front and centre our plan for more affordable child care. It's a plan I'm really proud of—97 per cent of families will see cheaper child care under a Labor government and no family will be worse off. We take early learning seriously and we want to provide the real support to early educators and families alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Dunkley noted, when we talk about education, we also have to consider that not all students respond to traditional school programs. We need to have the flexibility that recognises this and supports students to find something that works for them. In my electorate, Open House in Macleod does a great job helping young people of secondary school age to unlock employment opportunities through hands-on work in crafts, mechanics, engineering and woodwork. This program from Open House has seen great success. Graduates of the program have gone on to apprenticeships or other forms of full-time work. I'm proud to have been able to support Open House through the Stronger Communities Program. Programs like this deserve more support and are really important to our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community, we know the value of TAFE as a key part of our education sector. We know how important it is to have courses and training available to people in our local area. We're lucky to have two wonderful Melbourne polytechnic campuses at Greensborough and Heidelberg West. But we also know what the Liberals think of TAFE. When the Liberals were last in power in Victoria, they cut TAFE funding so much that the Greensborough TAFE shut down. It was only with a Labor government back in place that the Greensborough TAFE was re-opened to ensure that people in Melbourne's north-east, in my electorate, had a local provider of skills and training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, Labor knows the value of TAFE. That is why a federal Labor government will provide 465,000 free TAFE places nationwide. This is a massive investment. I'm very much looking forward to what it will mean for people in my electorate, for young people, who have been dealt a really severe blow through this pandemic, to get on track, to get the skills and learning opportunities that will take them through their future and lead to well-paid secure jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building on our commitment to skills and training, an Albanese government will ensure that at least one in 10 employees for major government projects are apprentices, trainees or cadets. This is a commitment that will see tens of thousands of Australian workers given the training to set them up for their future. Education is so important. A Labor government will back it at every level.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I want to commend the member for Dunkley for putting this motion on the books today. It's a great opportunity to talk about a range of educational settings within my electorate. We have an amazing TAFE college, GOTAFE, based in Shepparton in the Goulburn Valley. It is wonderful but it needs to have an enormous amount of money spent on the facility. We potentially need $100 million spent on GOTAFE and its five or six different campuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian state government has simply stopped spending money on our Shepparton campus. When you go inside and look at the motor mechanic, there are trucks there that they simply cannot get their bonnets off because they don't have enough headroom. When you're learning to be a mechanic, you need to have access to the electronics that enable you to dial into Berlin, and Berlin will then tell you what's wrong with the car. That's what the modern mechanic needs. You can't get that sort of training in Shepparton, because the state government won't invest in the TAFE college to provide not world-leading but basic training to be a mechanic. We need a state government that stops talking about the rubbish and starts supplying some funding so that these TAFE colleges have the correct facilities. We know that demand for apprentices is at an all-time high right now, and all those apprentices are getting half their wages paid by the federal government. Again, the Victorian state government can talk this rubbish up; however, it's the coalition that is helping them in every way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greater Shepparton Secondary College, which is also a member of Hands on Learning, is one giant school that the Victorian state government built for Shepparton. So there's only one government secondary school in Shepparton. The thought is that that school would potentially need a trade school added to it and a smaller campus for children who come from a region with a small primary school, who would do better in a smaller setting rather than be forced to go to school with 2,500 students. So we might need a slightly different nuanced approach. We all know why Greensborough TAFE had to shut down. We also know that the truth behind that is that the state Labor government at the time privatised registered training organisations and made the TAFE colleges ridiculously too expensive. Effectively, it's their own policies that have led to these outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of the member for Dunkley's motion goes to Hands on Learning. I want to congratulate the people behind this amazing educational facility. Many schools have adopted Hands on Learning: in Victoria, 98 schools; in Queensland, 10 schools; in New South Wales, eight schools; and in Tasmania, 14 schools. In Shepparton we have Gowrie Street Primary School, along with the Greater Shepparton City Secondary College. In Echuca we have the Echuca Primary School, the Twin Rivers School, the River City Christian College and also St Joseph's College. Nathalia's primary school also has Hands on Learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunity for those kids who are struggling academically to go and learn in a different fashion often means going out to a shed at the back of the school; learning how to work in a team; learning how to make things, using their hands; being tutored by potentially tradies, sometimes retired tradies. It's an opportunity for these kids to develop their self-esteem, to work in a team so that they can effectively take that new learning, that new structure, and get the confidence that they need. So while the setting for Hands on Learning may be in some building out the back, it's a front for this opportunity to develop these skills within the individuals in a different way to sitting in the classroom and learning in the same way that 70 or 80 per cent of students learn. This is a different way of learning, but it's just as critical, just as important, and the outcomes are stunning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would urge our government, our ministers to look at this as a way of continuing to grow Hands on Learning. Victoria is obviously doing a great job, but maybe some of the other states could pick up the running with Hands on Learning.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I rise to support the private members' motion moved by the member for Dunkley, and commend her for bringing this to the attention of the House. All Australians, wherever they grow up, deserve the best shot at the education, skills and training opportunities that we have to offer. My late dad was a builder, an engineer and a TAFE teacher. He often called TAFE the elevator in life; training was what gave him the chance that no-one else in his family had had. Unfortunately, this isn't the reality for many young Australians, including people in the community I represent on the Central Coast of New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Central Coast is one region—that's how locals talk about our community—and that's how it should be treated by this government, but it's not, and this is especially true when it comes to education and training. Over the past eight years the Morrison government has cut more than $3 billion from vocational education and training. This has made it harder for people in my community to take up a trade, to get a traineeship and to get the skills that they need. It has led to a growing skills crisis across the coast. Young people tell me the courses they need are only available outside the coast, at Tighes Hill, near Newcastle, or Ryde, near Sydney, and that the cost of travel on top of course fees makes it hard to finish their training. After close to a decade of funding cuts, there are now 231 fewer apprentices in Dobell. That's close to a 10 per cent drop, and it's impacting people looking for work and employers trying to recruit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year I held a manufacturing roundtable where I heard from local businesses about the challenges they were facing. Most of them said there were jobs available, but there was a shortage of skilled workers to fill them. These are businesses like the Borg group, which has a strong history of manufacturing on the Central Coast. Grant from Borg told me they currently have 75 apprentices across 10 different trades, but they're struggling to fill positions in certain trades, like industrial painting, fitting and machining and other metal trades. If the locals in my community had access to quality, affordable training close to home, businesses like the Borg group would be able to fill those positions and young people would be able to gain the skills they need for a steady job and a good career, which would boost local jobs and our local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People on the north end of the coast are also being prevented from accessing the education and training they deserve because of where they live. Just recently the government announced the next round of its Commonwealth Scholarships Program for Young Australians, designed to help people take up a trade or an apprenticeship. These scholarships are available to people in a few hand-picked regions across the country, including Gosford in New South Wales—just south of my electorate. But the north end of the coast has been completely excluded from this program. As I said before, the Central Coast is one region, and young workers in my community could use a scholarship like this to upskill and find more secure work. They shouldn't be left behind just because they live 40 minutes north of Gosford. It's unfair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people living outside big cities have always struggled to get a fair shot at training and employment opportunities, and that has only been heightened during the pandemic. At the peak of COVID, when work was scarce, there were higher numbers of young people looking for work on the north end of the coast, so it makes no sense to exclude them from this program. I ask the Prime Minister: Why? Why are young people on the north end of the Central Coast being overlooked and left behind again and again by this government? Every young person, wherever they're born, wherever they live or wherever they grow up, deserves a fair shot at quality education and training that is close to home and affordable, that will provide them with the skills they need for a steady career and a good future. That's why Labor has planned for free TAFE. Under Labor we will provide 465,000 free TAFE places to Australians studying in areas where there is a skill shortage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I heard from the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia about the lack of training opportunities for pharmacy technicians—essential workers on the front line of the pandemic and critical to the supply, distribution and manufacture of lifesaving medicines. They are working in COVID vaccination clinics without ready access to the training they need. This training would support and encourage people to join industries in need of more workers, and would create jobs in regional communities like mine on the Central Coast of New South Wales in industries like trade and construction, energy and manufacturing. We have a plan to add 10,000 apprenticeships in the energy sector. Under Labor's plan we'll encourage businesses to take on more apprentices in the new energy sector by providing $100 million in funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only recently, with the member for McMahon, I visited a business, Twin Lakes Air and Solar, at Toukley. Mitch, from Twin Lakes, rang me this morning. They install air conditioning, solar panels and batteries up and down the coast, and land big contracts in Sydney and Newcastle. Businesses like Twin Lakes, with refrigeration apprentices, have the potential to drive jobs and growth, and to make the coast and other regions outside of big cities powerhouses of renewable energy. Labor's Powering Australia plan will make that a reality. Under the Morrison government, under this Prime Minister, local businesses and local jobseekers are being left behind. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E3L" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  We gather to mark the 14th anniversary of the apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples. We do that, as we always do, here on Ngunnawal land. We pay respect to the Ngunawal people and to all Indigenous peoples of this continent. We honour the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their elders past, present and emerging. Today, around Australia, and indeed at sea and elsewhere, Indigenous Australians are serving in the Australian defence forces, keeping us safe. I thank them, along with all who serve and all those who are veterans for their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give my respects to the Minister for Indigenous Australians and the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians. Future generations of Australians will visit this building and see their portraits. But we have a different privilege—one that allows us to say that we serve with them. We also recognise Senator Dodson, Senator McCarthy, Senator Thorpe and Senator Lambie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are on a journey to make peace with our past. It's a difficult journey and it's an important one—to draw together the past, the present and the future so we can truly be one and free. We belong to a story from time immemorial—a continent that contends with us all and the work of building a strong, sovereign and vibrant democracy that gives us all a voice. But we don't seek to sugar-coat this story. We don't turn aside from the injustices, contentions and abrasions. That's what successful liberal democracies do. We must remember, if we are to shape the future do so wisely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as we do this at this time every year, we remember the stolen generations: children taken from their parents. I say it again: children taken from their parents. No parent, no child, could fail to understand the devastation of that, regardless of whatever their background is: children taken from their parents; families and communities torn apart again and again and again. With that trauma, disconnection and unquenching pain came a national shame and a deep wound: separated from country, from kinship, from family, from language, from identity, and becoming even strangers to themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourteen years have passed since we said sorry here in this place: sorry for the cold laws that broke apart families; sorry for the brutalities that were masked under the guise of protection and even compassion; sorry for believing that Indigenous people were not capable of stewarding their own lives; sorry for the failure to respect, to understand, to appreciate; sorry for the lives damaged and destroyed. So, on this day and every year since, we are right to remind ourselves of times past, not to reignite the coals of pain or to bring division where there are the beginnings of healing, but to be mindful of the lessons learnt, to turn again from the great Australian silence and towards each other, and to again say, 'We are sorry.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said when I spoke in support of the original motion here in this place, on the other side of the chamber, 14 years ago, sorry can never be given without any expectation of forgiveness, but there can be hope. I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">An apology … involves … standing in the middle ground exposed, vulnerable and seeking forgiveness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forgiveness is never earned or deserved. It can never be justified on the simple weighing of hurts and grievance. Such measures will never rationally tip the balance in favour of forgiveness. Forgiveness transcends all of that. It's an act of grace, it's an act of courage, and it is a gift that only those who have been wounded, damaged and destroyed can offer. I also said 14 years ago: 'Sorry is not the hardest word to say. The hardest is, "I forgive you."' But I do know that such a path of forgiveness does lead to healing. It does open up a new opportunity. It does offer up release from the bondage of pain and suffering that no simple apology on its own can achieve. And nor do I believe that such forgiveness is a corporate matter. It can only begin with the individual. And forgiveness does not mean forgetting, nor does it mean that there are not consequences for actions and the need for redress and restitution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a hard conversation. I know that Danny Abdallah, together with his wife, Layla, knows a lot about loss and grief, and they have begun this conversation with Indigenous community leaders through the i4give Foundation that they have established in memory of their children, Antony, Angelina and Sienna, and their niece, Veronique. Out of great tragedy and loss, there can rise hope, and I wish them all the very best for these conversations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our journey, though, continues. If the apology itself was a milestone in that journey, each anniversary has been a yardstick of how far we have travelled since. Up until last year, the process of Closing the Gap, with its targets and measures, was how we judged that distance. It was a process born of sincere resolve and intentions, with no lack of money or will or work. But, because of a misguided faith in telling over listening, our targets were unmet, our ambitions unfulfilled and partnership not achieved. So last year we shifted course, and together with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples—in particular the Coalition of Peaks led by Pat Turner—we made a new national agreement, a new partnership, a genuine partnership to drive change. So we now have a shared plan in place, one that addresses not just the very real actions and responsibilities of the Commonwealth government but also those of state and territory governments as well. If we are to ever close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, we must work together as equal partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the journey we're on now, and progress is being made. Ninety-three per cent of Indigenous children are now enrolled in early childhood education. That is an increase from 77 per cent in 2016. In just the last three years, 23,000 Commonwealth contracts have been awarded to Indigenous businesses, businesses like the ones we celebrated with members of this chamber only last Friday night at the annual Ethnic Business Awards. An example is Ben Schaber from Alice Springs, who turned his life around by getting out of prison, getting into a job, getting into a trade and now running his own specialised welding and engineering business in the Territory and providing the very same opportunities to other Indigenous Australians. Ben is an inspiration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was joined by Ray Pratt of DICE, who won this year's award. He leads a successful energy and electrical engineering business, powering up remote communities in the Territory. And there's Leah Cameron from Marrawah Law in Far North Queensland, where she's generating social impact for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There's James Curran from Moec water and energy, constructing pipelines across Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Indigenous owned and run businesses are getting the job done on Closing the Gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of that journey, though, also includes redress for the wrongs of the past. Early last year, I met with the Healing Foundation and survivors of the stolen generations, and I promised them that I would look at the very important issues of redress. In August last year, I was very pleased to keep this promise and announce a $378.6 million package for a financial and wellbeing redress scheme for living stolen generations members who were removed as children from their families in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, prior to their respective self-government, and the Jervis Bay territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In normal times, we look up to the glass galleries above us and see schoolchildren from across Australia. They come to Canberra to learn about the country and their place in it, to learn our story. They visit the parliament and learn about our freedoms, the War Memorial to learn about the price of those freedoms, the High Court to understand we're a country of the rule of law and Questacon and the various galleries to speak to their imaginations. But nowhere have we told the story of the heritage and history of this continent's Indigenous people in a way that it should be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in January, the government committed to establishing a new cultural precinct in the heart of the parliamentary triangle to be called Ngurra. 'Ngurra' is a word in many languages that means country, it means home and it means belonging. Ngurra, among the instruments and institutions of modern Australia, will be a home for Indigenous belonging, experience, knowledge and value in the heart of our nation. As well, it will be a promised resting place in the very heart of our nation's capital for our oldest stories. The proposal as put forward by AIATSIS—they have consulted on it and will continue to consult on it—has been adopted in its entirety by the government, including the budget that they have sought for it. This is another important step in our journey. It will tell stories long after all of us who are here have departed. It will speak to generations and generations, as the War Memorial has to so many younger generations now. It will tell those stories in truth and honesty, in compassion, in love, in patriotism and in pride for our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many more steps still. To this end, we continue the work of the Indigenous Voice Co-design to ensure it is truly a voice owned by Indigenous Australians from the ground up—relevant to local communities and connected to local communities—not from the top down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This anniversary will always be a day of poignant reflection, and I look forward to the contributions of the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Indigenous Australians and the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians. It's a poignant reflection that can again give birth to hope as well—hope for a reconciled nation, its people at one with their past and with each other and open to shaping their future together. That is what we continue to work for, and that is what we pledge ourselves to do once again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I begin by acknowledging the Ngunawal and Ngambri people and pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging, and also recommit, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, to the implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. I pay tribute to Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, whose own mother was part of the stolen generations and to my friend Senator Patrick Dodson, who is here with us today, who, as a boy, hid in the long grass of Katherine watching as the welfare officers and police took away his mates. I also pay tribute to our shadow minister Linda Burney, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, Senator Jacqui Lambie, Senator Lidia Thorpe and Senator Dorinda Cox. I welcome members of the stolen generations who have joined us here or are watching; we are humbled by your presence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The effects of those removals, that theft, still linger. That's why an apology had to be made and, just as importantly, accepted. As we were reminded last week, it takes great courage to come and face the institution that has failed you and failed you profoundly. That was the case 14 years ago when members of the stolen generations came to Parliament House to witness the apology. It was an apology they had waited so long to hear. It was an apology that had been promised to them after years of resistance and rejection, even by some on the day itself. Even in that unifying moment for our country there were some who turned their backs, but overwhelmingly it was a unifying moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What shines in our shared memory is the determination, the grace and the guts of those members of the Stolen Generation who were here for the apology. Kevin Rudd would later recall the fear among them as they entered through the Prime Minister's courtyard, and yet they came. That is courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the first order of business of the new government. It remains my proudest moment as a parliamentarian, and as the Leader of the House I was proud to put in place the practical arrangements necessary on that day. The speech which Prime Minister Rudd gave was a seismic act of catharsis. He turned an important page for all of us as he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he uttered the words, 'I am sorry on behalf of our nation,' our nation was lifted up. We cannot look to our future without reflecting on the past, because until a nation acknowledges the full truth of its history it will be burdened by its unspoken weight. We must acknowledge the wrongs, learn from them and look for ways of healing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Truth telling can be confronting, but it need not be grounds for conflict. It should be seen as the first step of finding grounds for resolution and moving forward as one. As Mick Dodson put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I know of no Indigenous person who told their story to the inquiry who wanted non-Indigenous Australians to feel guilty—they just wanted people to know the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a powerful statement from a great Australian. We should come to this process not armed for battle but with our arms open, our minds open, our hearts open, but we must also keep our eyes open. Until last year, this anniversary was also when we assessed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report, the annual catalogue of the chasms that still divide Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. Those chasms remind us that speeches that do not lead to action are a hollow, bitter undertaking. They remind us that we must all do better, every one of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The apology will always hold its special place in our national story, but as the start of a new chapter we have it within us to write that chapter. In an act of profound generosity and grace, we have been given the Uluru Statement from the Heart, a patiently extended hand, waiting for us to take it and go further as a nation. But now we should feel, within our own hearts, the insistent rhythm of Uluru's three generous requests: voice, truth, treaty. Labor is committed to all three—the voice to parliament enshrined in our Constitution, truth without which we can never be all that we can as a nation, and treaty emerging from the makarrata commission which Labor will establish. The apology faced the past, bringing us to the end of one journey and the beginning of a new one. Closing the Gap shows us the present and underlines the urgency of taking the next steps, and the Uluru statement shows us a fairer and a better future, a better future that is within our reach, a better future that encompasses all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My good friend the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs will speak shortly about the road ahead and how we can all walk it together.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="M3A" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Australians</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I begin by acknowledging the Ngunawal people on whose land we gather today and I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. I also acknowledge my Indigenous parliamentary colleagues: the honourable member for Barton, Linda Burney; Senator Patrick Dodson; Senator Malarndirri McCarthy; Senator Thorpe; Senator Lambie; and Senator Cox. We are few, but our numbers are growing, and the work we do here matters enormously. And I acknowledge the members and families of the stolen generations across this nation, no matter where they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday marked the 14th anniversary of the formal apology to the Stolen Generation offered by the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on behalf of the Australian government. For me, as a child of a mother of the Stolen Generation, to hear our government acknowledge the tremendous wrongs that were committed against our people was profound. The apology stopped the nation. It asked all Australians to imagine that feeling of loss, and it collectively affirmed that what happened should never happen again. Together we said sorry, and we are still sorry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The significance of being an Indigenous man delivering a ministerial statement in the national parliament to honour that apology 14 years later is not lost on me. My Indigenous colleagues and I are testament to the enduring strength and resilience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, of 65,000 years of culture, of 65,000 years of survival. While the acknowledgement of wrongdoing can ease some suffering, it will never remove it. Today those who were taken and their descendants are rebuilding. They're having families of their own, preserving and continuing culture, and protecting and nurturing country. They seek to repair the irreplaceable loss of love, community, culture, language and identity that was brought about through the actions of the policies which created the stolen generations. I will always continue to tell my story and my mother's, the story of how she spent years in Roelands mission near Bunbury in Western Australia, how she and her nine brothers and sisters were taken from their parents and split between three different missions, hundreds of miles apart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a story I've heard from other survivors. Over the past two weeks, I've visited the Northern Territory, Tasmania and New South Wales, and I've been humbled to connect with survivors of the stolen generations. I sat with them and listened. Yesterday, on the anniversary of the apology, I shared breakfast up in Newcastle with survivors of the Kinchela Boys Home: No. 11, Lester Maher; No. 12, Roger Jarrett; No. 28, Richard Campbell; and No. 36, Michael Wells. They were known only by number in the boys home; their identity and culture were torn away. We yarned and we shared our truths—the truth about what happened at Kinchela. The trauma experienced is, for some, unspeakable. For others, telling their story continues to be an important part of their healing. This is truth-telling. It's personal, raw, within living memory. It's a truth that we should never forget. That's why truth-telling is so vital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme, which will begin on 1 March, will be significant for Indigenous Australians removed from the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay. As well as the financial payments, the support package includes wellbeing support to ensure it is delivered in a survivor-focused, trauma-informed and culturally sensitive way. This morning I announced that, through this scheme, survivors will have access to free legal advice and free financial counselling from independent support services. The scheme will be guided by an external advisory body, co-chaired by the Healing Foundation and the National Indigenous Australians Agency, and comprising stolen generations representatives, organisations and trauma specialists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met the board this morning, and I know they will guide the implementation of this scheme with great dignity and respect for our people. Together with the schemes run by the state, it will be part of our national journey towards healing and reconciliation. The Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme is one way we ensure that the national apology delivered 14 years ago is not mere symbolism. Powerful words must be followed by practical action. The stolen generations lost their childhoods and their connections to family, country and culture. We cannot give back lost childhoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are being empowered to help shape and make decisions that matter in their lives. This acknowledges that governments don't always know what's best and that our strength lies in our people—a strength that is the bedrock of the oldest continuous living culture on this planet. Throughout my time in this place as Minister for Indigenous Australians, I've been most proud of our efforts to empower Indigenous Australians. Be it through the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, the development of an Indigenous Voice or the National Roadmap for Indigenous Skills, Jobs and Wealth Creation, I have set out to change the way Indigenous Australians work with their governments, not just here in Canberra but in every corner of our nation. We see this permeate through other states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday I met with the New South Wales Premier, Dominic Perrottet. Like our Prime Minister, he has committed his government to taking meaningful steps with a balance of powerful, symbolic measures backed by practical action that makes a real difference to people's lives: freeing the Aboriginal flag and flying it atop the Harbour Bridge; building Ngurra, the new cultural precinct in Canberra; removing barriers to economic development on Indigenous land and unlocking its potential; creating jobs and Closing the Gap. Indigenous Australians are, and must be, equal partners sharing and driving decision-making about the plans that affect us. By doing so, we can realise the aspirations we hold for ourselves, for our children and for our communities—for their health, growth, education, employment, economic independence and flourishing cultural wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the stolen generations, there is still more to be done. As I've travelled the country over the past two weeks, I've heard similar stories of Stolen Generation survivors still disconnected from their culture, from their land and from their people. Through no fault of their own, these people and, subsequently, their descendants were removed—culture interrupted and families disrupted. When they return to country and return to their culture, often without any proof of their removal, they've been subjected to questions from our own mob about who they are, what their heritage is and what place they have in the local community. We need to accept that that sense of place for some people may be where they were born, where they were taken from or where they were taken to, or now where they have chosen to put their roots in the ground since. Everyone has a place. Everyone has a home. It may be of our choosing; it may not be. The task for us, no matter their place, is to bring them home and welcome them home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, Lester, or No. 11, shared with me his journey and his loss of identity and place and how it affected him, his children and his grandchildren. He told me about how, when he reconnected with his family after years away, he was told that he 'spoke funny'. He told me how he found it hard to rebuild his family structure. He's still on that journey; his family are still on that journey. We need to do more to help Lester and survivors like him. Our organisations need to support them, not shun them. Our people need to support them. We need to include more than exclude, and to celebrate, not denigrate nor question. Rather than push them down, we need to embrace them, give them love and welcome them home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to parliament, there is great power in this place—this institution. Over the years, decades and generations to come, it must be used for good. Our people must be empowered to engage with the parliament and with government and to follow in the footsteps of Neville Bonner, as I and my Indigenous colleagues have done. In federal parliament, state and territory parliaments and local governments, we must work together and in partnership. This parliament said sorry 14 years ago. Since that day, we have strived to meet those words with actions. We will not always get it right, but the more we listen, the more we engage and the more we appreciate the better our actions and outcomes will be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many more of our people will leave their songlines here. Future generations will be in this place, and they will bring their voice to the cabinet. Their experiences, knowledge and understanding will continue to contribute and guide this great nation and its people. When we walk together, we have limitless potential. When we are one, we are strong. Again, I acknowledge all those who are still with us from the stolen generations, their families and all Indigenous Australians who aspire to a better future and better opportunities. Your survival makes us remember. Your strength makes us better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I acknowledge that this parliament sits, and I give this speech, on the lands of the Ngunawal and the Ngambri peoples, and I honour the ongoing contributions of their elders past and present to the world's oldest continuing culture. I thank the Prime Minister, the minister and my friend the Leader of the Opposition for their words today, and I recognise my dear friends Senator McCarthy and Senator Dodson, who are watching on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here to remember that speech given by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. I know that there are many Australians who remember that day with absolute clarity. I certainly do. They remember the way it felt and the way it made them think about our country and its future. It was not only a document or speech to parliament; it was a cultural moment shared by this country. It was, of course, also a speech in a place and time. It was a day of great ceremony. First Nations leaders and members of the Stolen Generation from around the country were here, in the galleries and on those chairs near the door. But there were no First Nations people seated among the members in that parliament. There was no First Nations member to give a speech to mark the first or second anniversary. It wasn't until the member for Hasluck arrived in 2010, more than a century after Federation, with his story and the story of his mother, that there was a First Nations member in this place—of course, after Senator Bonner in the other place. It would take another election for Nova Peris to join the Senate as the first First Nations woman ever elected to our parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should never leave unstated just how long the reconciliation journey has been in our country. The apology was not the work of one person only. It was not the sentence that ends the story. It was a way marker in a century of work—a marker that shows how far we have come, what we can achieve and how much further we have to travel. William Cooper, Pearl Gibbs, Jack Patten, William Ferguson, Aunty Marge Tucker and others—leaders who got us to the Day of Mourning—erected a marker, proud and tall. They weren't acknowledged as citizens at that time in this country, and they had to seek permission from the Board of Protectors to exercise basic human rights, but they got that marker up anyway. Charles Perkins and other freedom riders laid down another marker as they showed that ongoing discrimination was not a thing overseas; it was, in fact, here in our own country. With other leaders like Faith Bandler and Jessie Street, the light that they shone on their path helped us to find our way together to voting yes in the '67 referendum on counting Aboriginal people in the census. Sometimes the big markers are set by our country. At other times it's four people and an umbrella. That's how Michael Anderson, the late Billy Craigie, the late Bertie Williams and the late Tony Currie founded the Tent Embassy. Fifty years later, only Michael survives, but the Tent Embassy and its message remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty years ago, in a park in Redfern, Paul Keating understood the power of truth in our reconciliation journey. I was there. Crucially, that is a journey of imagination. Sometimes people find fiction is the entry to their imagination. In my inaugural speech in the New South Wales parliament, I spoke about the message of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Kill a Mockingbird</span> by Harper Lee, and the message was putting yourself in someone else's shoes, as the minister has told us about today. The member for Grayndler spoke about Senator Dodson hiding in the long grass, watching as the welfare officers took away his mates. Put yourself in the shoes of that little boy, not just in that moment but in the earlier moments of his life that meant he knew he'd need to run and hide—and the girl that helped you, Senator Dodson, in the first place. Imagine what it was like for those who had nowhere to run. Put yourself in the shoes of a three-year-old, wrapped in the love of a large family, to have that love ripped away. Put yourself in the shoes of parents loving, caring and now grieving. As Paul Keating said in that speech, these things could happen because of failure to imagine these things being done to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia likes to think it is better at imagining now, and in some ways it is—sometimes. Imagine what living in a remote community is like, with 15 or 20 people in a three-bedroom house. What that's like? Imagine not having enough RATs to go around when local services are failing because there aren't any staff to step up when those on the front line have to isolate, and when less than half of the community is vaccinated. Every day, I hold my breath and hope, because that failure could mean the end for far too many who carry our culture and language. Our elders are our libraries. They are our internet. They cannot be replaced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home </span>report shone a clear, unwavering light on truth that had been kept in the dark for too long. The truths spoken of were not things past; they were truths embodied in living people. John Howard did not see this as a moment for change. He saw the moment for change <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home </span>demanded as something to be weathered, not grasped. Determination is a great quality in a leader, but stubbornness is not. Three hundred and fifty thousand people walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and 300,000 marched in Melbourne. Australia was ready to set another marker down and march on together on our reconciliation journey. We had to hold our breath and wait because the Prime Minister would not let us breathe and was determined to hold us back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't until we chose a government and a leader that knew ignoring our past, ignoring the lived reality of so many, was not an option, that the country exhaled and that we could take the next steps in the journey of reconciliation. In 2008, we had a government and a leader that could see the world wearing another's shoes. I was really interested in hearing, Prime Minister, that you spoke in that debate. Australia chose a government that could imagine. As Paul Keating said, 'It seems to me that if we can imagine the injustice we can imagine its opposite.' And so Kevin Rudd apologised to the stolen generations for the hurt our country did to us, our families and our nation's soul. Last year, I spoke about Aunty May Robinson and how we fell into each other's arms in the foyer of the parliament. She was carrying a photograph of her mother as an eight-year-old girl. She said, 'Linda, I brought Mummy with me today.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The apology gave us the Closing the Gap strategy, our national acknowledgement that structural change is necessary—the Prime Minister spoke about that today—and our national commitment to achieve that change. The apology recognised that a moment of change demands that we step confidently forward together. It was a speech of truth that set us free to exhale. But it is what we do with that freedom that matters, as my friend the leader of the Labor Party said. The next steps of walking together are up to us. Another moment of change is here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru statement is clear and points us to our next steps. Voice, treaty and truth are all within our stride if we want to take them. Now is not the moment to rest. Now is the moment to stride on. The time is here to give First Nations people our voice in the decisions made about us. Do we think that our government could leave First Nations culture exposed to COVID? No. Would First Nations people be forced by overcrowding to isolate in tents and sheds? Will we still suffer the ongoing epidemic of suicide amongst our young people? A Labor government will not force this country to hold its breath again. We'll move on a referendum to get the Indigenous voice established in the Constitution. We will establish the makarrata commission for treaty and truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These steps in the Uluru statement are fundamental, necessary and urgent, but they are not radical. They do not arrive out of the blue. They are not a storm to be weathered. They are the next steps in our reconciliation journey—a journey over a century long, a journey Aboriginal people started decades before we were counted as citizens. The apology recognised the journey we have taken. It recognised how far we have to go. It is up to us as a parliament, as a people, to resolutely take the next steps and lay down our own marker. We can do this. We must.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation"> SMITH:</span>  The Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, the APPF, brings together members of parliaments from throughout the Asia-Pacific region each year. Delegates discuss matters of interest and importance to the region and adopt formal resolutions across agenda topics. Australia has been an active participant in the APPF since its establishment in 1993 and this most recent meeting of the APPF was no exception. Along with myself as delegation leader, Australia was represented at APPF29 by the members for Lalor, Lindsay and Moreton and by Senator Van in the other place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The meetings of APPF29 took place in November and December 2021. While the forum was hosted by the Republic of Korea, the continued spread of COVID-19 variants across the world saw the meeting take place virtually for the first time in APPF history. The overarching theme for APPF29 was the role of parliaments in strengthening resilience in the post-COVID-19 era. The agenda for the APPF covered political and security matters, economic and trade matters, and regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. The APPF meeting of women parliamentarians was another important item on the agenda. Australia participated in each of these sessions and prepared draft resolutions on the following topics: identifying ways to ensure a gender-sensitive crisis response after the COVID-19 pandemic; strengthening multilateralism and addressing issues based on rules; accelerating the digital economy and enhancing productivity; the role of parliaments in balancing disease control, economy and human rights; and ideas for interparliamentary cooperation. The Australian delegation worked closely with other delegates to negotiate and, where possible, combine the proposed resolutions on each topic into a single version. At the final plenary session, a total of 13 resolutions and a joint communique were adopted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the opening session of APPF29, I announced I would be stepping down from my role as president of the APPF. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as president since 2020, and I know that the APPF will continue to be a vital institution for our region. I also want to take this moment to thank member nations for electing me to this office and, in particular, thank my friend and colleague from the Japanese Diet, Hirofumi Nakasone, for nominating me for the presidency. Subsequent to my announcement, the APPF executive committee agreed to changes to the role of president, with the functions of this role being transferred to the annual meeting chair. These changes will ensure the APPF is in a strong position to continue to provide our region with an important platform for years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea for their successful delivery of the first virtual APPF. I would especially like to thank my fellow Australian delegates for their contributions to APPF29 in representing and promoting Australia's interests and contributing to the working groups and plenary sessions. The virtual meetings were held at a busy time of the year for members, and my colleagues' contribution to the APPF reinforces the importance of the APPF to our region.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to ensuring the ongoing improvement of Australia's federal courts and tribunals. It is with pleasure that I introduce the Courts and Tribunals Legislation Amendment (2021 Measures No.1) Bill 2021 (the bill), which primarily seeks to improve the administration of the federal courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The bill does not introduce fundamental changes to the way our legal system operates. Rather, it represents some incremental changes that will streamline and clarify existing processes in the federal courts and the AAT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, this bill amends the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Administration Act 1999, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Admiralty Act 1988, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1989, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1962, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Circuit Court Act 1999, the Federal Circuit and Family Court Act 2021, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985, the Judiciary Act 1903, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. The bill would also repeal the Nauru (High Court Appeals) Act 1976.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government aims to make merits review through the AAT accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick. To this end, this bill will amend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Administration Act, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the Paid Parental Leave Act, the Social Security (Administration) Act, and the Student Assistance Act to streamline and harmonise the practices and processes of divisions within the AAT. Amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act will also address minor technical and administrative issues within the existing act. Amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act will require consequential amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also make minor and technical amendments to the Judiciary Act, which will amend inconsistencies in terminology between the Judiciary Act and the High Court Rules, and to prescribe forms by practice direction rather than retaining them in the High Court Rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes minor amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act, the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act, the Family Law Act and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Act to clarify that hearings conducted remotely using videoconferencing technology are exercised in 'open court'. The bill also amends the Judiciary Act to clarify that a court shall be taken to be exercising federal jurisdiction in a proceeding in the state or territory in which the proceedings commenced. These amendments are appropriate to remove any doubt as to the validity of hearings across the federal courts being undertaken remotely, particularly since the broader use of remote hearings since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes amendments to the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 (FSI Act). Under international law, foreign states are entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of other countries in certain circumstances. In Australia, this immunity is governed by the FSI Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments clarify the application of the FSI Act to ex parte proceedings following the High Court's consideration of the issue in Firebird Global Master Fund II Ltd v Republic of Nauru in 2015. In Firebird, the court held that the provision in the FSI Act relating to judgements in default of appearance does not apply to ex parte proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill clarifies the application of the FSI Act to ex parte proceedings to ensure that foreign states are afforded appropriate procedural immunities, and reduces the risk that an Australian court could register a foreign judgement against a foreign state in circumstances where Australia is obliged to afford that foreign state immunity under international law. Furthermore, the bill similarly extends these procedural protections to proceedings relating to the recognition or enforcement of a foreign award against a foreign state pursuant to the International Arbitration Act 1974.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also clarify that the Admiralty Rules 1988 are rules of court and apply certain provisions of the Legislation Act 2003 so as to exempt the rules from sunsetting, but require that they be registered and published. This aligns the treatment of the Admiralty Rules with the rules of the federal courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would repeal the Nauru (High Court Appeals) Act. The Nauru (High Court Appeals) Act was enacted to give effect to the agreement between the Australian government and the government of the Republic of Nauru for appeals to the High Court of Australia from certain classes of decisions of the Supreme Court of Nauru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement was terminated on 13 March 2018 while still providing for appeals and applications for leave instituted before the date the agreement was terminated to be heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All relevant appeals and applications for leave instituted before the agreement's termination have concluded. Accordingly, it is appropriate for the Nauru (High Court Appeals) Act to now be repealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this bill represents the government's enduring commitment to ensuring that our legal system is fit for purpose. In particular, the bill will improve the efficiency and operation of our federal courts and the AAT.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were three aspects of the original bill that Labor did not support, which we amended successfully in the Senate. To her credit, the Attorney-General and her office worked constructively and in good faith with me and my office in relation to Labor's concerns. In the interest of getting this bill through the parliament, the government agreed to two of Labor's amendments. Despite the government's opposition, Labor's third amendment also succeeded in the Senate. I understand that the government has taken the sensible and pragmatic view to now accept that amendment, too. I would like to thank the Attorney-General for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first aspect of the bill we did not support related to the role of the Governor-General in the appointments process for members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Currently, a person may not be appointed as a deputy president or as a member of the tribunal, unless, in the opinion of the Governor-General, the person has special knowledge or skills relevant to the duties of a deputy president or member. The original version of the bill would not have changed the fact that appointments would still be made by the Governor-General, but it would have amended the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to require the minister, as opposed to the Governor-General, to form an opinion as to whether a person has special knowledge or skills relevant to the duties of a deputy president or member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this change was unlikely to have any significant practical impact on the appointments process for tribunal members, the government failed to make a case for why such a change was necessary or desirable. Given the Morrison government's shameful record of appointing almost 80 Liberal Party associates and former Liberal Party politicians, staffers and donors as members to the tribunal, Labor senators refused to support an amendment which, even just at the level of perception, further undermined the independence of the appointment process. Senator Watt moved an amendment to remove that aspect from the original bill in the Senate. That amendment was successful, despite the government's opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of further context, it is difficult to overstate the damage that the Morrison government has done to public confidence in and the integrity of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Liberals have handed at least 79 jobs on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to Liberal mates—that is at least 79 former Liberal Party staffers, failed Liberal Party candidates, Liberal Party donors and members who've been given secure and very highly remunerated jobs on the tribunal, and, for many of them, their only qualification seemed to be a Liberal Party membership card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Full-time members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are paid between about $200,000 and $500,000 a year, and it's basically impossible for them to lose their jobs, even if they never turn up for work or are incompetent when they do turn up. Based on data provided by the tribunal, we know that some full-time members, people who are receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in salary, have been doing no work. We know that many other full-time members have been doing very little work, finalising fewer than 25 applications a year. We also know that, as a result of potentially unlawful remuneration policies adopted by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, many part-time members of the tribunal are being paid tens of thousands of dollars more than full-time equivalents. The Auditor-General looked into this, and the tribunal has undertaken to update its remuneration policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The poor record of a small number of tribunal members undermines the excellent work of many great members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, some of whom are former Liberal Party parliamentarians and staffers. Let me be clear: membership of a political party is not a disqualification for appointment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The issue is that the Morrison government has treated membership of the Liberal Party as the only qualification for appointment. How else can one explain the appointment of a man like Anthony Barry, who's a former Liberal Party media adviser turned big-tobacco lobbyist who reportedly boasted about dropping out of law school and who continued to work as a lobbyist long after he was appointed to the tribunal, or the appointment of John Griffin? He's another senior Liberal Party aligned lobbyist who continued to advise the Liberal Party on 'state and federal election campaigns as a senior political strategist and campaign adviser while he was a member of the tribunal'. It became so bad that former High Court Judge Ian Callinan, who was hand-picked by the former Attorney-General to conduct a review of the tribunal, felt the need to recommend that all future appointments be made on the basis of merit. You would hardly think you needed to recommend that, but former High Court Judge Ian Callinan, in his review of this tribunal, said that that needed to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before, it saddens me greatly to see the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, a great innovation in Australian administrative review processes, diminished in this way by this rotten government. Every year tens of thousands of Australians rely on the tribunal to conduct an independent review of decisions by Commonwealth ministers and public servants, decisions that can have major and sometimes life-altering impacts on people's lives. Age pensioners, NDIS participants, veterans—this government cares more about the interests of their little circle of mates than about those Australians. For the Morrison government, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is there to serve the interests of the Liberal Party and its mates, not the interests of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning back to the bill, the second aspect of the original bill we did not support in the Senate was the extension of the same protections and immunities to Immigration Assessment Authority reviewers as are currently provided to High Court judges and members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Labor has long held concerns about the so-called fast-track assessment process under the Immigration Assessment Authority. That process is neither fast nor fair, and this parliament should not endorse any measure which even implicitly suggests that the fast-track process is somehow the equivalent of or even similar to a normal judicial or tribunal process. Senator Watt moved an amendment to remove that part of the bill, and that amendment was successful. I note that in the interests of getting this bill through the parliament the government agreed to support that amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Labor senators opposed the amendment to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to allow the Federal Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to provide short-form reasons rather than detailed judgements where a decision dismissing an appeal does not raise any questions of general principle. That aspect of the bill was criticised by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, the Josephite Justice Office and Law Institute of Victoria on the basis that it would disadvantage unrepresented applicants, including those seeking review of refugee decisions. We shared those concerns, and so Senator Watt moved an amendment in the Senate to remove that aspect of the bill. In the interests of getting this bill through the parliament, the government agreed to support that amendment in the Senate. So, with Labor's amendments having passed the Senate, what we are left with is a good bill which makes useful, largely administrative and long-overdue amendments to various acts of parliament relating to federal courts and tribunals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can only imagine how many months and years this bill, or at least a version of it, sat in the former Attorney-General's to-do pile gathering dust, gathering dust under the long ignored <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@work</span> report, the exposure draft of the Commonwealth Integrity Commission Bill and departmental briefs on the nine or so judicial vacancies on federal courts. The list of urgent, unfinished business under the former Attorney-General was a long one. At the risk of damming the current Attorney-General with faint praise, I give her credit for bringing this simple but worthwhile bill forward to the parliament, and I commend the bill in its amended form to the House.

He would have turned 106 next month. He was a lover and a fighter. Bert loved ballroom dancing, and he was good at it. He won plenty of tournaments. He loved making music boxes. He made one for my little boy Jack. He loved talking—and boy did he have the gift of the gab!—and he loved Peggy, the woman he waltzed around the dance floor.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he was also a fighter. He fought in the Pacific in World War II. He fought and he beat cancer. When he was 101, he was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic melanoma. He was put on a trial drug and he beat the cancer. And he fought for ordinary people. He was a union rep at Farmers department store, what was later became known as Myers. He was a member of the SDA for 90 years. And until yesterday morning, at half past one, he was the oldest living member of the Australian Labor Party.</span>

Yesterday, I got a call from Bert's great RSL mate, Jim Wrigley, that Bert had gone. Jim also told me that he went over to Bert's house, and in the corner where Bert had fallen over were two dead cockroaches. They don't make them like Bert Collins any more. Rest in peace, old friend.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Today is an important day for this parliament as we reflect on the 14th anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations, and I commend the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and particularly my friends the member for Hasluck and the member for Barton for their speeches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to commend a decision made recently by the New South Wales Premier to move to permanently fly the Aboriginal flag on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This is something I have strongly supported, particularly after it was raised with me very passionately by an Indigenous student from Hunters Hill High School in my electorate. This decision recognises the significant role that our Indigenous peoples have played in our nation's past, present and future, and the role of those communities, particularly in the Sydney region. I also want to reflect on the fact that, of course, the Sydney Harbour Bridge itself was the site of that incredible march of 250,000 people in the year 2000 in support of the cause of reconciliation—a march I was happy to join at that time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reminded recently of how far we have come when I saw a post from the current principal of St Aloysius' College in Kirribilli, Mark Tannock. He told the story that the then headmaster, the late Father Tony Smith, decided to fly the Aboriginal flag for the 1988 bicentenary. It quickly occasioned a visit by the police to warn him that radicals had taken over the school flagpole. The school is proud that the flag continues to fly today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Lifeline Canberra's biggest fundraising event is its annual book fair. It is loved by Canberrans and attracts over 50,000 people each year. Volunteers work all year to make it happen, and I was able to see some of these hardworking volunteers in action when I visited their busy warehouse late last year. It was set to celebrate its 50th book fair this past weekend, but unfortunately was forced to cancel the event on the weekend over safety concerns relating to protesters at Epic on Friday, including the destruction of fencing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For more than 50 years, Lifeline Canberra has provided telephone support for people in crisis. Lifeline is the benchmark for suicide prevention and mental health advocacy. We lose one Canberran every week to suicide, and Lifeline Canberra is vital in keeping this awful statistic from being higher. This crisis support has never been more important than during this pandemic, with family and social support structures torn apart through lockdown and border closures. Nationally, Lifeline receives a new call every 30 seconds and received over one million calls last year alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The book fair had set a fundraising target of $1 million over the three days. Lifeline Canberra's annual running cost is $4 million, so the book fair is crucial. I urge Canberrans to continue to get behind Lifeline's important work, especially in light of the book fair being cancelled this year.</span>

The little boat was overflowing with 181 passengers, mainly women and children. Sixty-five passengers were Australian nurses. The SS <span style="font-style:italic;">Vyner Brooke</span> was clearly not a navy boat, yet, on Valentine's Day 1942, 80 years ago today, nine Japanese planes bombed the vessel 30 times in five minutes, killing many passengers and sinking the ship. Twelve Australian nurses never made it to shore. Of the 53 nurses who did make it to Indonesia's Bangka Island, 21 would live just another two days before they were marched into the sea and machine-gunned to death by Japanese troops on Radji Beach.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this because one nurse, South Australian Sister Vivian Bullwinkel, survived and told the story of the extraordinary bravery of her colleagues. Although scared, these nurses had not tried to hide from the Japanese because they had sick and wounded to care for. They thought that, being women and nurses wearing Red Cross armbands, they would be safe. Tragically, they were wrong.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, in my seat of Boothby, the Governor-General dedicated a brand new memorial to these unbelievably brave women, made possible by $500,000 of federal government funding—a project I have worked on and spoken about throughout my time in this place. This is one of the very few memorials to Australia's servicewomen, and I hope that we will soon see funding for a sculpture of Sister Vivian Bullwinkel at the Australian War Memorial. For today, we remember all the nurses for their courage, bravery and sacrifice. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise to honour the life of Michael Beahan AM. Many among us in this place are deeply saddened by the passing of Michael. Michael was a dear friend to me. He was kind and generous with his time and his offering of advice to me. Kindness and generosity are not usually associated with politicians, but he was no less effective for it. He left a formidable legacy of service to the Australian community and to the Labor Party. He served as the Western Australian ALP state secretary, and in that time he put in processes that led us to electoral victory. He also served as a Western Australian Labor senator from 1987 to 1996 and as President of the Senate from 1994 to 1996, during the Keating Labor government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After parliament he remained deeply committed to the Labor Party and to working for others and the community. Many Labor members in my local electorate, in the Brunswick Labor branch, spent time with him over the years, lucky enough to share his wisdom and passion for social justice. He was an advocate for the role of neighbourhood houses, for local communities, for health services and for other social justice projects. He was one of those genuinely lovely people that grace this planet from time to time and that the rest of us had the good fortune to know and befriend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a public servant in the truest sense of the words, he was a good man. It was never about his ego. He was always about helping others. It is a legacy that will endure for those of us who were fortunate to know him. I extend my condolences to his partner, Margaret; his children, Daniel and Kate; his stepchildren, Georgia and Michael; and their families. Vale Michael Beahan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Just over a year ago in Canberra, I went to see a demonstration project involving bidirectional energy charging technology funded by ARENA. For those who don't know what bidirectional energy charging is, it basically enables your car to become a mobile battery—if you have electric vehicles, that is. That can be a very resourceful use during power outages. It means you can charge your electric vehicle car from your rooftop solar panels, and then, after you've finished driving for the day, you can use your car battery to power up appliances at home. Bidirectional energy charging is literally putting power in the hands of people. But the best part of this is that it can use renewable energy, which then helps to drive down emissions. I can't believe how quickly this technology has developed and become commercially viable, all thanks to a federal government grant of $3.5 million. That means the future is here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JET Charge, in Melbourne, is leading the way in making bidirectional energy charging a commercial reality. I recently visited this impressive company and met their founder, Tim Washington, who happens to be a Higgins constituent. JET Charge is a real-life example of how our government's commitment to technology R&amp;D is the right approach to driving down emissions. You need smart, sensible investment, and that means investing in technology, and that's what this government is doing—driving down emissions by supporting clean technology, research development and commercialisation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  I had the pleasure of joining with locals and visitors alike to take part in the Tumbatrek, a bush walk experience through the magnificent landscape around Tumbarumba. This year's walk followed a route that highlighted some of its most iconic assets, including the development of the Snowview Estate, the Tumbarumba to Rosewood Rail Trail, local mountain bike tracks and the Hyne timber mill. It took in around 16 kilometres. This iconic annual event provides an informal opportunity for community and government leaders to discuss issues whilst experiencing the best of the landscape around us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this year's event, I was joined by local state members Dr Joe McGirr and Justin Clancy, along with Snowy Valleys' mayor and councillors. I enjoyed being able to have conversations with those from the Tumbarumba rotary, the Tumut Art Society, the Tumba cycle association, Snowy Hydro, the Hyne timber mill and other local businesses and community advocates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tumbatrek was the brain child of Tim Fischer, a former deputy prime minister who, in 1985, along with a few keen locals, wanted to promote tourism in the Tumbarumba region. It went into a short recess in 2007 before it was resurrected by the member for Riverina. As the member for Eden-Monaro, I have the honour of holding Mr Fischer's bushwalking stick, and the legacy that he leaves for this community and the ideals behind it are not lost on anyone. I look forward to, hopefully, the return of the dinner event next year, which was cancelled this year due to COVID. I say a big thankyou to Kayley and the Snowy Valley Council for arranging the event. Although a little sore, my husband and I are looking forward to next year's event.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  May I take this opportunity to congratulate Scotty James on his silver medal in the snowboard halfpipe at the Winter Olympics. Scotty grew up in Warrandyte in my electorate of Menzies. He first competed as a 16-year-old and, in the decades since, we've seen him consistently become one of the best performers in his area of skiing in the world, competing in World Cups and other outstanding events. In winning silver, Scotty improved on his bronze medal at Pyeongchang in 2018. So I congratulate him and wish him well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the event, many may recall seeing the interview with him in which he said, 'Now I need to finish off my collection for the pool room in Italy in 2026.' We hope that over the next four years he can add to that bronze medal and silver medal with a gold medal to complete that collection. Not only is he one of the best competitors in his chosen sport; he's worked hard to secure the best training facilities that can possibly be provided for—the halfpipe at Mount Buller in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also congratulate the other Australians who have performed very well at the Winter Olympics, including Jakara Anthony and Jackie Narracott. But, indeed, just to compete in the Olympics, to be an Olympian, is a great achievement in itself, and I congratulate all the members of the Australian Olympic team.</span>

But, if your office is a tractor in Tallangatta or a shearing shed in Ruffy, the story is very different. This government is failing regional Australians when it comes to phone and internet coverage, hobbling our ability to run businesses and keep up with global competition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Rob Jamieson from Ruffy for giving me this list of what a modern-day farmer needs good phone and internet coverage for. Banking is moving online. Tax requirements, including bank statements and payroll, are online. So are fulfilling regulatory requirements like biosecurity, national livestock identification certificates, buying and selling of stock, agricultural census requirements, remote monitoring of irrigation, water tanks, lightning trackers, equipment, research, maintenance, security monitoring, data analytics to track yields, the spraying of fertiliser, drones to monitor fencing and livestock and, of course, emergency communications in firestorms and floods. The list goes on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farming in Australia is a high-tech industry, but this government provides farmers with phone and internet coverage from the Dark Ages. I am committed to improving phone and internet technology for the people of Indi, and I won't stop pressuring this government to show up for farmers, residents and all small businesses that deserve the tools that they need to live and thrive in the 21st century.</span>

It was also the year that George Town Medical Centre GP Dr Tim Mooney AM began working at the practice. Born and raised in the town, Dr Mooney graduated from the University of Tasmania in 1979 before returning to his home town. With a commitment to both his practice and the community, Dr Mooney has been heavily involved with the Australian College of General Practitioners and the Royal Flying Doctor Service and was a founding member of the Rural Doctors Association of Tasmania. In 2017, his decades of dedication were aptly recognised when he was made a Member of the Order of Australia 'for significant service to medicine through a range of multiple practice roles, to doctors in rural and remote areas, and to the community'.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I have been contacted recently by many Qantas long-haul flight attendants who are deeply concerned by Qantas management's application to the Fair Work Commission to cancel or terminate their enterprise bargaining agreement. This will result in huge reductions in income and conditions for loyal Qantas staff. These workers feel let down by Qantas after they stood by the airline through the most difficult period of its existence. They had long periods where they were stood down and had to get other jobs. Many of them risked their health and safety on repatriation flights long before a vaccine was ever developed. They have been in isolation after simply going to work. Many of them had to go into two weeks isolation just after undertaking flights. They have gone above and beyond. Yet, after only a few months of negotiations between Qantas and the FAAA, Qantas are off to the Fair Work Commission to try and cancel the enterprise bargaining agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to both parties, and it's evident that they're not too far apart in reaching an agreement. Qantas received over $1 billion worth of taxpayer support during this pandemic to get them through, and I believe it's incumbent upon them to treat their staff fairly, come back to the negotiating table and seek to nut out an agreement with their loyal staff. They have, unfortunately, form with this. They recently sacked their ramp staff and baggage handlers, and it was found to be illegal by the Federal Court. Let's hope they don't go down that path once again. Qantas, don't use this pandemic as an opportunity to try and smash the union. Get back to the negotiating table.</span>

I adore my community, which I have been part of for more than two decades. The central Gold Coast is my home. It's the home of ideas and innovation, experiences and thrilling adventures, and it's the perfect holiday destination for Australians and our international students and tourists. The part I most enjoy is visiting schools, community organisations, sporting clubs, surf clubs—I've got nine of those—aged-care homes, galleries, temples and events. The Gold Coast's multicultural communities go far beyond coexistence. We have a special ability to share knowledge and ideas with one another to build a strong community where all who call Moncrieff home support one another and work together.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community has faced many hurdles throughout the last two years. Our primary industries of tourism, hospitality and small business have all suffered major setbacks due to state border restrictions, freight delays and now workforce shortages. Despite those challenges, the resilience and perseverance of the central Gold Coast, the home of the entrepreneurial spirit and self-made success stories, prove that we will continue to work together to overcome our challenges well into this next year of 2022.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  The Morrison-Joyce government hate accountability, and that's why they've broken their three-year-old promise to introduce a national anticorruption commission. We know from the cabinet leak last week that the Prime Minister only became interested in the integrity commission when he thought he could bundle it up to help pass the Religious Discrimination Bill. This government has no shame. They announced plans for this commission over 1,000 days ago, and it is sorely needed. A recent analysis of grants over three years by Nine media revealed that coalition-held seats received a massive $1.9 billion compared to $500 million for Labor electorates. In my Hunter region, all four Labor electorates combined received less than half what the Deputy Prime Minister's seat of New England received by itself—$48 million for New England compared to $800,000 for the electorate of Shortland, which I have the privilege to represent. What a disgrace!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public trust in politics is at an all-time low. In our age of social media, fake news and an environment where far-Right extremists are attempting to dominate the civic space, we elected officials have an important role in restoring this trust. The creation of an anticorruption commission would help with this task. Integrity in public life matters. Fighting corruption matters. Misusing public funds for political gains matters. This is why the Australian people are demanding an independent national anticorruption commission. An Albanese Labor government will deliver one; this corrupt Liberal government will not.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  On 21 January this year, I proved positive to COVID. I wasn't too worried about that because my health advice over the last 12 months has had me on vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, B1 and other supplements to improve my immune system, although I was in trepidation about going back home to Phillip Island to tell my wife that I had tested positive. I also had access to Ivermectin, which we both immediately went on as soon as I tested positive. We had five days of ivermectin and then another five days to prove it treated. I had some symptoms. I had a bit of a rough time for three or four days. I am not vaccinated. I won't be vaccinated because my view was the risk from being vaccinated was just as high as the risk I was taking from getting the virus itself. So I had to make a decision, and I made a decision on my behalf. I made a decision that I wanted to continue in this House, and I had just been through a fairly major health issue only a few weeks before, so I was fairly vulnerable. But I believed I had actually done the right thing and protected my body in the way that I wanted to protect it, by the choice that I made and the choice that all of those demonstrators out there we're talking about have made—choice and freedom and not having the things that they do imposed upon them by politicians in this place and others. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

Since the Black Summer bushfires, I have been working with a large number of local groups, organisations and councils with regard to what they need to help with bushfire recovery. Earlier in 2021, I took part in a lengthy process to ensure local projects were supported in the Shoalhaven and the Eurobodalla. Although I remain disappointed that this process has taken so long and that the government has clearly politicised the timing of these grants, I'm pleased to see that many local projects have been funded, bringing a total of over $22 million in local projects for the Shoalhaven and the Eurobodalla—projects that I have fought hard for. The Mogo Community Recreation Hub in the Eurobodalla is being funded to the tune of just under $1 million. The Moruya Showground, the home of the Moruya evacuation centre during the bushfires, will also receive an upgrade. Conjola Park, also hit hard by the bushfires, will receive funding for Conjola Park foreshore recovery. These are just some of the terrific projects which I look forward to supporting as they go ahead.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary Australian: Army nurse Vivian Bullwinkel. On this day 80 years ago, she was onboard the SS <span style="font-style:italic;">Vyner Brooke</span>, which was fleeing Singapore and overflowing with 181 passengers, including women and children and wounded soldiers. Sixty-five passengers were Australian nurses. The ship was bombed and, of the 53 nurses who did make it to Indonesia's Bangka Island, 21 would live just another two days before they were marched into the sea and machine-gunned to death by Japanese troops in a horrendous act of brutality. We know this because one nurse—Bullwinkel—was shot but feigned her own death and survived to tell the story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bullwinkel died in 2000, but she didn't let the experience define her life. She survived three years as a POW. She retired from the Army in 1947 and became the director of nursing at Melbourne's Fairfield hospital. She devoted herself to the nursing profession and to honouring those killed on Bangka Island, raising funds for a nurses memorial and serving on numerous committees, including for a period as a member of the council of the Australian War Memorial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one place where we tell the stories of service and sacrifice, and that is the Australian War Memorial. There are plans to establish a statue in Bullwinkel's honour. What a great act of bipartisanship it would be for this federal parliament in the middle of a pandemic if we could find a way to fully fund a statue to commemorate Vivian Bullwinkel and all the nurses who have served in the Australian Defence Force. I say to those nurses: thank you for your service on this, the 80th anniversary of the Bangka Island massacre. I have written to the Prime Minister seeking his support for a statue at the Australian War Memorial.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  On 9 April 2019, this government committed $3.4 million to headspace in Kempsey to provide much-needed mental health services to the youth of the Macleay valley. After 2½ years of delays I was very happy to finally be advised that the building works were finally underway to fit out a fit-for-purpose building at the headspace Kempsey location, which will soon be open. Despite the lengthy delays, the expansion of this youth service has provided youth mental health services to 58 young people, and it has 73 active clients at present. It is also pleasing to hear that partnerships are at the advanced stages of being formalised to ensure the four core streams, including mental health, work and study, physical and sexual health, and alcohol and drugs, are in place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vitally important that the whole range of services are available to the youth of the Macleay valley—a place where they can go and, if they need help, talk about the social, physical and emotional changes that affect so many young people in today's society. I look forward to attending the opening of headspace Kempsey on 14 March 2022 and working with the Samaritans for the benefit of our youth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 30 January 2022, of the Honourable Michael Eamon Beahan AM, a Senator for the State of Western Australia from 1987 to 1996, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael Beahan's surname is Irish. It is derived from the Gaelic word 'beatha', which means life. When Michael was 17, his family started a new life. Like so many others at the time, they left postwar Europe and embarked on a months-long journey travelling from London to Perth, Australia. For young Michael, his new life in his new country took the shape of an electrical apprenticeship. He would work as an electrician for the next 10 years. Then, sadly, tragedy struck. Michael was involved in an horrific traffic accident near Goomalling. His girlfriend, Leith, tragically, died.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a line in an Irish poem, <span style="font-style:italic;">On Raglan Road</span> by Patrick Kavanagh, that goes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that was true for Michael. That terrible event affected him deeply. It set him on a new course to become a teacher. Active in the teachers union, Michael joined the Australian Labor Party in 1968 and it was the beginning of a long contribution. Almost two decades later, in 1987, Michael was elected to the Senate by the people of Western Australia. In his first speech, there was a theme that followed him throughout his time there; it was about how we should treat each other in political discourse. In that speech, he admonished activists in the peace movement who believed they had a monopoly on principle and morality. He said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You do not have to bleed to show that you have a heart: you do not have to pray to demonstrate the presence of a soul.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael Beahan understood that two people with different views can respectfully disagree, and that having a different view doesn't make you more moral than the other person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As President of the Senate, one of his proudest achievements was introducing the art acquisition program. He didn't like that the parliament's art collection was static, set in stone, and dominated by the artists of Sydney and Melbourne. So in 1988 he set out for a collection that better reflected the country. He was proud of the fact that, when he left here, there was Indigenous art from urban artists and more art from Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael Beahan admitted late in his parliamentary career—in fact, on the very last sitting day of his time in parliament—that he had been elected to a Senate as a cynic. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was no enthusiastic supporter of the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand that on some days! It was a view that had been informed watching from afar the events of 1975, but it was a view that changed. In part it was because of the committee system, which he loved:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You are forced together, working towards common goals, usually finding consensus, travelling together …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael was very conscious that our debates draw out our best tone and civility in the hours that we keep and our role in contributing to the type of cynicism that he himself once had. It all matters, he said. And we're still grappling with those questions a quarter of a century on—though I should add that Michael passionately argued for an end to wigs and gowns, and that change was achieved by his successor. So progress is indeed possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael left the parliament because he lost a pre-selection. He was defeated by 71 votes 69. It doesn't get much closer than that. But he didn't mope. In fact, the day after he ended his term as a senator, he married Margaret—a new stage of his life was beginning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Beahan's life was a life well lived—from London to Perth, Bunbury, Melbourne and Canberra. From devastation to 'the dawning of the day' he was a gentleman who wanted us to always be at our best. On behalf of the government, I offer my heartfelt sympathy to Michael's wife, Margaret, his children and extended family. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If ever there was a face that looked like it had been designed to emit an aura of geniality and goodwill it was Michael Beahan's. Through his life he would wear many hats: electrician, peace activist, teacher, union member, encourager, changemaker, Labor true believer. He was also the survivor of tragedy: a car crash that he survived but his girlfriend, Leith Jackson, did not. Even with the passage of the decades, it is just too awful to contemplate. Somehow, the young Michael emerged from that with a sharpened focus on what mattered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Western Australian state Labor Secretary, he was a modernising force in the 1980s and he played a crucial role in the party's successes at a state and federal level during that remarkable decade. When he entered federal parliament as Senator for WA during the Hawke-Keating era, he made it clear in his first speech to the Senate that he was concerned with getting things done. Having overcome some of his own reservations about the Senate, which in his mind sometimes suffered from memories of its role in the 1975 constitutional crisis, he gave speeches on industrial relations and working conditions, education, the economy and electoral matters. He spoke with persuasive power on the Native Title Bill. He developed a full and detailed view of parliament, seeing how it all pieced together, what worked, what didn't and what best equipped parliamentarians to serve the interests of the Australian people. True to this approach, he looked past some of the more flashily obvious aspects of parliament and saw the value of parliamentary committees. What he saw in them was a greater breadth of representation and perspective and an overall impact that he felt was rivalled only by the emergence of political parties and the advent of proportional representation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he became Senate President, he took on the challenge of lifting the standard of question time, clearly taking to heart the view of another president, John F Kennedy, that we choose things not because they are easy but because they are hard. Michael understood that the televising of question time had a big impact on the standing of the institution. As he put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I used to think it was only my mother who watched me at question time, but there are a lot of other people who watch question time. I was recently door knocking in Shark Bay when somebody said, 'Hello, Mr President. Come on in and have a drink. I watch you every day.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael also understood the potent symbolism of this very building itself and sought ways to make Parliament House a living, dynamic building that better reflected our great nation. One way to approach this was through the art collection. As he later reflected:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There was almost no Western Australian art, very little Queensland art, no urban Aboriginal art and very little Northern Territory art. We set about redressing that imbalance first of all, then maintaining the collection as a living collection and not one that was rooted in 1988. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you walk through this building, possibly on your way to Aussies, you'll pass Michael's official portrait in which he's been carefully painted smiling gently from among a collection of framed canvasses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he left here, Michael kept his focus on what mattered, favouring the result over the display. By the time he was appointed a member of the Order of Australia in 2011 it was for service to the parliament of Australia, to the promotion of international bipartisan political debate, to the pharmacy profession and to the community—a ten-pound Pom who turned out to be a true bargain for Australia!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our hearts go out to his wife, Margaret; his children, Daniel and Kate; his step-children, Georgia and Michael; and his eight grandchildren. May Michael rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">14:10</span>):  Just before I call the Prime Minister, I have a short statement to make. On Thursday after question time, the Leader of the Opposition asked me to reflect on comments made by the Minister for Defence in responding to a question during question time and report back to the House. When the matter was raised during question time, I made it clear that I had not heard the comments, as the level of interjections was so loud as to prevent me from hearing precisely what had been said. I have, however, since carefully examined the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> transcripts of that period of question time and considered the relevant sections of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> at pages 516 to 517. Even though no explicit charge was made by the Leader of the House, there was an insinuation made by the Leader of the House. I'm of the view that, in context, the reference by the Leader of the House about the Leader of the Opposition is not in order under standing order 90, and I would ask that such comments not be repeated.</span>

It's been reported by journalist Peter van Onselen that last week the minister strongly argued against legislating a stronger anticorruption commission. Was the fact that the minister paid $30 million for a piece of land worth $3 million mentioned in the discussion, or did everyone in the room just join the dots?</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, the first part of that question may be in order, because there was public speculation—again, rumour and gossip and bits and pieces that appeared in the media—and the opposition may base some question on that. The second part was a slur, and it was made to be ruled out of order. It was a political stunt, Mr Speaker, and it should be treated as such.</span>

                  </a>  Thanks, Mr Speaker. It's quite specific in <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> that ministers are meant to be across major issues within the media. This certainly qualifies as that. In terms of the issue of an anticorruption commission, the minister is representing the Attorney-General in this House and therefore he is the appropriate person to ask. The reference to the land purchase is something that has already been dealt with as an in-order question many times in this House.</span>

The second part of the question, in my view, is contrary to standing order 90 in that it does, in my view, constitute an imputation of improper motive. I'm happy for the minister to deal with the first part of the question.</span>

As she would well know, there is a well-established convention, for very good reasons of public policy, that cabinet ministers do not comment on or disclose what occurred in cabinet. I recognise it has been quite a long time, for very good reasons, since anybody on the other side of this House was in cabinet, because the Australian people have not seen fit to trust them with the heavy responsibility of government. It is quite curious to be on the receiving end of lectures about probity and public policy from the member for Ballarat, of whom it was said in ANAO report No. 9 of 2014-15, 'the recording of reasons for funding decisions did not adequately explain'—</span>

                  </a>  It is true that we do face, particularly at this present time, incredibly uncertain international and regional circumstances. These are very uncertain times. It is a very uncertain environment, not just in Europe but in our own region here in the Indo-Pacific, with the threats and the coercion that we face here in Australia. We are seeing threats and coercion and bullying in other parts, which I will come to in a moment. It is a time for resolve, it is a time to stand up against those who would seek to bully, whether it is Australia, whether it is Lithuania, whether indeed it is Ukraine. It is a time to stand up to the bullies and the autocrats who work together, not just in Europe but also here in our own region. It is not a time for having an each-way bet on national security. It is not a time for appeasement and the trading away of Australian values in search of appeasement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a time to work with our partners, as our government has done, enlivening the Quad that was dismantled by the actions of the Labor Party when they were last in government. It is a time for AUKUS, which was brought together with our closest of partners in the United Kingdom and the United States, for a generational leap forward in our national security settings that were put in place by our government to give us the capability to defend Australia in a way we have never been able to before and to work closely with our Five Eyes partners. It is a time to strengthen our defences, as we have done as a government, whether it is our cybersecurity defences, our land defences, our air defences, our sea defences, and particularly our submarine capabilities. All of these are working together to keep Australians safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, as Russian troops are amassing on Ukraine's border—and Australians in the Ukraine have been advised of the seriousness and dangerous nature of this situation now for many weeks—we look at these issues and these events with great concern. We support Ukraine's sovereignty, absolutely; we support their right to their territorial borders, that they not be imperilled by their neighbour. We denounce Russia's bullying, their coercion, their intimidation and their threats of violence against Ukraine. We will always take steps to do that. We have taken those steps with our like-minded partners. But I know that the Chinese government has not stood with the rest of the world in denouncing the actions of Russia, and they should do so. There should be no cue taken from the actions of Russia for coercion or bullying in our region. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It took the coalition, the Nationals and Liberals, approximately two days to meet their funding requests so that we could get this dam rebuilt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This dam is so vitally important for both the people of the city of Bundaberg, in the member for Hinkler's seat, and for the people in the seat of Flynn. I acknowledge the great work that the member for Flynn and Col Boyce have done in making sure that this becomes a reality. I also note the macadamia industry, for which this was so incredibly important, and the Steinhardt family. It was great to look around with Bree Grima to see what we can do with this water now that we're securing it once again—98 per cent of our macadamias get exported, as well as the sugar cane, which is a vital component of the heritage of that area and also part of the future of that area. This is absolutely showing the people of Central Queensland how serious the coalition is and how serious the Nationals and the Liberals are about making sure that we are part of their prosperity into the future.</span>

The member for Griffith is apparently the shadow minister for water; we never hear any questions from her. The member for Blaxland apparently covers regional services; we never get any questions from him. The member for Brand covers mining resources. The best one of all is the member for Franklin, with agriculture—so important in our nation, yet we never get a question. It's like the Casper cabinet—the Casper cabinet of friendly ghosts who never actually ask a question! It's like a one-man show. We will never know about alternative policies, I say to the member for Flynn, because we never actually hear from the alternative ministers. This just goes to show the shallowness of any alternative government they propose.</span>

Of course, the premise of his question is entirely misconceived. Quite differently to the proposition he put to the House, in fact, our government has a well-developed, carefully-thought-through model for the Commonwealth Integrity Commission. We have gone through a very detailed process. Hundreds of pages of legislation are in the public domain. We have gone through a nationwide consultation process, with 333 written submissions. And we have put in place the necessary funding. In fact, in total, almost—</span>

                  </a>  The simple fact is: while the shadow Attorney-General may not like it, what I'm going to show squarely are the very extensive policy efforts made by this government in developing a detailed model for a Commonwealth integrity commission. I know the shadow Attorney-General is not great on detail when he doesn't have an instructing solicitor; I know that. We have a detailed model. We have committed, as I was saying before he leapt to his feet on an unsuccessful point, $150 million in funding. And it's very clear that the Commonwealth Integrity Commission will be able to investigate past conduct and matters that occurred prior to its commencement. Its jurisdiction—this is an important point—will include over 145 criminal offences that currently exist in legislation, including offences under the Criminal Code Act, fraud, abuse of office, falsification of documents, offences under the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act and the Public Interest Disclosure Act. Under our detailed and well-developed policy framework, the government will also create new offences relating to corrupt conduct, including concealing corruption and repeated public sector corruption. So we have a well-developed model, and I simply repeat the offer that the Prime Minister has made publicly and repeatedly: we stand ready to introduce this legislation as soon as the Labor Party indicates that it will support it.</span>

Treasurer, Albury-Wodonga desperately needs a new hospital on the border. Last year the member for Farrer said the government is 100 per cent behind a new hospital, but Senator Hume has said the government does not have a funding role. The Deputy Prime Minister has said the same. But that's not true. The government gave Shellharbour Hospital $128 million and Geelong hospital $50 million before the last election. So which is it, Treasurer? Does the government fund regional hospitals or not, and will you commit $300 million for a new cross-border hospital in Albury-Wodonga as soon as possible?</span>

She has raised this issue specifically with me and she is aware that the Commonwealth is helping to support hospitals to a record amount. Under this government hospital funding in Australia is at a record high. We consider a range of infrastructure projects, but, as the honourable member knows, there is a real role there for state governments. State governments have a real role to play in funding those infrastructure projects. So we'll consider proposals on their merits, but we recognise that the Commonwealth does help fund hospitals. But, when it comes to infrastructure projects, state governments have a key role to play.</span>

She is a very strong advocate on behalf of the tourism sector. She's a strong advocate on behalf of small business. Indeed, more than 30,000 in her electorate are going to be able to access the immediate expensing provisions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At every turn we have sought to cut taxes—cutting taxes for small business to the lowest level in 50 years; providing record amounts of investment incentives through our tax system, which have been particularly effective through this pandemic; and cutting taxes for families. More than 11 million Australians have received more than $30 billion in tax cuts, and beneficiaries have been young people, particularly young women. Women aged 25 and under are paying 20 per cent less tax today than under the Labor Party—worth more than $2,000 a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, every step of the way, as we've sought to cut taxes, we've been opposed by a Greens-Labor coalition. That's because, when it comes to tax policies, the policies are very similar. The only difference is the colour of the letterhead. I went to the Greens website and I had a look at their tax policies, and they look like a Labor wish list. There's a housing tax—we've heard that before. There's a tax on family businesses and trusts—we've heard that before. There's a tax on the mining sector, a carbon tax, higher taxes on superannuation and higher taxes on income earners. Then, of course, most damningly of all, on the Greens website there is a 30-year project for the Leader of the Labor Party: death duties and inheritance tax.</span>

Indeed, more than 50,000 members in his electorate are getting tax relief as a result of policies that we on this side of the House have supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easy to forget what the state of the economy was early on in this pandemic in 2020. We saw 1.3 million Australians lose their jobs or see their working hours go to zero. Treasury thought the employment rate could potentially reach as high as 15 per cent. We responded with programs like JobKeeper, which helped save more than 700,000 jobs. Today we have an unemployment rate at a 13-year low of 4.2 per cent, on track, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia, for a 50-year low, with a three in front of it. There are 1.7 million more Australians in work today than when Labor was in office, including one million more women in work today than when Labor was last in office. So we will continue to invest in infrastructure and skills programs and to cut taxes to deliver this strong economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach is in stark contrast to that of those opposite, because this Leader of the Opposition has never held a Treasury portfolio. This Leader of the Opposition, this leader of the Labor Party, has never delivered a budget. Indeed, his economic policies consist of a $6 billion cash-splash to pay people who have already had the jab. He wants to support the economic recovery with a national drivers licence as well, and he wants to remove the fuel excise—wait for it!—on electric vehicles. That is the state of the Leader of the Opposition economic roots. There is no excise on electric vehicles. The Leader of the Opposition talks a big game from opposition, but, in government, Labor delivered something very, very different.</span>

Labor talk today about secure work, but the reality is that, when they were in government, unemployment was 5.7 per cent. It's 4.2 per cent today. The Labor Party talk about high wages. When Labor were last in government, real wages were falling. The Labor Party talk about the cost of living, but electricity prices doubled when Labor were last in government. They talk about lower debt, but they've made more than $90 billion of additional spending promises that aren't funded. They talk about lower taxes, and we know this Leader of the Opposition supported $387 billion of higher taxes at the last election. We on this side of the House stand for more jobs. We on this side of the House stand for lower taxes. The same can't be said about those opposite.</span>

That helped save Australia from this pandemic over the course of these last few years. The government did move to put in place JobKeeper, to support apprentices, to put the cash flow boost in place, which means we've come through this pandemic with one of the strongest economies in the advanced world. And, yes, we took the decision in August 2020 to ensure that we manufactured the AstraZeneca vaccine here in Australia, where we could manufacture it, because other vaccines were not able to be manufactured in this country or so many other countries around the world. We did all of that, and we now have the highest vaccination rates in the world.</span>

                  </a>  You don't do anger very well, Richard; you know that. The reality is that this government is investing some $270 billion in Australia's defence capability. Now, you ask yourself the question: why would Labor have ripped money out of defence and out of ASIO and out of the Australian Federal Police and out of the ACIC when they were in government? It's because they lost control of our borders. They had lost control of our borders; that's the reality. And it's not just this Leader of the Opposition you need to be concerned about.</span>

                  </a>  I was asked about alternative approaches. The fact is that when Labor were in opposition last time, before the run-up to the 2007 election, they promised Australia that they would keep the economy managed, as John Howard did, and that they would keep investment in defence going at the levels that the Howard government had. When they got into government they did the complete opposite. So don't look at what they do or say in opposition; look at what they do in government.</span>

The whole frontbench is like some sort of relic of the past from the Rudd-Gillard years. When you look at the number of boats that arrived on their watch, it gives you a bit of a flashback to the incompetence that they presided over when they were last in government. Don't forget that, if you look at the member for McMahon, one of our favourites, when it comes to tax policy— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:57</span>):  I thank the member for her question. Tackling the threat of cybercrime has been an absolute priority for the Morrison government. As the director-general of ASIO said just last week in his annual threat assessment, during the pandemic we have all spent more time online, and that means that there have been a number of security challenges that have been presented to us and that we have to deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last financial year alone, the Australian Cyber Security Centre received more than 67,500 cybercrime reports, and over a quarter of those incidents were on critical infrastructure systems. These critical infrastructure systems are the systems that deliver essential services that all Australians rely on, and they include things such as water and sewerage, energy, our banking and financial services, transport, and food and groceries. Any threat to these very vital services is a threat to our way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why last November the Morrison government introduced into parliament and passed the first tranche of its critical infrastructure reforms—so that our nation is much better equipped to deal with a range of threats, including cyberattacks. That was the first stage of a two-part legislative approach, and last week I introduced the second tranche of our critical infrastructure legislation into parliament. That includes changes that will deal with risk management systems and how requirements for systems of national significance are actually put in place and administered. In addition, we have been progressing work on our Ransomware Action Plan. We released that last October. We've been going through a process of consultation with businesses and with the community. Under that plan, there will be a range of new criminal offences and tougher penalties, and we will hit the cybercrooks where it hurts them most, and that is in their bank balances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is absolutely no doubt that our nation is facing a very clear threat when it comes to cybercrime, and businesses, individuals and governments all need to be resolute in tackling it. The suite of measures that we have introduced as a government is delivering a very sound and very clear message to anyone considering interfering with our critical infrastructure and our way of life. The message is: you will not be successful and you will face very tough penalties. As a government, we will always act in the best interests of Australians and make sure that jobs and essential services are well protected. We will always continue to do that. We understand that national security is a very serious task and not one that should be risked to a party that lacks the resolve or the gravitas to tackle serious issues in a responsible and resolute way. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is the normal course of events, it is the normal convention, that when cases of that subject matter are heard it is the normal course for the Commonwealth government to provide what we did on that occasion.</span>

After further discussions with the Western Australian Premier, I took the decision for us to withdraw from the case. It was our view that the normal convention that applied outside of a pandemic, and the situation of the pandemic, led us to make that decision and we withdrew that decision. And I'm pleased with the result that was finally arrived at by the court.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I thank the member for Groom for his question, and I commend his genuine concern about the safety of women and his advocacy for protecting women and children at law. The Morrison government has, of course, had a bill in front of this House for approaching 1,200 days—before the Leader of the Opposition, before the Labor Party and before the Australian Greens—to strengthen the character test and enable the government to deport more foreign criminals from Australia who commit serious crimes against women and against children, and family and domestic violence. So, while the Leader of the Opposition has time to go back and look up his school homework, I would ask him to do his homework on this bill. If he did his homework on this bill he would know that these reforms will allow us to deal more swiftly and more quickly when serious crime occurs, thereby preventing more family violence and domestic violence against women and children in Australia. It begs the question: why would the Labor Party oppose for 1,200 days a bill that says the government should be allowed to deport foreign convicted criminals for serious offences? This would have to be one of the things you've opposed the longest and the most in the Labor Party's history, you feel so passionately about it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the opposition and the Australian community: the Morrison government will not back down from our view that the law needs further reform to deport more foreign criminals and stop them in their tracks when they commit these serious crimes against women and children in Australia. It's an important issue.</span>

                  </a>  To hear the heckling from the Leader of the Opposition, I have to say: who does he take his instructions from on this issue? We know he is in lockstep with his partners, the Greens. The Greens are the ones who really oppose this bill, and they have dragged the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition to this position. Why would the Labor Party continue to oppose this? It's all because of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition isn't taking an each-way bet on this; he's taking the multi on this. He's on every single position in relation to the deportation of foreign criminals. I say that's not good enough and this government says it's not good enough. If we have to put this bill for another 1,000 days, we will. We believe passionately that the law is important and the construction of the law—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  Just before members leave, I want to address the House on something. I note that the member for Warringah isn't in the chamber. Hopefully, she's listening from her office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Thursday the member for Warringah raised an issue with me relating to the length of last Wednesday's sitting, which ran through Wednesday night and into the early hours of Thursday morning. The matter was also raised with me by the member for Chifley. As members know, the meeting and adjournment times of the House of Representatives are set out in the standing orders and are a matter for the House to determine. On those occasions when the House sits longer hours to deal with specific legislation, a decision of the House is required. I understand this often occurs following discussions between the government and the opposition, and I am not involved in any way in those discussions. While sitting until 5 am is certainly not desirable, and I'm sure we all hope it is a rare occurrence, those who work in this building know it is always a possibility that longer hours of sitting may occur from time to time. However, I understand the member's concern about the House sitting through the night and finally adjourning just after 5 am, and I note recommendations of the Jenkins review aimed at balancing wellbeing with the business of the parliament—particularly recommendation 27, which addresses the parliamentary sitting calendar and the order of business. I expect that matters such as this one raised by the member for Warringah will form part of the consideration of those recommendations.</span>

It's customary to thank friends and colleagues, but we can do that over a 'Lukiatto' or a late-night dinner. It's customary to hold our family tight and say thank you for the remarkable opportunity, but we can do that at home. This opportunity I want to devote to thousands of Australians who never lost faith in what we do here, and at a time when so often—perennially—in Australia we are tempted to dismiss, discard or disparage democracy. There are so many people out there, colleagues, that cannot count their time here in days or months or years or even decades. They were never here, but they fought and provided the basis of this pyramid that we enjoy of democracy, whose apex is right at that dispatch box. They weren't just our campaigners—they were anyone who cared enough to fill out a petition; bang the table; dare I say, glue their hands; burn the doors. Whatever their passion about federal issues, I need to say: in your own way, thank you, because it may be ugly but it's our ugly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got a friend, Geoff Redpath, known as Twinks. He lived in Anzac Avenue, Camp Hill, and with his piercing blue eyes he would look at me as I would try to explain to him my shortcomings in this place, and he would ask me about what happens down here. He desperately wanted to know about the ifs, the buts, the workarounds, the expedience, the flexible and malleable morality that's on show here sometimes, and I would just try and try and explain. Geoff will be remembered as an unsuccessful LNP preselection candidate, and if you go on the web you'll see on the ECQ website that he ran in an unbelievably close division 6 election for local government on the Fraser Coast, where three candidates all got 33 per cent. He led by 50 votes after prepoll and fell short by about that margin, and within months—no wife should come home to find a lifeless husband in the backyard shed. But he never lost hope; he wanted to fight to the end for this great nation in his own way. If I could talk to Twinks now—and there are so many of his mates that will grasp for answers and perhaps never get them—I just want to say: by never giving up he gave us an opportunity to do what we do here.</span>

In that time I've been proud to see two outer metro prime ministers do amazing things for this nation. Those busy outer metro people that so many of you will know who are busy commuting and driving—we often observe they drive into the left-wing water bubblers and pot plants only to drive home to the real thing at night: real water and real bushland. There's not a lot of headroom there for global issues for them. They're busy and they care about population, roads, jobs and development, and it's over and over again. Those conversations of outer metro Australia are now a serious force.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us together—like you can't choose your family, you can't choose Team Queensland—are a ragtag band who do great stuff down here, and in your own way you cut a cloth that works for your electorate. I was inspired by Don Randall, the great WA MP, who didn't give much for the pomp and the procedure down here. One day, when he was driving around his electorate doing what he did so well, he pulled over to one side when he didn't feel well and he died in his car serving his electorate. He was, I argue—perhaps Ross Cameron's an exception—one of those first outer metro MPs who was here for there. This place is made by those people, and long may it stay that way. All of you, wherever you are, whether you're sitting in tea rooms recruiting membership or filling out the petitions that got us a defence force recommendation for a next-of-kin medal—Kay and Kerry Danes—and whatever you did, that's what makes it special and that's why I'm so delighted to have been here. Outer metro Australia is not deeply ideological. So, when you drive out from whatever city skyline you might inhabit and you head out to those parts, those expectations are simple, but if they see you doing the right thing they'll adopt you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say a little word about social policy and a little bit about the place of activism on the Right. Social policy is very important to me. I find economic policy sometimes a little formulaic. My apologies to the member for Fenner, who has exceptional expertise in that area. In social policy, the decision in 2001 was: do we join a party of economic credentials and fight silently on social policy? In two decades that has changed. Forgive the partisan comment, but I would argue that it is now this side of politics that is potentially the most progressive in reforming and rebuilding and reimagining social policy. We don't just fight for inputs; we fight for outcomes. And I think that's so important. When we arrived, the member for New England was speaking up in the party room in a way that absolutely captivated me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took a different path and started working on pharmaceutical policy, something I knew a bit about, with Chris Bilkey and Professor Philip Clarke from the University of Melbourne. We mapped out a way to save the nation about three-quarters of a billion dollars every year. I didn't believe those figures at the start. The minister didn't believe those figures at the start, but, to his credit, he took on that idea before we lost power, and to Labor's credit they continued it. To this day, that one single backbencher policy saves this nation three-quarters of a billion dollars a year and another $60 billion to $70 billion of out-of-pockets for non-concessional cardholders who paid way too much for drugs for their kids. That's what we're here for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We fought hard for education so that teachers in the poorest areas of Australia could have the gains they achieved in NAPLAN and ATAR recognised. We still don't have those metrics. In welfare, it's been about work for the dole. It's been about making sure we get value for money and about the principle of mutual obligation—that you're not paid a welfare payment as some sort of automatic right but there's an expectation that if you can give you should give. So much credit goes to the former member of Warringah in those areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In housing, a very, very understated, quiet former adviser, Carolyn Rosario, said to me in 2018, 'What's your government got for people my age?' I reached for her speaking notes, and she said: 'What you need is to help us with deposits. In a Canberra rental market you can never ever save for a deposit with the rents we pay.' We sat down and did a one-page summary. We sat down with the Banking Association and ironed out the glitches, took it to the Assistant Treasurer and to Treasury, and, without me knowing—and we can argue over the provenance—our leader announced it. The campaign launched in 2019. Since then, 56,000 families that would be renting today are in their own home and they don't have to ask a landlord if they want to put a nail in the wall to hang up their young child's merit prize from school. We know how transforming that is. The Reserve Bank governor, just last week, was saying that it's about income. It's about raising household income, and everything else is so able to follow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Indigenous policy, these have been long and trying debates, colleagues. You'd be right to say not much has changed. I spent a year in a semi-desert community, Lajamanu, and we pioneered a breakthrough drug that's now a standard treatment for trachoma. What I learned there is that we must never, ever forget the needs of remote Australia where the Indigenous languages are still spoken at home and never let that be washed away by general Indigenous statistics that don't reflect the true suffering in remote Australia. We, colleagues, are marked on what we're doing in the farthest corners of Australia—a globally unique political challenge and an immeasurably hard one. If, in the next few months, we can terminate and complete successfully a 20-year journey to allow a young Indigenous couple wanting to take out a loan from a bank to build a home on native title land—I cannot believe we haven't achieved that in the last 20 years. But I have to walk away from this place saying, 'Not yet.' It's remarkable that we haven't found a way to bring lenders to the table to make that possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In welfare reform, it was about keeping Work for the Dole tacked together under significant attacks, but we saw the PaTH program expand that. One day I saw that the department, before Easter and Christmas, would routinely pay welfare cheats and people who were not compliant bonuses that the minister's office didn't even know about. I worked to make sure that stopped. To our credit, that has also happened. This touches on the role of activism. It's probably a little bit too strong to say that that has been an important part of my time here, but I firmly believe there's a role for activism on the Right. How you define it is a different question, but I want to say that we have brought through, in this party room now, many strong social policy reformers and many people prepared to be activist. You might say that it may impede our path to government or keeping in government. But, if there are some little things that in your heart you feel you've got to fight for, I'm just saying: 'Fight for it!' Let people know how passionate you are about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best example was from 2019. Our training providers and RTOs all over the country—Bernard and Daman Malik are here with me today—came to me and said, 'We're being driven into the ground, potentially, by an overly heavy and unreasonable bureaucracy.' I'm not speaking on Mr Malik's behalf but, in many cases, there was the perception that, simply, the chief officer wanted fewer RTOs in this country because other countries had fewer. We are the nation of small business. Those RTOs in every corner of regional Australia are providing the training and the vocational skills outside of TAFE. Eighty-five per cent of that training is private, and, to be driven off to court to the AAT and be told to muscle up with a barrister and find a hundred grand to keep your family business open when there was a chance to work together with RTOs was devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an MP, you can give a speech in the tiny Federation Chamber, snip it on YouTube and send it out to the people that matter. Two months and a week later, that chief executive was gone. Since then—thank you to the member for Swan—things are way better in the training space. Don't for a minute think that that's not important, because our greatest export is people, and one of our greatest service exports is training and educating overseas students. I will provocatively say that, more than submarines and tanks, our best foreign policy tool is to educate South-East Asia in the highest-quality English-speaking vocational modules and university courses. That does us an enormous diplomatic advantage. We need to make sure we are a major slice of international education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we move through activism, there was also some crazy, stupid stuff—like the cruise ships. You remember getting booted out of here for 24 hours by Speaker Bishop for the bunker oil that was spilt in the chamber here. Who benefited from that, politically? Was I going to get a couple of votes from Balmain mums or a few people who live around ocean cruise ship terminals? But, honestly, for those companies to burn clean fuel in ports in every corner of the world except Australia—because we didn't mandate it—and to keep burning the disgusting stuff here, I thought, was disgusting. So speak up on it! I finally dragged the table to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is a way of being activist about small things, I think that makes a huge difference. We saw, in Logan, streets torn apart and fence palings ripped off and everyone mugging each other. It wasn't, in these interracial fights, the case that we needed more social workers. I made the obvious observation that they needed jobs and opportunity. If you connect the disadvantaged and the dispossessed with work, that's the difference. I was absolutely ratioed for it, but months later, after the dust had settled, all the inquiries said just that. If we can start to think about the importance of connection to the economy as the solution, I think that's really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For our South African colleagues, when I saw the farmers being murdered and mutilated, I asked a fair question: is it completely mutually exclusive to be white and a refugee? It isn't, and it was important to ask that question of DFAT. I give them credit: they looked at that hard. We've also had designated area migration agreements that have provided a partial solution to this most complex of social issues. But these elements are utterly ones that we can all choose in our own time to fight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time for the sealed section. There are only people sitting around me because I promised to read out a few of the myths that deserve to be busted today, and in most cases the answers are going to be yes. It is true that I broke into a biohazard area during a white powder scare in my time in a ministerial office, purely because I wanted to check my emails. That is true. I then had 12 hours in there being fed McDonald's Big Mac meals by a dude in a biohazard suit. The only upside was getting a biohazard suit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was doing my best for the Howard government. I remember Mr Howard asked me, 'What do I need to know about meningococcal?' I said, 'Prime Minister, there are only three things you need to know.' Before you ever say that to a prime minister, make sure you know what the third thing is! I was writing a speech for the Prime Minister and for my boss in the Senate, and I had the strange failing of writing that this vaccine would be funded for those 18 and under, instead of those under 18. A colleague of mine was listening and he tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Which one was it?' We realised we had just spent, without any authority, about $20 million on meningococcal vaccine delivery to 18-year-olds. Thank you to my team for finding some kind of workaround.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I also need to fess up here about my leadership aspirations and my leadership challenge in 2007. It was messy. I was tired of what was happening between Howard and Costello, and I decided I would announce my leadership bid the following day at the party room. I thought I would run those lines by a few staffers at the Holy Grail, and only later was I told that one of those in the group was John Howard's son. As I walked away to the sound of my own footsteps, I'm sure the first words were, 'Who is that guy?' It was neither good nor pretty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But inside this building there are some special memories as well. The first one is that we may hold the record for making a division in this chamber from the furthest distance. I was in Civic on the corner of Constitution Avenue and London Circuit, luckily in a car. We got green lights, and if you can do it at all you can do it with ease. But I was hurting inside. That's a record for you to break. I am looking to Angus Taylor for that. I've perennially raced him up and down that bloody Red Hill, and, when I asked him, 'Mate, what's your best time?' and he told me, I went out and broke it by 10 seconds. He then revised his time and said, 'I told you the wrong one.' He told me he was actually five seconds faster than what I'd just run. I said, 'Mate, I want to see the metadata.' It's never been forthcoming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Comcars have been an important part of our lives, and I must confess: yes, it is true that, I having lost my phone down a stormwater drain when getting out of a Comcar, the driver dismantled the stormwater drain and lowered me in head first, holding on to my belt, while I foraged around to find the device. We did, and I nominated him for Comcar driver of the year. He came second. It was rigged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We move forward to the media. I have an apology to the Melbourne <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> for not one but two occasions. First of all, when they phoned up and said they had identified what they believed to be a first-term MP wearing board shorts after midnight with a mattress on his head in Howitt Street, Kingston, we said, 'Deny, deny, deny,' but I was completing a move between apartments. We simply said they had no DNA evidence, and they elected not to go to print. Likewise, in Bougainville, when I for some reason jumped into the back of a truck full of Bougainvillean rebels and put my arm around them and did a Black Power salute with my white hand, again it was, 'Deny, deny, deny; it was simply the arm of a lightly complexioned Bougainvillean,' and they were told to ignore the fact that the latest model of iPhone was in that hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true we have done some pretty silly handstand sculls, the first of which, again, was at the Holy Grail, pre-smartphone. I said, 'I'm sure I can get away with it,' and knocked down a beer. The only way you should do it Down Under, Hawkie, is upside down. Every journo, of course, had no camera with them. They proceeded to report the story and simply used my parliamentary photograph in the newspaper upside down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, we do mow lawns in Bowman to get votes. I do want to confess: the 'Lam mow' was launched in the back of a utility. We had a mower. Many argued there was no motor in it, but it's true: I did mow one lawn in every suburb on one day. It is true I didn't completely have consent to mow the lawn from the homeowner. I had what I believed was a single mum who sounded like she desperately needed a mow. I didn't realise the partner was at home with his size 12 boots, and midway through the mowing he came out, opened a stubby, popped out a chair and watched me mow his lawn. It wasn't good, and, from now on, I've promised that, if ever someone says, 'Please come and mow my lawn,' I'll make sure that I have consent from every adult in the household. So that's the end of my confessions. There was one final one about writing op-eds, and one would have wondered whether they were actually going to lead to us getting into government from opposition or not. But that one contributed by my friend the member for Dickson: everything you said last night was dead right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, I want to mention some special people. We all have incredible offices behind us, don't we? I want to mention my team: Sonia Bryant, Stephanie Eaton and Penny Donald, and, more recently, Mitchell Dickens and Peter Nugent. But I'd also like to mention the young ones who came through our offices, where we provided platforms for them to go off to great things, like Matt McEachan, Mitchell Redford, Marty Kennedy and Shane Goodwin. There are those in Queensland who are passionate people, as I described earlier, from the president, Lawrence Springborg, to Lincoln Folo, Guelf Scassola, Con Galtos and Craig Luxton. Those people all exist in every one of our lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this chamber, of course, I have referenced Team Queensland. I've loved talking welfare with the member for Pearce, who is someone that I think will be greatly missed in this place. On the other side, there's the member for Fenner. I always remind you, sir, that it took you four times as long to get your Harvard degree as it took me to get mine. After 12 months, they said that there was nothing else they could teach me. Then, of course, there's the deputy chair, Lisa Chesters, who has done an awesome job standing by the work of the committee, and there's my neighbour Maria Vamvakinou. Further afield, there's Gareth Ward MLA, a man of impeccable character in the New South Wales parliament, and Steven Marshall MLA, the Premier of South Australia, who took me to sailing lessons where we rammed straight into the marina's rocks with a journalist onboard. Thank you for that, Steven.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be honest, I've thought hard about just how inconsolable I would be at the time I talk about family. But I've been nothing but elated, and I want to celebrate and be thankful for the incredible time I've had with my family through this job. Either I need more empathy training or my time at home has been truly incredible. To all the dads out there, there's nothing better than coming home 18 times a year and getting that massive groundhog day hug, like you've genuinely been missed. There's nothing better than to have your daughters say, 'Dad, you're back already.' 'Yes, darling, it's a short sitting week.' And then, after a couple of days, they say, 'Dad, when are you going again?' They have an incredible place to grow up at home, thanks to my lovely wife. I want to say to Olesja: our community has given us incredible support, and we have got through that, and your story, which is an amazing one, is now inextricably woven into the story of Australia. I dumped you into the WorkChoices election in 2007. You had no idea what was going on, but you roadsided with me, something we've pioneered from Bowman that has now afflicted every campaign in Queensland. I can remember my wife coming to me and saying, 'Darling, they all seem to know your "L" name.' And I remember a tradie driving in his ute. His window came down, and he clearly wanted to say something. It could have been good or bad. He looked me right in the eye, and he went like that, thumbs down, and then he pointed at Olesja, and he went like that, thumbs up, and he drove off—I thought, 'Whatever it takes.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Olesja, your story is remarkable. Your grandmother was a Belarusian partisan who basically lived in a burrow while the Nazis overran the country. Her husband went out briefly to try and find some supplies. When he came back, his wife and children were gone. They'd been found by the Nazis. It's a hard story. That mum looked after her two babies as well as she could, but they perished in her arms one by one from starvation on a forced march. She could have been liberated to the West when the Americans arrived. They gave her the choice of any Allied country in the world to live in. She said, 'No, I'm going back into Stalin's Russia to find my husband.' And she did. They spent winters eating bark, but they were together. She had more kids. That's why you're with me, darling. They're your elders, and those elders and that history is now part of this incredible social experiment we call Australia. I think that is truly, truly remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I quoted Robert Kennedy. I remember that PM Howard leant across to Christopher Pyne and said, 'Clearly one of yours, Christopher.' In that fabulous South African speech in 1966, he said that every time a person stands up for a principle and acts to look after the lot of another, or take on an injustice or stand up to it, there's a tiny ripple of hope. Every time they do that, there is a tiny ripple of hope that is sufficient to sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance. They were words designed for South Africa, but I thought it was still an utterly reasonable test for what we do here. They may not be mighty walls in Bowman, but they can seem pretty impervious down here. Those tiny cracks of opportunity that come along every now and then are the ones you grab to make this country a little bit fairer and a little bit more understanding of the people who most need it. Never underestimate those people. It doesn't matter if they vote for you or not; you make an incredible difference in their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I talk about ugly, but it's our ugly. I talk about never dismissing, disparaging or abandoning what we do here. Today I want to talk to all of those people who do that and give us the opportunity to be here. If I could be judged on those grounds, so I will: #jobdone, no fuss.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  I rise to support the second reading, though not the amendment, of the Courts and Tribunals Legislation Amendment (2021 Measures No. 1) Bill 2021. This is obviously a bill that has a number of technical changes and adjustments to the way in which we deal with administrative law and justice in this country. I suppose I would like to start by taking the opportunity to make a few general comments about the value of having the system that we have, particularly the Administrative Appeals Tribunal system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very common expression in law, going way back, that it's important that punishment fits the crime. I equally think it is important that access to justice is fairly weighted against the significance of its cost and the need for people to seek avenues to reflect and perhaps even appeal decisions that we as a government make. It is vital to our democracy, particularly in administrative law. Particularly when it comes to the executive of our government, it is quite important, in my view, that citizens have fair and reasonable opportunity to appeal and seek review of those decisions. We all know, as members of parliament, that a lot of decisions made can be at a level that is not worthwhile, and it would be very difficult to pursue them through the superior court system if that were the only opportunity you had. If someone applied for a visa and it was unsuccessful or if someone had an issue with a determination that had been made about their eligibility for a government entitlement, it obviously would not be reasonable, and it would be unjust, if their only recourse were to go through a potentially expensive process of going to the Federal Court, say, or beyond. If we didn't have other avenues, a lot of people who felt they had the right to have decisions reviewed and, in their view, changed, wouldn't have access without a burden of cost that would make it impossible for a lot of them to pursue it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As members of parliament, we have constituents come to us with these sorts of issues all the time. Whilst we're clearly, as parliamentarians, not in a position to give opinions or adjudicate over decisions that constituents may believe are unjust or should be changed—and nor should we—equally, it's important that we support them in pursuing an avenue where they can seek to have decisions reviewed, and to see that occur in a way that's accessible to them. Most of the things that we're changing through this bill are relevant to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is exactly that body. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal gives people access to a level of review that is appropriate to the standard of issue they have, which shouldn't cost them an inordinate amount of money to seek to rectify.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If memory serves me well, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal first came into effect in the 1970s. It was for the purpose of ensuring that people had an avenue that meant they didn't have to go to the superior courts for matters that would be expensive to pursue there—and that, of course, would also potentially overwhelm the superior courts, like the Federal Court—and even on appeal from there. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal achieves that quite effectively. It means that people can go at a lower cost. It means they can get a quicker decision outcome. And it means that decisions that are made by our administration, by the executive, by people with delegated authority and by agencies et cetera can be appropriately reviewed by people who have the capability and the expertise to understand whether or not the correct law has been applied in each circumstance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not surprising that on a regular basis we need to review and modernise the way in which the AAT and elements of administrative legal appeal are structured, because things change on a regular basis as far as the types of matters and issues that may be raised at the AAT and others are concerned. Equally, we can ensure that we have efficiency. Much like case law improves the understanding of statutes and the principles and fundamentals of different areas of our law, exactly the same principle applies with the AAT and the way in which they adjudicate over cases and determine whether or not a matter that has been brought to them is in fact a decision that should be overturned or a decision that should be kept in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the changes that is being made here is to make that a little more efficient, allowing for AAT and others to make decisions with a different burden of reasoning on the decision made, and so to determine that if there is no general principle that needs to be given a view on then some decisions can be a little more efficient and quicker so that people get their decisions as quickly as possible. We want that. I think that's very important. I know, when I've dealt with matters that are on appeal to the AAT and other bodies, it has been the case that at times those decisions can take a little while. And when it is perhaps someone appealing a decision that has been made regarding a visa or an entitlement through social security and other services—veterans' entitlements et cetera—not just is it the decision that's important; it's important that the decision is made in a timely way, because speed of justice and speed of decision-making is vitally important for people in those circumstances as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note with interest that there are also a couple of adjustments being made in the bill regarding the way in which certain immunities exist for foreign governments when it comes to, in some cases, quite ancient treaties that we have in place with regard to their status and their potential immunities in our legal system. I have to confess that I do not have a deep enough understanding of some of the complexity of that. I think there were some matters mentioned in the notes that I read regarding a case between a foreign government and a corporation here in Australia. But, clearly, it makes sense for us to embrace and implement sensible suggestions, which are made by those who do understand the legal ramifications of certain decisions made in law, for improving things through the change in statute that we are making here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, it is pleasing to see opportunities to make the AAT and other avenues of access to justice for all Australians cleaner, clearer and modernised. We always want to see and ensure that in this country everyone has equal access to justice and review of decision-making. We don't want to be in a situation where anyone who might have fair and reasonable grounds to seek review of or appeal a decision of government, or a decision of the administration, finds that they can't pursue it or that it's not in their interests to pursue it because the cost or time of doing so is prohibitive to them. We want to ensure that there are appropriate avenues for this. The AAT has achieved this for many, many decades. What we see in this bill now is an opportunity to enhance the way in which the AAT and, similarly, other federal avenues of appeal on decisions are administered. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  This bill, the Courts and Tribunals Legislation Amendment (2021 Measures No. 1) Bill 2021, would make a number of largely administrative amendments to various acts of parliament relating to federal courts and tribunals, principally the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The legislation amended includes the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act, the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the Family Law Act, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Act, the Federal Court of Australia Act, the Judiciary Act, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act, the Paid Parental Leave Act and the Social Security (Administration) Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst other things, this bill would empower the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, to direct that a proceeding in the Social Services and Child Support Division be referred to an alternative dispute resolution prehearing process. It would allow the President of the AAT or an authorised member or officer of the AAT to summons a person to give evidence or produce documents across all of the divisions of the AAT, including the Taxation and Commercial Division and the Social Services and Child Support Division. It would clarify that the AAT's power to correct errors in the text of a decision or in a written statement of reasons for a decision can only be exercised by the president or the member who presided at the proceeding. It would clarify that hearings conducted remotely using videoconferencing technology in a federal court, including the Family Court, are in open court. It would update the terminology regarding the jurisdiction of a single justice of the High Court sitting in chambers or of another court exercising federal jurisdiction sitting in chambers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend the Admiralty Act to bring the admiralty rules into alignment with other rules of federal courts, such as by, among other things, declaring the admiralty rules to be rules of court. It will amend the Foreign Judgments Act, the Foreign States Immunities Act and the International Arbitration Act to provide certain procedural protections to foreign states, and it will remove the ability to hear appeals from the Supreme Court of Nauru in the High Court of Australia. All of these amendments are supported by Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three aspects of the bill, however, have attracted controversy. The first is the proposed amendment to the Federal Court of Australia Act that would allow the Federal Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, to provide short-form reasons, rather than detailed judgements, when a decision dismissing an appeal did not raise any questions of general principle. This has been criticised by, among others, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, the Josephite Justice Office and the Law Institute of Victoria on the basis that it will disadvantage unrepresented applicants, including those seeking review of refugee decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also a proposed amendment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to remove the role of the Governor-General in the process for appointments to the AAT. The bill would have conferred that authority on the minister. However, there have been notable institutions that have expressed concern about this change—again, the Law Institute of Victoria and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, among others—principally on the basis that there is no obvious justification or reason for it and the change could undermine the independence of the appointment process. There is no obvious justification or reason for this change. In fact, the Attorney-General's Department did not advance any justification or reason to the Senate committee inquiry into this bill. Its submission was completely silent on these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill would provide to Immigration Assessment Authority reviewers the same protection and immunity as a justice of the High Court of Australia has. Those protections are currently conferred on members of the AAT while they perform their duties. Again, the Law Institute of Victoria, the ASRC and others have argued that such protection should not be extended to IAA reviewers because, unlike AAT members, IAA reviewers do not have to take an oath of office, do not have special skills or knowledge, do not have fixed terms in advance and are not statutorily required to disclose conflicts of interest. Unlike AAT members, IAA reviewers are also not required to afford procedural fairness to applicants. Fortunately, the Senate—with some concurrence of the government—has agreed to amendments to resolve these issues. We thank the government for agreeing to all of these amendments in the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of you will know, before entering this place I was a lawyer. Indeed, I was President of the Law Society of Western Australia, a director of the Law Council of Australia and inaugural chair of Law Access in WA. Access to justice is very important to me, and the AAT plays a critical role in providing access to justice. It may be surprising for people to know that up until the creation of the AAT there was no formal and established way across the Commonwealth to access merits based review of administrative decisions. Indeed, litigants were limited to accessing the prerogative writs through the High Court, and later through the Federal Court system, for judicial review of such decisions. It was the creation of the AAT and its sister tribunals that provided a broad basis for merits review of administrative decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These decisions cover a wide array of decisions made by government and government officers, and they impact on the daily lives of Australians in many different ways. I'm sure many, if not all, members of this House have engaged with those agencies that frequently see their decisions appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or its sister tribunals or to tribunals that have since been merged into the AAT. These, of course, include immigration matters, social security and Centrelink matters, Department of Veterans' Affairs matters and taxation issues. All of these are really important to everyday Australians in their dealings with government. It is important in that regard not just that there is a process to access merits review but also that that process is accessible to ordinary Australians and that it does not come with a lot of the difficulties and costs associated with accessing a court process. This is particularly the case with a merits review process such as the AAT should provide, because it provides the individual with an opportunity to present new and additional information to a decision-maker in the AAT about a decision that government has taken and have that decision made again. It is not limited just to causes for appeal to a court through a judicial review process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If our courts and tribunals are not accessible then, of course, they are not an effective way for Australians to assert and be guaranteed their legal rights. In this case, the case of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in particular, it is the citizen's rights against the government. Unfortunately, the way this government is administering the AAT is resulting in politicisation and, in turn, massive delays, and justice delayed is justice denied. Last year, in the same week that its own budget papers confirmed that wages would be going backwards for another four years, the Morrison government reappointed four of its mates to these taxpayer funded jobs. Since 2013 the Liberals have, staggeringly, appointed at least 79 of their mates to the AAT. In contrast, in the six years of the Labor government, from 2007 to 2013, there were just two Labor linked appointments to the AAT—both experienced and highly skilled lawyers welcomed by the then Liberal opposition. The appointment of Liberal mates to the tribunal is so out of hand that even former High Court Justice Ian Callinan QC had to recommend to government that all further appointments be on the basis of merit. One would have thought that all appointments to the AAT were based on merit. But it turns out that this may not be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year, tens of thousands of Australians rely on this tribunal to conduct an independent review of decisions by Commonwealth ministers and public servants. These decisions can have life-altering impacts such as whether an older Australian receives the age pension, whether a veteran receives a service pension, whether a participant in the NDIS receives funding for essential support or whether a refugee obtains a visa. The time frames for people seeking justice or review through the AAT are now something that we all should be ashamed of. Let me provide an example. One of my constituents lodged an appeal through the AAT. It took over a year for the AAT to acknowledge receipt of that appeal—not to hear it, not to deal with it, not to provide a decision, but just to acknowledge receipt of it. After one year it still wasn't scheduled for any procedural process through the tribunal, let alone an actual hearing. This is an example of something we are seeing repeated across the registries of the AAT around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are clearly issues in the administration of the AAT occurring under this government, but a big part of it is that a large number of members of the AAT are not fully competent to perform their role in the timely manner in which they need to do so. That is holding up justice; that is preventing citizens from receiving justice. It is preventing them from being able to hold their own government to account to provide the supports they need and deserve, and which we as a parliament have legislated for them to have access to.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Membership of a political party is not in any way a disqualification for appointment to a tribunal, and I readily acknowledge that many of these members are undoubtedly competent and highly qualified. The tribunal, though, is now rightly perceived by many in the community as hopelessly and absurdly politicised. Worse, these jobs for mates, of which there have been 79 since 2013—that's nearly 10 a year—have resulted in the work that the AAT needs to do not being done and not being doing in a timely manner. It is denying justice. Just like the current Liberal government, sadly, the AAT is failing to deliver outcomes that deliver justice for Australians. Australians deserve a better future for the AAT and a better future for our justice system. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  There have been some egregious amendments before this parliament, but this one probably tops the list. Once again, we have the Labor Party playing games, this time with our justice system. Why do they do it? So they can post on one of the most discredited websites on Australia, the one which is run by OpenAustralia Foundation. They put up articles claiming that people 'strongly voted' for or against particular issues in this parliament. Newsflash to all the lefties out there, most of whom can only think what they are told to think: you can't 'strongly vote' for stuff in this chamber; you can only vote for it or against it. Those opposite have the gall to come in here and lecture us about justice. They wouldn't know justice if it slapped them in the face with a three-day-old salmon fish. That's how appalling this amendment is. They cannot help but simply play games. It never stops—and they seek to be the alternative government of this country! Their bedfellows on the crossbench never stop lecturing us about honesty and integrity—oh, and climate; how could I forget climate! I wonder what OpenAustralia Foundation will make of some of their donations today.</span>

                    </a>  The member for Shortland can get upset, but I bet that in the seat of Shortland the Labor Party preferences these fake independents. David Hardaker at Crikey said that I was 'frothing at the mouth' when I made a speech on this two months ago. If I was frothing at the mouth back then, I'm as angry as hell today. The people of Australia deserve to know the truth—and they deserve to know the truth from those opposite, who cannot help themselves. They come into this chamber today and seek to play games with our justice system. Their mates on the crossbench take money not just from coal investors but from a director of a coal company, and not just any coal company but a coal company purchased from Eddie Obeid, and not just an ordinary investor but an investor who had an adverse finding against them by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, and not just any donation but the largest donation that they received, and not from a number of transactions but from a single transaction that was then split eight ways. And why was that done? So it could be under the threshold, so they didn't have to declare it. And how did all this come to light? Did those opposite front up? Did those opposite tell people how this happened? Did they admit to their administrative mistake? No, no, no. We had to wait for the Australian Electoral Commission to do an audit.</span>

                    </a>  The member for Shortland can shout as much as he likes, but the fact is that we know he and his party will be preferencing those who claim they're in favour of the climate while taking donations from coalminers, who say they're in favour of honesty while trying to hide these donations, and who say they're in favour of integrity but couldn't tell us what happened until there was an audit by the AEC. And that's who the Labor Party prefers to be in parliament. And then they put the votes up on the OpenAustralia Foundation website. The OpenAustralia Foundation should not have tax deductibility, because it isn't a charity, but it does. And I suspect they probably misled the ATO when they received that status as well.</span>

That's all I want. I just want those people who claim that democracy only thrives when we have a well-informed electorate to do some of that informing today, rather than hiding the truth from their readers. It's time to fess up and admit that the people you have been promoting shamelessly for three years have actually been taking donations from coalminers and coal investors who bought their coalmine from Eddie Obeid—so let's leave integrity out of this for the minute!</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the actual administration of justice, this bill makes that justice and that administration better. But those opposite come in and make all sorts of claims and allegations, under parliamentary privilege, without being able to back up any of them. This is a good bill. It should have the support of all sides of the House. And the Labor Party should stop this nonsense and the silly games and moving second reading amendments just so their undergraduate politics can play out on the internet.</span>

The introduction of the Courts and Tribunals Legislation Amendment (2021 Measures No. 1) Bill 2021 is another step the government is taking to ensure that our legal system keeps pace with community expectations. Importantly, this bill will improve the administration of the Australian federal courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, known as the AAT. It makes a number of amendments to enhance the operation of the AAT and harmonise procedures across most of its divisions. The amendments impact the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and a number of pieces of legislation in the families and social services portfolio.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the Judiciary Act 1903 to modernise practices, which will produce efficiencies in the hearing of matters. It makes minor amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act, the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Act 2021 to clarify that hearings conducted remotely using videoconferencing technology are exercised in open court. This clarification is particularly important due to the broader use of remote hearings since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes amendments to the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 to clarify the application of this act to ex parte proceedings, to ensure that foreign states are afforded appropriate procedural immunities. Furthermore, the bill similarly extends these procedural protections to proceedings relating to the recognition of enforcement of a foreign award against a foreign state, pursuant to the International Arbitration Act 1974.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also clarifies that the Admiralty Rules 1988 are rules of court, and it applies certain provisions in the Legislation Act 2003 to the operation of those rules. This will exempt the rules from sunsetting but require that they be registered and published. This aligns the treatment of the Admiralty Rules with the rules of the Federal Court.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill repeals the Nauru (High Court Appeals) Act 1976, which was enacted to give effect to the agreement between the Australian government and the government of the Republic of Nauru for appeals to the High Court of Australia from certain classes of decisions of the Supreme Court of Nauru. This agreement was terminated on 13 March 2018 and, as such, the act is longer required.</span>

Ultimately, this will benefit those Australians seeking to resolve disputes in our legal system. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  It is a pleasure to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2021 because this parliament should take a great interest in anything to deal with the way in which we think through the things that are affecting us as a country, an economy and a community, particularly through the arms of research in this nation. Labor have already said we will support this bill because we do appreciate that the bill itself is designed to amend the Australian Research Council Act to apply indexation to approved research programs, and it will also insert a funding year for the 2024-25 financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Research Council is an independent body which funds primary and applied research through the Discovery Program and the Linkage Program. It has been impressed upon us, through the bill itself and the documents supporting the bill, that this will be important to support the ongoing operations of the Australian Research Council, which we obviously support, and it's why we support the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To come to the broader point of research, research is critical. Particularly in the environment that we are in, where there is an active reconsideration of industry policy being undertaken by countries all over the world, there is a need for us to think through how we make the things that nations need, the way in which we are reliant on others and the way in which trade may or may not be working to help us in meeting the needs of the country. There is also a need for us to address things like self-sufficiency wherever we possibly can. That will not be something that can be achieved perfectly, nor should it be pursued overwhelmingly. We need to work out the things that we are strong at and good at and be able to mobilise resources to scale up those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic showed that when we needed certain things—most notably in the arena of medical equipment—we found at key points in time that we couldn't get our hands on masks and ventilators and, down the track, vaccines. It has also emerged that we need more access to masks, yet again, and to rapid antigen tests. This also showed us, when supply chains were under pressure, that we needed to reconsider how we manufactured the goods and provided the services Australians needed to get access to in times of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that has forced a reconsideration of industry policy is geopolitical factors. As I referenced a few moments ago, we have had to rethink where we get our goods from, the way in which trade is operating and the way in which disruptions to that trade may affect our ability to get those things. We are now seeing industry policy become a feature of public policy in a way that it hasn't for many years. In fact the view had been, through a process of economic liberalisation through the eighties and nineties, that industry policy itself had been too driven by governments, had not been sensitive to markets and had potentially distorted the way in which resources were allocated, and that we weren't getting the best outcomes. For many years in this nation—and it started under a Labor government—we moved away from the notion of what was described as 'picking winners'. That singular phrase has stayed in political discourse in this country and in economic thinking for decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet what was happening offshore was that nations weren't necessarily so dogmatic; in fact a number of countries were actively thinking about what sectors they could back—some of which had come out of command and control economies, most notably countries that had exited the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. I think of Estonia, which has completely reinvigorated its economy with a big focus on digital and tech. It is one of the outliers, one of the outstanding nations, in digitisation and what it has been able to do to reform its own operations. Countries have thought about their strengths. Countries have thought about what they can do to mobilise resources to get things done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From our perspective, Labor have said, through the National Reconstruction Fund, there would be a number of sectors we would think deeply about to ensure we see better industry outcomes. The pressure is on nations to think about industry policy in a new way, to think about how they can support sectors that are really important to their economy and, on the way, ensure that the economic complexity of nations evolves as well. As has been observed, when we look at Australia's economic complexity we see we have a lot of work to do to ensure that we are not completely and utterly reliant on a few sectors alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the National Reconstruction Fund that Labor have championed, we will look at improving value-adding in agriculture. We will look at improving value-adding in resources and mining. We will look at what we can do in the arena of energy and renewable technology development. We will also look at the arena of medicine and medical manufacturing, and at what we can do to support early-stage innovation and enabling technologies. Again, I come back to the point about picking winners. A lot of countries have dedicated themselves to having very rigorous programs in place to pursue the development of national plans around artificial intelligence, robotics and quantum computing. All these things will be really important longer term. If, as a country, we want to be left behind, we only need to underinvest in some of those areas. Other nations get it. This is an issue not just of economic security but of national security as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, there exists in the Australian community a hunger to see us deal with something that, I think, shocks a lot of people—that is, that we're ranked amongst the lowest in the OECD on manufacturing self-sufficiency. We import way too many things across critical areas where we used to have a history of local production. That has now gone. We need to rebuild it. We need to find ways to ensure that we've got the things we need. Bob Hawke thought this through many years ago. That was why he championed, back in 1989, the establishment of the cooperative research centres. It's why he thought about ensuring that we didn't have a brain drain. It's why he thought about how he and his government could broaden the way in which the economy was working to ensure that we weren't reliant on just a few spaces. We had the CRCs supporting economic and social activity along the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critical, if we want to boost manufacturing, which is what a lot of people want to see, is that if we're going to be a country that makes things we've got to be a country that thinks about how those things are made. Ideas are crucial, and we see those ideas emerge largely through the investment in R&amp;D that we make as a nation. As I mentioned earlier, the reality is that as a nation we don't do enough to address the issue of manufacturing self-sufficiency. If you want to make things, the other area you need to think about, as I said, is how they're made. On the R&amp;D side we keep sliding down the international rankings. We have seen investment in R&amp;D contract. It has fallen from 2.11 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 to 1.79 per cent of GDP in 2019-20. This is not good if we think longer term about economic health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at expenditure on R&amp;D incentives in the period from 1985 to 2017-18, for example, you see that there was a build-up of national activity under a Labor government and then a drop-off under a coalition government, only to be resuscitated under Labor and then fall again. Those stats don't lie. They are there. If we are not backing our brains, we will see ourselves short-changed in the longer term. As has been identified by countless reports on R&amp;D in this country, including reports commissioned by the government itself, we will only ever be followers. We will be importers. We will be basically leveraging off someone else's brains and someone else's ideas, and we will be a nation reliant on the imports of very sophisticated technology or product. We've got to be able to do better. We have to have the faith to back our local brains. We cannot continue to have a situation where we see cuts in that investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to research through arms like the Australian Research Council or others, the only consistency we do see is regular cuts from the coalition. From the moment they got into power, we saw continual attempted cuts. We saw a cut of $550 million introduced in the 2014-15 budget. Then there was an attempt in the 2018-19 budget to make a further $2 billion cut. This spooked even people within the coalition, and there was reporting by the Senate which talked about the damage this would do to the longer-term economic prospects of the nation. It had to be overturned. But what is staggering is that the coalition, without any sense of shame, then turned around and suggested that they were adding $2 billion to research and development in this country. They've been going around trumpeting how much they're investing in R&amp;D when the reality is that it was the prevention of a cut that they thought they would make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see so often in this country under the coalition is that there is no sense of a broader framework with respect to what research is being undertaken in the nation, what's required to support it and how government can put those things in place to ensure that it happens. So we see piecemeal efforts. We see the announcement of a patent box or a fintech sandbox here and there, or we see different initiatives rolled out during a Press Club speech and a bit of money put here and there, or we see this type of initiative put forward. It's playing around with research, which is how people reacted to the acting minister for education, just before December, deciding he would make a call on what research he valued and what research he didn't value. We don't see any significant plan by the coalition to say: 'Look, we are falling behind relative to other nations. This is bad for our longer term economic prospects, and here's what we'll do to fix it.' There is none of that. This bill does not provide that. Nothing else that the coalition has done will provide that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two consistent things, I have to say, about the coalition. One is that they will always attempt to cut, particularly in these areas. They will always make a budget cut on issues that are critical to the nation. The other is that when they're under pressure they'll make an announcement to make it look like they're doing the opposite or that they're better than they are. But the announcements themselves don't stack up. There's no substance to them. We find out soon enough that the detail overwhelms the spin and the shine and the gloss of the announcement and we are back to square one. We cannot afford that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of us on this side of the House recognise, we believe, that the people of this country—be they First Nations people or the people who came thereafter—given the isolation of this continent and the way supply lines have worked historically, have had to be smart enough to work out problems confronting them. In a dry and arid continent like this, we've had to make our own luck and we've had to have the smarts to do it. We need an investment in brains, through the Research Council or the tertiary sector or our vocational sector, making sure we've got that. The coalition have always cut and failed to support local ideas and failed to back thinking. I constantly hear from firms who are under pressure in the absence of government support and excitement for what they do that they think they'll have to go overseas. It is unbelievable that we still have that in this day and age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a constant thread through Australian history, where people have had to leave these shores to get backing for their ideas because we didn't back know-how, and that's not right. It's not right and it signals spectacularly a lack of faith in our own people to sort out the problems, economic or social, that face us all. We should not have that. We should be making sure that institutions like the Australian Research Council and others benefit from a solid framework backed up by a significant investment that ensures Australia is not just a place that makes things but also a place that knows how to make them well.</span>

                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  It's a pleasure to follow the member for Chifley on this debate on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2021, and I commend him for his contribution to the debate. Whilst the legislation provides indexation of research funding, the reality is that coalition governments—previous coalition governments and in particular this one—have no credibility and no commitment to research and development in this country, as the member for Chifley so eloquently highlighted. Even more shamefully, the Morrison government has a track record of politicising the government's research grants process—first in 2018, when Minister Birmingham blocked 11 research grants, and then in 2020, when Minister Tehan interfered. Now we've had Minister Robert, after just two weeks as the acting minister, veto six grants that were about to commence and that had been scrutinised and approved by the Australian Research Council, an independent body that approves the grants on the basis of their merits and their suitability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes Minister Roberts's interference even more disgraceful is that he announced his decision on Christmas Eve, when he clearly hoped that his actions would go unnoticed and unreported. He was hoping it would be all swept under the carpet and nobody would notice his mean-spirited action. It was an insensitive and callous decision that undoubtedly would have shattered the Christmas of those researchers who lost out from their grants being cut. So much for the minister's Christmas goodwill and Christmas spirit! Furthermore, the minister 's interference was disrespectful to the independent assessing committee and destroyed all public confidence in the grants process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it any surprise, then, that the Australian Research Council chief executive, Professor Sue Thomas, has announced that she will step down from her role early? I also understand that there has been a petition, with nearly 1,500 signatories, calling on Minister Robert to reinstate the grants. Even more notable is a letter to the minister and Professor Thomas, signed by over 60 current and past ARC laureate fellows, which is very critical of the minister's intervention. I will quote in part from that letter:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As current and past ARC Laureate Fellows, we are very concerned in the way that applications for 2022 ARC Discovery Projects were managed. Our concerns are threefold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, the funding decisions were announced a month later than usual, only a week before funding could commence on January 1st. Most if not all university research offices were by then closed till the new year. It is highly unlikely that any of these grants can indeed commence on January 1st, and staff be hired.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No good reason has been given as to this delayed notification. The retention and recruitment of research staff is greatly harmed by such delays. This late decision is likely to have the greatest impact on early career researchers, especially with regards to diversity and inclusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, the funding decisions were announced on Christmas Eve, giving an appearance that the date was chosen to avoid close scrutiny. This was a heartless date to give the many unsuccessful applicants news about their applications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, and most critically, six grants—all in the humanities—were subject to rigorous and independent peer review and were recommended for funding but vetoed by the Minister … These projects cover topics like climate activism and China which are vital for the future well being of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that that letter sums up the situation very well and highlights, in my view, the improper interference by the minister and the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Researchers in Australia continuously face uncertainty and insecurity, living from one grant to another—grants which, in most cases, also have to be subsidised by the universities themselves. These are some of Australia's smartest minds, whose research leads to life-changing industrial and medical science and technology that not only returns over $3 in economic benefits for every dollar invested but ensures Australia remains internationally competitive and capable of innovation. Indeed, we should be proud of the innovation brought about by scientists and other researchers in this country over the past decades. We have led the way on so many occasions</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we now have reports that over three-quarters of all young researchers have considered a career change in the past five years. I personally know of researchers who have left Australia to secure work overseas. And they got that work overseas, yet they couldn't get it here in Australia. Right now they are working in other countries doing the very research that would have benefited us, as opposed to the countries they are working in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding to the insecurity for researchers, Australian investment in research and development is at an all-time low, having fallen from 2.25 per cent of GDP in 2008 to around 1.79 per cent in 2018. The OECD average for research and development investment is 2.38 per cent. We are not only falling behind other countries but also slowly reducing the amount of money that goes into research and development in this country. How can we possibly remain competitive with the rest of the world if we are not prepared to invest in the research that is necessary to drive us forward?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This all comes at a time when universities are struggling to retain academics and researchers because of the loss of income that they face from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Morrison government's failure to financially support the university sector. Because universities themselves have to put money on the table with respect to many of these research projects, it makes it even more difficult for them when the government cuts its own funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view this is short-sightedness on the part of this government and, quite frankly, it beggars belief from a government whose ministers I've heard come into this place time and time again and talk about the importance of research in this country, which I agree with. Yet their talk is not matched by the dollars that they put into the sector when the budget comes around each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Chifley quite rightly pointed out, over recent years there have been hundreds of millions of dollars cut from research and development in this country, and when the government tried to put a few dollars back in a year or so ago it was simply a matter of trying to pick up some of the cuts they had already made. Sadly, they haven't continued with topping up the research and investment dollars that they announced a couple of years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's letter of expectation sent in 2021 to the Australian Research Council proposes several changes in respect of governance and the programs themselves. Both the Australian Academy of the Humanities and the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia have raised concerns about those changes. They have written to the government outlining their concerns. Their concerns are legitimate, and I urge the government not to ignore them, for they are the organisations that know best where the research dollars should be used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just conclude with an observation. The member for Chifley quite rightly alluded to this in his remarks and, again, it's part and parcel of the governance and programs that the government is saying it wants to support with research grants. It is: direct a lot more of the funds into the manufacturing sector. The automotive manufacturing sector in this country, when this government decimated it, was contributing about the same amount of dollars to this country that this whole package commits to. With the indexation, which is what the legislation is all about, this package commits to around $800 million in research and development funding. That is about the same amount of money that was being poured into this country by the car makers at the time they closed their operations here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are, on the one hand, talking about the importance of a sector and of investing in a sector, while, on the other hand, we had the sector already operating here and investing the same amount of dollars that we are proposing through this parliament today and that will be coming out of taxpayer funds. Those investments, albeit they were being made by the car makers, had benefits for the rest of society, and the research and innovation was then transferred and used by other sectors. Today we don't even make cars in this country anymore. That's the kind of loss and foolishness I see from this government and why this government has never truly been committed to research and development. It talks the talk but it doesn't walk the walk. Having said that, I hope that the government will at least listen to the concerns raised by the sector with respect to these allocations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  This bill, the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2021, amends the ARC Act to enable continued financial assistance to be provided for approved research programs administered by the ARC through to 2024-2025. Specifically, this bill alters existing funding allocations for the next three years using an indexation rate, resulting in an additional appropriation of $844 million to 2024-25. I welcome this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does not affect the substance of the act or operations of the ARC at all, and more's the pity, because some of the finest minds in the Australian research community tell us that reform is indeed needed. Let's see why they'd say that. Late last year, after months of delays, successful ARC Discovery projects were announced on Christmas Eve, with 587 projects approved for funding out of 3,096 applications. While the nation was sleeping, 587 projects were slipped under the tree. This long, drawn-out process was led by the ARC College of Experts, highly skilled, extraordinarily competent, credentialled people eminent in their fields. They worked through more than 3,000 applications, short-listed them and then recommended them for funding. The list then went to the minister for education. So it was the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. But there was some stirring, and six projects never made it down the chimney to the Christmas tree. They went up in ministerial smoke. The acting education minister, Mr Robert, exercised his right to overrule the rigorous ARC review. Minister Robert decided that six of the expert panel recommended grants for research relating to climate activism and China were not, in his view, in the national interest. He put his ministerial red ink through them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been a researcher who has been through the ARC process. I've spent countless hours on writing grant applications, extensive literature reviews, careful collation of research teams' publication records and CVs, endless meetings, project planning rationale, compilation of budgets, proposed student scholarships, and collaborations with other departments and universities. Then comes the first assessment and ranking, then writing, and writing again, rejoinders. Then comes more waiting. Announcement dates are delayed, lives are put on hold and postdoctoral students, in December, are left wondering if they'll have a job in the following months. It means suspended planning and lives on hold. All of this is in an environment where university researchers experience less and less career certainty. We have heard speakers in this chamber this afternoon detailing the brain drain to other nations. All of this is in an environment where universities were excluded from JobKeeper. Finally, then, imagine having made the cut, being a winner in the field where less than 20 per cent have success, and being one of the team in those six projects rejected by the minister on the basis that they did not, in his view, demonstrate value for taxpayers' money or contribute to the national interest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Lynette Russell, a historian at Monash University and current ARC laureate fellow, described the minister's veto as 'a significant constraint against academic freedom'. Let's be clear about who such laureates are. Laureate fellowships are awarded by the ARC to the most respected professors in their fields, with only 17 granted yearly. Professor Russell said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whether it be the test of 'national interest' or an excessive focus on a sector like manufacturing, research funding in Australia is becoming political and short-sighted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The best return comes from letting researchers focus on curiosity-driven research. This has given us mRNA vaccines, the laser, and many other inventions that have lifted the quality of our lives.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Brian Schmidt, the Nobel-Prize-winning astrophysicist and Australian National University vice-chancellor, in his state of the university address said there had been only 'four known occurrences of political interference' in the ARC's grant process, three of which were in the last three years. He went on to say:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My strong view, a view held by many university leaders, whether they say it out loud or not, is Australia needs an apolitical system to allocate research funding and a review of the Australian Research Council.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Schmidt said political interference can 'corrupt knowledge and slow down its creation'. He argued that academic independence is 'one of democracy's key advantages over other forms of government'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A petition with nearly 1,500 signatories—including those of high-profile authors JM Coetzee, Michelle de Kretser, Alexis Wright and Amanda Lohrey—has called for Minister Robert to reinstate the defunded projects and commit to legislating the complete independence of the ARC from government interference and censorship. They said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That two-thirds of the six censored grants should be in literary studies demonstrates a dismissive attitude to the value of the imagination and creativity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The actions of the government reveal that it is committed to defunding Australia's literary culture by overriding academic autonomy and determining what kinds of knowledge can and cannot be pursued. This is especially ironic given its recent campaign to defend freedom of speech on Australia's campuses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear here: both major parties agree it is appropriate for the minister to wield this power. But I, alongside all of these esteemed academics, would say it is time for this to be reviewed. A Senate inquiry will now examine the power of ministers to veto research funding, after the Greens successfully referred to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee their bill seeking to remove the power. Submissions to that inquiry close on 25 February, and I urge anyone out there who, like me, is concerned about ministerial interference to make a submission to that parliamentary inquiry. Thank you.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Research Council is Australia's independent research agency. Its purpose is to grow knowledge and innovation for the benefit of the community by funding the highest-quality research. The ARC runs a competitive grants process over a number of grant schemes. The process is arduous. The previous speaker, the member for Indi, spoke of this and of her personal experience of that process. It goes through the highest standard of peer review. Applications take many months to put together and they take many more months to review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I worked in the university sector for nearly 10 years. My first job in that sector was at the University of Western Australia, where I was a research contracts lawyer. One of the first tasks I had in that role was to develop contracts for successful applicants for Linkage Projects. Linkage Projects, through the ARC, involve academics working with industry and the university, with in-kind contributions, to develop a particular line of research. I also worked on developing agreements around centres of excellence, and, though I did not do the agreements for Discovery Projects grants, I had a lot to do with the many academics that pursue Discovery grants, which are, in this country, the principal mechanism to fund basic research in the humanities and the sciences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Discovery grants are extremely competitive. The success rate is only 19 per cent. In fact, Discovery grants are harder to get than any kind of grant a Liberal government might give to someone in a safe Labor seat! Linkage grants involve, as I said, close collaboration and partnership with industry. In round 2 in 2020, the success rate was nearly 26 per cent. These grants are hard to come by. It takes a lot of effort even to get your application in, to get it through the rejoinder process, and there are many, many minds that work on these—the applicants themselves, but also the teams of research grants officers who help academics and their entire teams work through this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The peer review process is also arduous. Each proposal is about 50 to 100 pages, and each one is assessed by two members of the ARC College of Experts. They take their job seriously and read every single word. There's no colour-coded spreadsheet for the ARC College of Experts. Members of this college literally receive suitcases of applications under the ARC Discovery grants process; that's how competitive it is. It takes months, reading every single night, to get through these very extensive and expansive applications. Those applications then get reviewed again by four subject experts. This is a trusted, thorough, arduous and thoughtful process that has developed over many years. But this government shuns a well-established trusted process in favour of its own personal political assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The acting education minister rejected six humanities grants on unsupported grounds of not contributing to the national interest and not demonstrating value for money—this from Minister Robert, the member for Fadden, who charged the Australian taxpayer $1,000 a month for mobile broadband services. Where is the value for money in a $38,000 internet bill? And when did the minister make this announcement? It was on Christmas Eve last year. This is the longest delay in announcing ARC grant recipients in 30 years. You've got to ask: What are these people doing? What is the government doing? They have a college of experts and a thorough independent review process. They get their recommendations and do nothing with them, or they fiddle about with them. Who really knows? Ultimately, they make a political decision to grab a little soundbite in the middle of the night so that they can make an attack on academics, who are already under severe pressure given that this government failed to support them through the pandemic. As we know, thousands of research jobs have been lost around this country, and 40,000 jobs have been lost within the higher education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the longest delay in the notification of grants in 30 years. But perhaps the ARC Discovery grant applicants are even a little bit lucky that the member for Aston has been stood aside as education minister. That particular cultural warrior may have gone even further than Minister Robert. The truth is that there's a long history of interference in the ARC independent processes by the Liberal Party of Australia. Brendan Nelson, as the minister, vetoed three in seven applications. Senator Simon Birmingham, as the relevant minister, vetoed 11 ARC humanities grants. They play stupid, harmful games by picking titles that will get them a headline and maybe a bit of a clap and a cheerio from some of the shock jocks around this country. In doing so, they disrespect the literally thousands of hours of work conducted by researchers in universities right across this nation and that of their peers, the senior academics, the leaders of our research institutions that review these applications night after night. They think it's a little bit of a joke to pull out some seven-word title and dismiss the hundreds of pages of tens of thousands of words and the years and years of research that sit behind it. It's disgusting and it has to stop. It's wasteful, it's stupid, it's unfair, and it holds back Australian science.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say a few words to conclude on the matter of science and commercialisation. I studied at university and worked there for 10 years amongst academics and academic scientists. From being around that system and from general reading, I've learned that you can't boss around science. Discovery happens as it happens, but it always happens on the back of years and years of hard work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commercialisation of scientific discovery is important, but it is not everything, and it never will be. Not all science or scientific discovery can be commercialised. Take the discovery that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Helicobacter pylori</span> bacterium plays a major role in causing most peptic ulcers. The work of the South Australian great Robin Warren AC and the Western Australian great Barry Marshall AC worked against commercial interest that produced medications and expensive surgeries to treat ulcers. Ulcers were thought to be a product of stress, and many people around the world spent thousands of dollars on psychiatric assessments and psychological appointments to try and beat ulcers. There was a groundswell of commercial interest that tried to defy the findings of Barry Marshall and Robin Warren. What Barry Marshall and Robin Warren proved was that ulcers could be cured by antibiotics. This simple discovery—it was not a simple discovery; it was years of testing and, famously, even self-testing—changed the lives of millions of people around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two Australian scientists were working in Fremantle Hospital, Royal Perth Hospital and the University of Western Australia many years ago, beavering away, trying to get funding just like everyone else tries to do in a very competitive research system. A complex discovery, complex to discover, changed the lives of millions once they had proved it—of course, Barry proved it on himself. They quite rightly were rewarded with the 2005 Nobel Prize for medicine. This is a scientific discovery that won't make money. It saves people money. It saves individuals money. People who get peptic ulcers and other stomach complaints now know that they can have a simple test for <span style="font-style:italic;">He</span><span style="font-style:italic;">licobacter pylori</span> bacterium, they can take a round of antibiotics and they will more than likely feel much better; they don't have to go through gastric surgery or other kinds of treatments that often make people's lives much worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, I would ask that education ministers in this government have a real think about how they treat scientists in this country—how they disregard their thoughtful and long-term work and their extraordinary effort when they put in these applications—and not dismiss the extraordinary work that goes into each and every Australian Research Council grant application. I thank the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  I thank all members and senators who have spoken in relation to the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2021. The bill amends the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to ensure the continuity of the funding scheme of the Australian Research Council, the ARC. This bill is a routine matter that updates the existing funding caps and inserts new funding caps through until 30 June 2025 to provide for anticipated inflationary growth and the cost of Australian research supported by the ARC. The new cap for the 2021-22 financial year has been increased to just over $815 million, and a new paragraph has been added to provide appropriations, as per agreed Commonwealth policy, to the 2024-25 financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government values the important role played by university research in the creation of new knowledge and new social and economic citizens, and as a platform for our engagement with intellectual and practical challenges facing the world. Of course, as you will know, Deputy Speaker, in my portfolio area innovation and technology are a driving force for good as we reduce our emissions as part of a global solution towards sustainability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ARC is an important funder of industry linked research at our universities—research with real-world impacts to accelerate Australia's innovation agenda. Schemes under the ARC's Linkage Program require industry partners to provide matching funding to leverage funding provided by the Australian government. These schemes encourage and extend cooperative approaches to research and improve the use of research outcomes by strengthening links within Australia's innovation system and with innovation systems internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ARC funding has supported many tangible long-term industry collaborations. For instance, a team led by Professor Michael Breadmore at the University of Tasmania has worked for over 20 years on great innovation to develop the world's first mobile device that can rapidly detect the chemical signature of inorganic homemade explosives—an interesting and important part of research that twins with national security. A spin-off company, GreyScan Australia Pty Ltd, has now been formed and is selling the device for use by first responders and checkpoint operatives in a variety of detection scenarios, including military, public security, cargo and mail screening, passenger screening, commercial premises and, of course, major events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ARC's Industrial Transformation Research Program funds research hubs and training centres to support higher-degree research students and postdoctoral researchers in gaining real-world, practical skills and experience through placement in industry. One of the challenges that's always existed is making sure that academics get practical and real-world experience, not just because of the benefits to them but also because of the knowledge transfer that occurs into industry. In the context of primary research, I draw members' attention to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Many members might forget that it has an industrial capacity—to take ideas and develop them all the way through to commercialisation and scalability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These hubs and centres fund research in the priority areas: advanced manufacturing; cybersecurity; defence; food and beverages; agribusiness; medical technologies and pharmaceuticals; mining equipment; resource technology and services; critical minerals processing, which is one of the most important sectors not just for Australia's research and industrial capacity but also for national security interests; oil, gas and energy resources; recycling and clean energy; and space. These priority areas reflect the Australian government's commitment to developing critical industry sectors and to supporting collaboration between universities and industry. An example of these centres working in the advanced manufacturing and clean energy space is the ARC Training Centre in Future Energy Storage Technologies, led by Professor Maria Forsyth, at Deakin University. The researchers and their industry collaborators at this training centre are determined that the next breakthrough battery technology will have a manufacturing home here in Australia—and thank the Maker for that! The centre is also training industry-ready graduates who will become the next generation of renewable energy industry leaders in Australia—something we should all be excited about. There are already around 100 of these training centres and research hubs established in Australian universities, with funding of up to $5 million each provided by the ARC and with significant additional funding and support from industry partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These centres are breaking down the barriers between the ivory towers and real-world applications and charging Australian industry with the world-leading engineering and innovation talent of our universities. The Australian government's support for the ARC is enabling this transformation to occur in our innovation system. Successive Australian governments have made a sustained and significant investment in high-quality research within our university sector, which has contributed to its success and recognition internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank members for their contributions and for supporting the government's continued commitment to the higher education and research sector. I do so because, on behalf of the whole House, this conversation is critically important when we look at the big challenges faced by not just our country but the global community. With the challenges and risks that are presented to the world on so many fronts, the solution is going to be the role of our scientists and innovators in technology, which is going to help and advance humanity. Particularly when we look at the challenges affecting us as a result of climate change, we see it's going to be so important that we harness the power of technology and integrate it in the heart of our economy. That way we can not just continue to innovate, prosper and grow but be part of the global solution, both helping ourselves and helping the world cut its greenhouse gas emissions footprint in the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's going to be our research scientists and innovators who are going to take these ideas from gestation to development, commercialisation and scalability, whether it's the potential role for different forms of hydrogen in industrial capacity and export, as we move away from traditional fossil fuels to new and dynamic types of fuels, or where it's ammonia. It's going to be the vehicles that we utilise in the same space through to what's necessary for freight, with potential for air and road transport too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In every space of the economy and society, we are going to face new challenges. The question for us is going to be how we respond to them. Universities can work in partnership with our research institutes as well as local communities. When I speak to various business leads and local mayors around the country about how they see their economic opportunity up to 2050, all of them talk about partnerships as part of the solution, and research is part of that conversation as well. It's on that basis that the government remains utterly committed to the focus on higher education and research sectors as part of building Australia's future economy. It's something that it has done in past, something we are rightly proud of, and something we wish to see continue into the future. It's on that basis that I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pension Loans Scheme lets older Australians get a loan from the government to supplement their retirement income. It is an important program offering older Australians another option for improving their retirement income. Established in 1985, the scheme is a legacy of the Hawke government, but take-up rates for the scheme have been low, primarily due to a number of barriers to access. These barriers are well known and have been known for the nine years of this government. They include: not being accessible to all older Australians who own their home; the complexities of the loan scheme being difficult to understand and navigate; a lack of safeguards against securing excessive debt; high interest rates on the loans; and cultural concerns Australians have around protecting the family home in retirement and around family inheritance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2018-19 budget the government announced it was finally moving to introduce legislation to address the low take-up rate. Labor welcomed and supported the changes, and take-up rates did improve—moving from 780 participants in 2018 to over 5,000 participants in September 2021. But this improvement is against a potential pool of around four million Australians of age-pension age, including around two million pensioners who own their own home. So this result is not good enough. Many pensioners are asset rich but cash poor. They are struggling to make ends meet and would benefit from options offered under the scheme. Many older Australians living in retirement homes have contacted me to say having access to this scheme would make a big difference to their quality of life. The government's actions demonstrate they know just how far short their previous efforts to improve this scheme have fallen.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces two new features to the scheme. Firstly, it introduces a new safeguard: the no negative equity guarantee. This will prevent the Commonwealth from recovering the amount of the debt exceeding the value of the asset. Secondly, it allows participants to access a portion of their payments annually as a lump sum advance. This change will help older Australians to make larger purchases such as extra support or to make home modifications. These are improvements to the scheme, and Labor welcomes them. They are changes that could and should have been made earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government committed in the last budget to a campaign to raise awareness of the scheme. Crucially, they have kept secret just how much they plan to spend on this campaign. I think every Australian would have questions about this government spending an unknown amount of public money on advertising during an election year. This is a government that thinks of ad campaigns first and policies second. That's why this measure comes up with a branding effort, changing the name of the scheme from the Pension Loans Scheme to the Home Equity Access Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At MYEFO, the government further reduced the interest rate, to a level more in line with other mortgages: 3.95 per cent. Labor supports the reduction of the interest rate, but it comes way too late. Participants have been paying interest rates higher than those for almost every other mortgage across Australia for years. Worse still, Labor knows these higher interest rates have been indirectly contributing, as a savings measure, to the government's budget repair policy. These are savings made off the back of older Australians, including full-rate pensioners. Labor believes the changes in the bill are another job half done and another missed opportunity to fully address all the well-known and identified barriers that stop pensioners taking up this scheme and improving their quality of life in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis by the University of New South Wales shows that, whilst these changes will make a modest difference, much more work remains to make sure access is easy for those who need it. Too many older Australians in retirement homes and other communities have no access to this scheme. This lack of access is unfair. Addressing it will take some work—work that a government which cared about making a difference instead of an announcement would already have done.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners won't be fooled by the government's half-hearted attempts to support them. They know that this is a government that has tried to cut the age pension and reduce the living standards of pensioners at every opportunity. In fact, to improve the budget bottom line, this government has tried to cut the pension and increase the pension age to 70 in almost every one of its nine budgets, including the three budgets where the current Prime Minister had the job of Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2014 budget, they tried to cut pension indexation, a cut that would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 a week less within 10 years. This unfair cut would have ripped $23 billion from the pockets of pensioners in Australia, affecting every single pensioner. In the 2014 budget, they cut $1 billion from pensioner concession support that was designed to help pensioners with the cost of living. In the same budget, they axed the $900 seniors supplement to self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card. In the 2014 budget, the coalition government tried to reset deeming rate thresholds, a cut that would have seen 500,000 part-pensioners made worse off. In 2015, they did a deal with the Greens to change the pension asset test and cut the pension to around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year. So many part-pensioners lost their pension because of this coalition-Greens saving measure. In the 2016 budget, they also tried to cut the pension for over 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. The government's own figures showed this would have left over 563,000 Australians currently receiving a pension or an allowance worse off. Over 10 years, in excess of 1.5 million pensioners would have been worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of all this, the government spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70. They waited four years before adjusting the deeming rates for age pensioners, despite the Reserve Bank continually reducing its rate for the same period, another indirect savings measure for the government. The coalition still have cuts to pensions in the parliament. They want to completely take the pension supplement away from pensioners who go overseas for more than six weeks. This will see around $120 million ripped from the pockets of pensioners. They still want to make pensioners born overseas wait longer before qualifying for the age pension by increasing the residency requirement from 10 to 15 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Spiralling out-of-pocket healthcare costs are a big concern for older Australians. These have increased because of the Medicare freeze put in place by the coalition government. No-one spends nine years, including three as Treasurer, trying to cut the pension and increasing the pension age to 70 unless it is what they really believe in. Pensioners know they can't trust the Morrison-Joyce government if they are to protect their living standards and act to offset the rising costs of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have gone through three leaders in their nine long years in office. No matter who the leader has been, cutting your pension has been an enduring priority. Cutting the pension is in their DNA. But Labor's support for older Australians is unswerving, so we welcome the changes in this bill and we will not stand in the way of the bill. We have moved a second reading amendment. We will support older Australians, and our support is unswerving, as I've said. We welcome the changes in this bill and the interest rate reduction announced at MYEFO, but more work is needed to enable all older Australians of age pension age to access the scheme and untap the equity in their homes to improve their retirement income and enhance their quality of life.</span>

                    <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021. I totally reject the amendment put forward by the previous member, which frames the government as having failed badly on pensioners and older people in Australia. I reject that entirely, but I think this bill is a good move. It addresses some of those great problems, those conundrums, that people and the nation have to manage. How we fund the retirement of people in Australia to the level at which they would like to have their retirement funded is a challenge for them and a challenge for us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Age pensions were established in Australia at the beginning of the last century, in about 1909. At that time, when life expectancy was about 50, it was for people who reached the ripe old age of 65, so there weren't actually all that many people who went on the age pension back in 1910. If you survived that long then you claimed your pension. Today, of course, the pension is available from the age of 66½ heading to 67. I note the comments of the previous member about the coalition trying to extend that to the age of 70. It was, of course, the Labor Party that extended it from 65 to 67. But it is what it is, and I don't think that's a bad age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Life expectancy is now 82.9 years—almost 83 years—which leaves a gap of around 16 years in which people may draw an age pension, and that is the challenge that is facing the nation. It has been addressed over the long term by investment in superannuation, but I think Australians would be surprised to learn that, of that cohort of people in excess of 65 years old who are in the bracket of being eligible for the age pension, only 62 per cent actually draw on it. That would probably be surprising to most Australians. I'm sure you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, have gone into an office and people have asked what your pension number is, as they assume everybody is on the pension. That is far from the case. If 62 per cent are drawing their age pension, it stands to reason that around 38 per cent are not, and I think this is the great success of the policies of a number of governments. Compulsory superannuation was brought in by a Labor government under Paul Keating—I think he was the Treasurer at the time, in fact—at a rate of four per cent. It increased to nine per cent in 2002 under a different government and now it's drawing its way northward again, and the current rate is 10 per cent and that is happening under a Liberal government, a coalition government. So there is broad support across the political parties for the notion of compulsory superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting that there has also been an explosion in the net wealth of older Australians making voluntary contributions through superannuation. I'm sometimes put upon by a senior Australian saying, 'Well, what are you doing for independently funded retirees?' What we do for independently funded retirees is to have this amazing system where the taxpayer subsidises your contributions into superannuation, whether that is done in the compulsory manner or voluntarily. The 15 per cent flat tax gives the means for senior Australians to actually set up their financial affairs as they head towards retirement in a situation where they pay no tax. That has been subsidised by the taxpayer. I'm certainly not decrying that, but I think people should understand that's how this very generous scheme by world standards has come about. It's led to that drop-off in the number of people drawing on the age pension in their older years, which is, of course, the safety net. That safety net is designed to give a good standard of living, not a luxurious one by any means but a reasonable standard of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An interesting way that the age pension is set is that it is not set by any one indicator; it is set by whichever is the highest between the CPI or the aged-sector expenditure barrel or a percentage of male average weekly take-home earnings. That means that on any one of those criteria it rises faster than the other two. So it is a generous scheme in world context, and, as I say, it provides a good standard of living but not a magnificent one, which is where this legislation and the personal loan against the family home scheme sits in place. We should celebrate what we've done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, the pension for singles, with the supplementary payments, stands at $967 a fortnight. For couples it stands at $729 each or a combination of $1,458 a fortnight. So I think we can safely assume that's the lowest rate of pay for people who are over the age of 66½ at the moment. The pension is brought down on a sliding scale according to your assets and income, assuming you are earning an income from your assets. That's the base rate. But, of course, the family home in Australia is not included in the assets test, and 80 per cent of Australians over the age of 65 own their own home. Again, this is a tremendous achievement on a global scale. In Australia it is still one of the things that we aspire to—to own our own home. Successive governments have recognised that that is a separate investment to everything else that a person can lay their hands on, so the family home is not included in the assets test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in the last 10 years—in fact, in the last 20, 30 or 40 years or any time frame you'd like to look at—there has been a spectacular increase in the value of the family home. Over the last 10 years, it's perhaps been as much as $200,000 or $300,000 or $500,000. In Sydney, the median value of a Sydney residence is $1.3 million. It stands to reason that if your major asset is outside the pension requirements you should be able to utilise in some way the great increase in your wealth you've had by taking a risk at a younger age, saying: 'I will take on this debt. I will take on the challenge and I will pay off the family home.' Rather than having to spend a modest retirement, they might elect to spend a better financed retirement and get a little bit more in their later years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The obvious way into this is a reverse mortgage. They are available in the commercial market. But for many it's a pretty new concept. With a family home that they've scraped and saved for all their lives and consider to be sacrosanct, they venture into the commercial market with the mentality, 'I have worked for and paid for my house; why would I put it at risk?' It is of concern to them that somehow the market might turn against them and they might end up losing their family home or they might end up losing the value of the family home because they've drawn down on it in their retirement. It's a fairly unlikely outcome given the track record of real estate in Australia, but you can understand why it is a real concern for these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So government stepped into that space some years ago and provided the Pension Loans Scheme, where, rather than taking your loan out against the bank you take it out from the federal government. It's breaking the ice in this area. But this amendment actually eliminates that fairly remote possibility that the owner may overdraw the value of their property, resulting in they or their estates actually owing a debt to the Commonwealth. I don't think it will be a game-changer, but I think it is sensible legislation and it carries, I think, minimal risk for the Commonwealth and the taxpayer. This is to get more people to recognise that this is part of their wealth that they generated during their life and that there's no particular reason to leave it entirely intact for a second generation. Of course we would all like to leave our children a good start in life, but it is not incumbent upon the current taxpayer that they be funding somebody in the future. So it's a choice they can make. It's not compulsory. This should make it a little more friendly. The no-negative-equity guarantee will provide peace of mind to retirees that, whatever happens, they will not accumulate debt in this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment also allows for a lump sum in advance twice a year. They can access, in total, for the year, up to 50 per cent of the current maximum rate of the pension back against that reverse mortgage, that offset against the family home. In the case of a single person, that would be $12,580 and, in the case of a couple, it would be $18,960 to supplement their pension. For a couple, that would put them in excess of $50,000, which is a pretty tidy income. My view is that, if you have that kind of income, why wouldn't you use it to enjoy your retirement years? So I absolutely commend the legislation and the minister for putting it forward, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

It allows older people in our community who are asset rich but income poor to have a source of income. But, of course, like everything under this government, it's been botched, and now we are dealing with a bill that attempts to fix a couple of the problems in the dying days of this parliament so that, in another case of spin and marketing, the Morrison government can say it's done something for pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021 addresses some of the inadequacies of the current Pension Loans Scheme and, on that basis, deserves to be supported. But it doesn't address all the flaws in the scheme. And, as the member for Barton has made clear in her amendment, which I support, it doesn't make up for this government's neglect and mistreatment of pensioners over its many years in office. Changing the name of the Pension Loans Scheme is a typical move from this government. They have brought forth a bill to change not much more than the name of the scheme. The name of the scheme has been changed to the Home Equity Access Scheme. The bill also amends the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act to improve the flexibility of the scheme. Again, that is a change to be welcomed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill adds two new features to the scheme. There is a no-negative-equity guarantee so that participants don't repay more than the market value of their property regardless of their debt. This is a necessary protective requirement. It is in place for commercial reverse mortgage products and it should provide people some peace of mind around taking up this scheme. The bill also allows for two lump-sum advances in any 12-month period, with each lump sum being capped at 50 per cent of the maximum annual rate of the age pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are positive changes, but they probably don't do enough to drive uptake of the scheme, which remains at a really low level. There a number of reasons for that. A lot of them go to how people understand the scheme and how it has been promoted to them. It goes to cultural issues. It goes to the complexity of financial products. It goes to the interest rates that have been set by this government around it. And it also goes to who is able to access the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the unfinished pieces of business that doesn't seem to be addressed by this bill is that the Pension Loans Scheme still can't be accessed by residents of retirement villages, where people own their home but don't own the land the home is on. I see from many advocates for older Australians that that is something they would like to have addressed. Unfortunately, this has not been addressed as part of this change that the Morrison government is bringing forward. Again, it is typical of this government that in drafting a bill, in making changes, they failed to listen adequately and consult adequately with stakeholders about how they can best improve people's lives, particularly the lives of older Australians and pensioners in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Barton has outlined in her amendment, this government always gets it wrong when it comes to pensioners. They're focusing on a marketing effort with this bill by giving the scheme a new name. They're not doing the hard yards of actually doing the work to improve the scheme across the board and drive the uptake that would make it a success. These changes come in the dying days of this government, at least two years too late. During the past two years, participants in this scheme have been paying a higher interest rate than almost every mortgagee because this government is taking pensioners' money instead of doing the right thing by senior Australians. So now again we have a moment where I presume they have heard from their electorates, have spoken to pensioners, realise they have done the wrong thing by them and are trying desperately to fix that up before an election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be really clear that, in contrast to this government's last-minute efforts, Labor believes that this scheme can do good things for our country. It can do good things for older people and we would make it work for all older Australians. We would allow people to genuinely unlock their housing assets and improve their retirement income. And, of course, it is not just in fixing this scheme that a Labor government would be on the side of pensioners. Across the board, Labor would stand up for pensioners in a way that this government has just failed to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go through a quick review of the government's inaction on pensioners in their history in office. In the infamous 'slash and burn budget' of 2014 the government tried to cut pension indexation, which would have left pensioners living on some $80 a week less within 10 years—$23 billion would have been ripped from the pockets of the pensioners of Australia. This was what an earlier incarnation of this government was proposing to do to older Australians. In the same budget, the government cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions, axed the $900 senior supplement and tried to reset deeming rate thresholds. What a record! It goes on: in 2015 the government did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension for approximately 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension assets test. In the 2016 budget there were two things: an attempt to cut the pension to around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to restrict overseas travel for pensioners to six weeks, and trying to cut the pension for more than 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's record of policy misery for pensioners continues. They spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70 and waited four years before adjusting the deeming rates for age pensioners, even though the Reserve Bank continually reduced its rates over the same period. I can say with confidence that I hear about every time this government fails to adjust the deeming rates. I hear about what that means for older people in my electorate—the fact that they have been left consistently in a very unfair position by this government's failure to get deeming rates right over its time in office. This is the government that wants to axe the pension supplement from pensioners who go overseas for more than six weeks, which would see around $120 million ripped from the pockets of pensioners. These are people who might be looking for a family reunion trip to the old country. You can't do that and keep your pension. They want to make pensioners born overseas wait longer before qualifying for the age pension by increasing residency requirements from 10 to 15 years. Everything this government does seems to be designed to make the lives of pensioners harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Labor government would be different. I want to be really clear about how important pensioners and older Australians are in my community. It is a privilege to represent them in this place and to stand up for them. These are the people who built this country. We say it a lot in this place, but it doesn't seem to translate into action. They built this country and they deserve our respect. They deserve a pension system that they can rely on and that they can trust into the future. The track record of this government demonstrates that that is not what they have delivered. At every opportunity, the Morrison government and the Liberal-National governments that preceded it have taken the chance to try and slash and burn the pension. It's not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners deserve so much better than this government. They deserve so much better than a record of trying to squeeze or trying to take away a pension. Now a name change is meant to fix things in the dying days of this parliament. Pensioners deserve a government that understands they should be supported now and into the future; a government that is not obsessed with trying to find savings by squeezing the age pension wherever it can; a government that actually understands what it means to be responsible, to be living on a pension, to be budgeting on a pension, to rely on a pension for your day-to-day life and your participation in the community. This is something I hear very often from constituents in my electorate, particularly during the pandemic. Pensioners feel like this government just hasn't understood how their participation in the community has been impacted, and how the support for pensioners through this pandemic hasn't really recognised the fact that, like all of us, they were separated from loved ones and from community, and they don't feel supported by this government through this time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill goes some way to fixing this scheme, it doesn't far enough. I wholeheartedly endorse the amendment moved by the member for Barton. I urge this government to do better by the pensioners of Australia.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I rise to speak about the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021. This bill will increase the flexibility of the Pension Loans Scheme, giving senior Australians more options when drawing on the equity in their homes and other real estate assets to improve their living standard in retirement. The guarantee will apply to all scheme participants from 1 July 2022. The guarantee will mean that, when scheme participants settle their debt, they will not repay more than the equity in the property used to secure their loan. This measure will enhance the strong safeguards currently in place, such as conservative age based loan-to-value ratios that minimise the possibility of a participant's debt exceeding the equity in their secured property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are living more than 10 years longer than they were 50 years ago. We want our senior Australians to enjoy the best quality of life during their retirement, and one of the key factors in achieving this is financial independence. For many senior Australians, the age pension is a key source of retirement income, but, with housing prices increasing significantly in recent years, we are seeing many of our senior Australians becoming paper millionaires with limited ability to access the benefits of their appreciating assets. Since 2003, the median house price in Sydney has grown from around $524,000 to approximately $1.33 million, and in Melbourne from around $280,000 to approximately $973,000. Even in Mallee, prices have gone up significantly in the last few years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where the Pension Loans Scheme comes into play. The PLS was introduced in 1985 and is similar to a reverse mortgage or home equity release product. Like home equity release products available in the private market, the PLS enables Australians of age pension age to voluntarily unlock the equity in their home. It gives them the option of staying in their own home while boosting their retirement income. Importantly, people have complete discretion as to how they spend their money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019 the Morrison-Joyce government provided access to the scheme for all Australians of age pension age, including self-funded retirees and maximum rate pensioners. We also increased the amount available as a fortnightly loan. These changes have seen a fivefold increase in take-up over the last two years, and there are currently more than 5,000 participants in the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the PLS made through this bill will increase the flexibility of the scheme for senior Australians by providing a mechanism through which retirees can access capped lump sum amounts to meet unexpected and larger expenses. The introduction of a no-negative-equity guarantee will give participants confidence that they will not repay more than the equity they have in the property used to secure their loan when settling their debt. These changes will make the PLS a more flexible and attractive option for senior Australians in their retirement. To ensure senior Australians are aware of the scheme, its eligibility requirements and the changes made through this bill, the government will conduct an awareness campaign in the lead-up to implementation of the changes on 1 July this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's estimated that around 80 per cent of senior Australians over the age of 65 are homeowners. The changes introduced with this bill will give older Australians more freedom to enjoy their retirement. This could be the freedom to visit their grandkids post COVID, to purchase that one special thing they have always wanted, to make repairs to the house, or just to remove financial pressures in day-to-day life. Over time, these reforms and our world-leading home equity regulation will help change the way we view homeownership. Your home is more than simply a place to live; it is a store of value that can be released to boost retirement living standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how does it work? From 1 July 2022, participants in the scheme will be able to access up to two capped payments in any 26-fortnight period. Participants in the scheme will be able to access a portion of their payment as a lump sum advance. This will give retirees a new mechanism and greater flexibility to meet unexpected or substantial expenses. The maximum lump sum advance is capped at 50 per cent of the maximum fortnightly rate of age pension over the following 12 months—that is, 26 fortnights. Based on current age pension rates, the maximum advance payment will be around $12,500 for singles and around $18,964 for couples combined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Participants will be able to take up to two advances in any 26-fortnight period, with the combined total limited by the 50 per cent cap. Any advance taken will reduce the amount of the fortnightly Pension Loans Scheme payment received by a participant. The amount a participant can receive will generally be the same, regardless of whether they take an advance payment, fortnightly payments or a combination of both. This will protect participants from building excessive debt balances while providing them with flexibility on how they draw on their real estate assets for self-support. As with all financial products, it's important to note that people considering participating in the scheme are advised to seek independent financial advice to ensure the Pension Loans Scheme works for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Homeownership has always been the bedrock of our society. We know that most Australians want to stay in their own homes during retirement—often a place with decades of memories. We want to give older Australians the confidence to tap into a small proportion of their home equity to increase their retirement outcomes. This bill is all about giving our senior Australians more choice and control in their retirement lifestyle.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I rise to support the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021. The Pension Loans Scheme is a longstanding legacy of the Labor Hawke government. The Pension Loans Scheme is one of a wide range of Labor policies that have sought to ensure the safety and the dignity of older Australians as they move through the later stages of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The loans scheme allows older people who are asset rich but cash poor to access income. This is a position that a large number of older Australians find themselves in, as many find themselves having substantial financial assets in the form of a home or property ownership but without any steady cash income support. The purpose of the scheme, which was created under the Hawke government, is to enhance the living standards of senior Australians who are unable to access the age pension because they were unable to meet the income test. Whilst the Pension Loans Scheme provides an important capacity for older Australians to access an income in the later stages of their lives, in doing so, to maintain their quality of life, this program has suffered under the stewardship of the Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of barriers that prevent Australians from accessing the program in its current form. Equity, equality of access, the complexity of the available financial products and by-products, unintended consequences of safeguards against excessive debt, interest rates and cultural issues are all factors that contribute to the relatively low uptake of the Pension Loans Scheme. Despite each of these barriers being known for a substantial period of time and becoming more pronounced throughout the nine years of this Liberal-National government, the only notable reform we've seen to the scheme in recent years was through the modest changes made by the Turnbull government in the 2018-19 budget. These changes include expanding eligibility to full-rate pensioners and self-funded retirees, increasing the maximum fortnightly payment rate under the Pension Loans Scheme from 100 to 150 per cent of the full pension and the reduction of the interest rate from 5.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. We supported these changes as they meant that more senior Australians, including full-rate pensioners, could increase their income. These changes expanded the way in which older Australians were able to access the scheme and the amount of money available to them through it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House further expands the scheme. This bill introduces more financial safeguards and greater payment flexibility, allowing two annual advance lump sum payments to help participants with larger expenses. In the lead-up to the election, in 2021, the government finally gave up on one of its long-term efforts to improve the budget bottom line on the back of pensioners by reducing the interest rate to 3.5 per cent—something that has obviously been necessary for some time to bring equity to the system. However—there's always a 'however' with his government; there's always a 'but'—it has become predictable with the Morrison government that this bill and the government's effort focuses more on marketing effort than actual substance. The Pension Loans Scheme and the safeguards that our country puts in place to ensure the dignity and safety of Australians as they move through the latter stages of their lives require more than just a marketing strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pension Loans Scheme, an important Labor legacy that is crucial for older Australians to have access to income, requires more than just a new name in order to be sufficiently reformed, and provide a benefit to older Australians that it was intended to create. However, as happens so often with this government, the needs of older Australians are not considered or legislated for beyond the PR benefit that the Morrison government can achieve through announcements. It is crucial that older Australians have the capacity to live out their lives with dignity and with access to basic services and quality of life</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have repeatedly failed to fulfil this requirement, and their failure for older Australians has been even more stark throughout the course of this pandemic. A lack of care for older Australians and aged-care residents is endemic to the Morrison government. We have seen time and time again, throughout this pandemic, their sheer disregard for the lives and the wellbeing of older Australians and aged-care residents. The botched vaccine rollout for aged-care residents and staff, and the ongoing lack of support for those within the aged-care sector—through lack of PPE, lack of booster shots and lack of support for staff—send a clear message from the Morrison government that the needs of older Australians are not a priority. Throughout their time in government, particularly through the course of the pandemic, the Liberal-National coalition have failed to listen to the stories and the experiences of older Australians and their families. The coalition have failed to legislate the very real changes which are necessary in order to reform the way in which this government treat those Australians who have retired and are moving on through the later stages of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's failure to truly address the needs of older Australians in this country extends far beyond this bill. One of the great examples of the failure of older Australians by this government is in the current state of the aged-care system. The government wants to claim to have put forward a plan that reforms the aged-care sector; but, beyond the smoke and mirrors, the government's response to the royal commission and to the mounting criticism of the current crisis within the aged-care system does not even fall short. It fails completely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposed policies fail to deliver the enduring forms and improvements necessary to address the crisis in the short and the long run. Labor's criticism of the Morrison government's response to the aged-care crisis is not politics. It is not about political mudslinging; it is about facts. The Morrison government have delayed or outright rejected many of the crucial recommendations that the royal commission put forth as necessary changes for the reform of this industry. Throughout the omicron wave of this pandemic, day after day, we've been hearing stories of understaffed aged-care centres, of patients being left unattended—in many cases without access to even the basic medical treatment and care—and of the overworked and exhausted staff who are doing their very best in a broken system. The government have done very little to truly address these issues facing older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In aged care, the government's plan includes none of the recommended workforce and workplace changes that the royal commission outlined as necessary aspects of addressing the growing crisis within the industry. There's nothing to improve wages for the overstretched and undervalued aged-care workers. Similarly, with regard to the Pension Loans Scheme, which is the subject of this bill, there is very little done to address the core constraints faced by Australians in accessing the Pension Loans Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor welcomes any changes that have the capacity to improve access of older Australians to a reliable income and financial security, the bill proposed by the Morrison government does not do enough to reform a fundamentally broken system which has been created under this government's watch. Older Australians face a myriad of challenges in accessing adequate care and quality of life. It is disappointing that the government has procrastinated on so many issues facing older Australians. The budget and MYEFO changes, which are the subject of this bill, come two years too late. Participants have been paying higher interest rates than almost any mortgage, a saving measure for the budget off the back of senior Australians, including full-rate pensioners. Having such high interest rates has acted as a disincentive for many older Australians to access the scheme, and Labor believes that this scheme allowing people to unlock their housing assets to improve their retirement income should be fair and easy access for all senior Australians. As I said, the government has again missed an opportunity to introduce real change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows the government needs to address outstanding cultural barriers to see real change in the take-up rates. The Morrison government needs to do better in addressing the issues which continue to bar many Australians from accessing the Pension Loans Scheme. Many tens of thousands of Australians live in land lease communities. These Australians own their own home, but, because they do not own the land, they are unable to access the scheme. This is unfair. The government must look at this issue and make further changes and open the scheme for these Australians. There are also many known cultural barriers that inhibit some Australians from accessing the scheme, yet the Morrison government has done very little to address these issues. Older Australians will not be fooled by these well-timed changes made by the Morrison government in this bill. Although there are positive changes to the loan scheme within this bill that provide some benefit to older Australians, cutting the pension is in the Liberals' DNA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National coalition have tried to cut the pension and increase the pension age to 70 in every budget, including the three budgets where the current Prime Minister had the job of Treasurer. In the 2014 budget they tried to cut pension indexation. Had they been successful with that cut, it would have meant that pensioners would have been forced to live on $80 a week less within the next two years. This unfair cut would have ripped $23 billion from the pockets of every single pensioner in this nation. In the 2014 budget the government tried to cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions—support designed to help pensioners with the cost of living. They axed the $900 seniors supplement to self-funded retirees receiving a seniors health card, and they tried to reset the deeming rates threshold—a cut that would have seen 500,000 part-pensioners made worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015 the government cut the pension to around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the assets test. In the 2016 budget they tried to cut the pension to around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to limit overseas travel for pensioners to six weeks. They also tried to cut pension for over 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners—a supplement which actually helped pensioners keep their homes warm during winter and cool during summer. Why you would want to go and attack pensioners is beyond me, but that is the DNA of this government. The government's own figures show they would have left 563,000 Australians currently receiving a pension or allowance worse off. Over 10 years, in excess of 1.5 million pensioners would be worse off under this Liberal-National government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> If all those attempts to cut the pension and diminish the quality of life for older Australians weren't enough, the Liberal government has spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70. Of course they waited four years before adjusting the deeming rate for age pensioners, despite the Reserve Bank continually reducing its rate at the same period. On top of all that, the Morrison government has repeatedly taken steps aimed at phasing the cashless welfare card into use for the age pension. It is an offensive and dehumanising step, further robbing older Australians of dignity in autonomy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Older Australians need a government that truly has their best interests at heart. Spiralling out-of-pocket healthcare costs are a big concern for older Australians, because of the Medicare freeze put in place by this coalition government. Pensioners know they cannot trust Liberal governments. As I said, cutting the pension is in the DNA of the Liberal Party, and ignoring the needs of older Australians—whether that be with regard to the pension, aged care or health care—is the Liberal Party's core belief. While the modest changes to the Pension Loans Scheme contained in this bill are being accepted by Labor, they are not enough to ensure the quality of life and security of older Australians. For that, we need a government that cares more about pensioners than about marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pension Loans Scheme is a legacy of one of the great Labor governments, and Labor's ongoing support for this legislation is a reflection of our well-established history of legislating for the interests of older Australians. Older Australians deserve respect, compassion and care. Once again, the Morrison government, in this bill, is failing to provide that for them. It has never been more clear that an Albanese Labor government is what this country needs and what Australians, especially older Australians who helped to build this country, deserve.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  Once again I stand tonight on a very critical piece of legislation, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021, which deals with the welfare of older Australians who are relying on the pension. We have the Labor Party yet again playing games by moving a second reading amendment. They know it. The member opposite knows it. Yet they can't help themselves. There is nothing that they will not play games on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here, once again, we have an opportunity to debate how to make the lives of ordinary Australians, people who spent their entire working lives saving for their retirement, better, and we have the Labor Party moving a second reading amendment so they can post on their stupid, silly and idiotic website run by that front group the OpenAustralia Foundation, which will no doubt say that every member of the House on this side strongly—as though I get to say, 'Mr Speaker, I'm not just voting for this but strongly voting for this'—voted against the welfare of pensioners. Let's be very clear about that. This is dishonest politics by the Labor Party. These are untruths. This is misinformation. This is the sort of stuff they accuse Clive Palmer of doing day in and day out, and they do it, and they don't try to stop it. They're in this parliament enabling it.</span>

The Labor Party can't come in here and move second reading amendments so that they can facilitate the misinformation that the OpenAustralia Foundation goes on with all the time. The member opposite can carry on as much as he likes about it, but he is just as guilty of using this parliament not for debate or for actually improving the lives of pensioners but for simply playing undergraduate political games. You don't like being called out on it, but the truth is I'm going to stand here on every piece of legislation and call you out on it, because what you have been doing over the last five years is appalling and it denigrates our democracy, and frankly you all should be ashamed of yourselves. Sorry, those opposite should be ashamed of themselves, because they take votes from the crossbench, who—as we found out about this today on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, from the award-winning journalist Rob Harris, who has clearly undertaken months of investigation to understand this—vote 88 per cent of the time with the Labor Party and say that they're in favour of the climate, integrity and transparency.</span>

Their amendments are about playing undergraduate games with the future of older Australians, and I will go back to where I was rudely interrupted before, no doubt, the member for Moreton calls quorum on me, because that's their usual next tactic when they hear something they don't like hearing about, which is how they take the votes from someone who has been receiving donations from a coal investor who bought a coalmine from Eddie Obeid—who had an adverse finding in the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption—who then split that one transaction amongst eight members of their family.</span>

                    </a>  Mr Deputy Speaker, I continue to be relevant to the second reading amendment moved by those opposite and I encourage them to stop playing their puerile undergraduate political games of moving these second reading amendments so that they can post on some puerile undergraduate misinformation website that those on this side of the House don't support pensioners. And that's the problem. That's the problem right here. That's the problem with the donations. That's the problem with their speeches. That's the problem with their tactics. They don't want to talk about what the real issues are, because they're only about misinformation, hiding things and not telling the Australian people what's really going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had speeches from those opposite—literally all of them incorrect. We've had those opposite trying to claim that this government has been trying to institute the cashless debit card for pensioners. That is untrue. They continue to repeat it online. Why do they continue to do that? Because they're part of an institutional political movement that can only win votes by misinforming the Australian people. If they want to have a genuine debate about how to make the lives of pensioners better, everyone on this side is up for it. But they want to move second reading amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are those opposite making the absurd claim that we're responsible for trying to increase the age limit for the pension. Everyone in Australia knows that Wayne Swan began that process under the Rudd-Gillard government. Somehow those opposite are trying to fit up this side of the House with it. Once again, they'll have all their little front groups out there making that claim. They might make a political point; they might get the money from the coal investors who bought their mine from Eddie Obeid, and, nine times out of 10, they might actually be able to hide that from the Australian people. But the Australian people are no fools. They know when they're not being told the truth. They know that for decades this government has been the one side of this House that has supported and enhanced the lives of ordinary Australians on the pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that the pension wasn't started by the Whitlam government, as those opposite assert. Australians know that it was started by the Menzies government, when it was about caring and being compassionate towards those seeking to retire. Australians know that this side of the House has consistently and constantly fought for measures that support those people who have spent their lives trying to make their retirement more comfortable—for example, section 56(2) the Superannuation Industry (Supervision Act) 1993, which was designed to fine trustees because they had done something wrong and stop them from paying that fine out of members' funds. Let me make that clear: stealing money from ordinary Australians' retirement savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Thursday, we found out that almost a quarter of a billion dollars has been taken out of the retirement accounts of ordinary Australians by industry super funds. And why? Because, as APRA confirmed for us, Australia's largest super fund, AustralianSuper, was apparently one administrative error away from being insolvent. Is there no-one on that side of the House interested in the fact that $233 billion worth of retirement savings of ordinary Australians is run by a company with $12 in share capital? APRA doesn't seem interested, because of legislative changes moved by those on that side. Don't come into this chamber and try to hoodwink Australians into believing that you care about the climate when you're taking money from coalminers, that you care about honesty and integrity when you didn't declare that, and that that coal investor bought his coalmine from Eddie Obeid. Don't come into this chamber and claim that you care about Australian pensioners but that you don't actually care about the fact that the largest superannuation fund in Australia is run by a company with $12 in share capital while it manages $233 billion in retirement savings for ordinary Australians. And the reason you don't care is that they donate to your political party. Don't come into this chamber and make claims that you care about pensioners or that the cashless—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021 and in support of the amendment moved by the member for Barton. There must be an election coming, and some members opposite are feeling under pressure, because this third-term government is finally taking some long-overdue action on the Pension Loans Scheme—or Home Equity Access Scheme as it will now be known. Unfortunately, once again, it appears to be too little, too late.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pension Loans Scheme is a legacy of the Hawke Labor government. It was intended to allow older Australians who are asset rich but cash poor to access additional income if they missed out on the full age pension because of the assets test. The Pension Loans Scheme is effectively a reverse mortgage, administered and distributed by Services Australia. The initial payments above any age pension entitlement accrue as a debt secured against real estate the person owns, such as the family home or an investment property. As with a commercial reverse mortgage, participants can stay in their family home and do not have to repay the loan while living there. The government generally recovers the debt when the property securing the loan is sold or from the person's estate after they pass away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2018-19 budget the government made changes including expanding eligibility to full-rate pensioners and self-funded retirees; increasing the maximum fortnightly payment rate under the Pension Loans Scheme from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of the full pension; and reducing the interest rate from 5.2 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Labor supported these changes as they meant more senior Australians, including full-rate pensioners, could survive in the face of the rising cost of living. The cost of living is a real concern among older Australians in the electorate that I represent on the Central Coast of New South Wales, where one in five people is aged over 65. Dobell, the northern part of the Central Coast, is home to over 22,000 people relying on the age pension for some or all of their income, and there are over 2,500 self-funded retirees holding a Commonwealth seniors health card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the current arrangements, a full-rate pensioner can increase their income by up to $12,580 for singles or $18,960 for couples combined per year, based on the current rates of pension. Self-funded retirees can get up to 150 per cent of the maximum age pension. This bill introduces a no-negative-equity guarantee so participants would not pay more than the market value of their property, regardless of the debt. The bill will also allow for two lump-sum advances in any 12-month period. This will help people to meet larger expenses such as replacing a car or home improvements or renovations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports these amendments, but more could be done so more senior Australians could benefit from this scheme. In MYEFO 2021-22 the government finally gave up one of its long-term efforts to improve the budget bottom line at the expense of older Australians; it reduced the scheme's 4.5 per cent interest rate to 3.9 per cent, a change which came at least two years too late. Participants have been paying a higher interest rate than almost every mortgagee—a savings measure for the budget off the back of senior Australians during a pandemic, including full-rate pensioners who are struggling with the rising cost of living. The high interest rate is likely to have contributed to the low uptake of the scheme. Although some four million Australians are of age-pension age—including 2.6 million age pensioners, of whom around 80 per cent are homeowners—there are currently only 5,000 participants in the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes this scheme, allowing people to unlock their housing assets to improve their retirement income, should be fair and easy to access for all senior Australians. Unfortunately the government has again missed an opportunity to achieve real change and address the barriers to participating in this scheme. The government cannot claim to be giving senior Australians real choices in their retirement without addressing these known barriers. Research by the University of New South Wales has found that, where there is a low awareness or low understanding of financial products such as commercial reverse mortgages and the Pension Loans Scheme, interest in them can be improved by providing information in an easy-to-understand way. Clearly, for the government, there is much more to do here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still older Australians unable to access the program despite owning property. For instance, many Australians live in land-leased communities, including many in my electorate on the New South Wales Central Coast. There are over 500 such communities in New South Wales, accommodating around 34,000 residents. These Australians own their own homes but, because they do not own the land, they are unable to access the scheme. This isn't fair. The government must examine this issue and make further changes to open the scheme for these Australians who could otherwise benefit. Of course these changes do nothing to address the very real living costs and the pressures faced by age pensioners who do not own their own homes, many of them women—the fastest-growing group of homeless in our society today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although these are positive changes which will assist some older Australians, Australia's age pensioners won't be fooled by this government. They know that this government is not on their side. They need only look to the bungled vaccine rollout, the problems with boosters, and RATS not being available to aged-care homes. This government has failed older Australians, especially older Australians living in the outer suburbs or the regions. Many times, they've tried to cut the pension and increase the pension age, including in three budgets when the current Prime Minister had the job of Treasurer. In the 2014 budget, they tried to cut pension indexation, which would have meant that pensioners would be forced to live on $80 a week less within the decade. This unfair cut would have ripped $23 billion from the pockets of Australian pensioners. In that budget, often known as the 'horror budget', they cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions—support designed to help pensioners with the rising cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They also axed the $900 seniors supplement to self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card. As a pharmacist and as someone who worked at the local hospital in Wyong in my community for almost a decade, I know how much that support means to older Australians, especially in terms of being able to afford health care as out-of-pocket costs grow and waitlists lengthen. This government then tried to reset the deeming rate thresholds—a cut that would have seen 500,000 part-pensioners worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, the Liberals did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension to around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension assets test. In the 2016 budget, they tried to cut the pension of around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to limit overseas travel for pensioners to six weeks. They also tried to cut the pension for over 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. The government's own figures show that this would have left over 563,000 Australians who were currently receiving a pension or allowance worse off. Over 10 years, in excess of 1.5 million pensioners would be worse off under this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, this third-term government spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70 and they waited four years before adjusting the deeming rates for age pensioners, despite the Reserve Bank continually reducing its rate over the same period. The Liberals still have cuts to pensions before the parliament. They want to completely take away the pension supplement from pensioners who go overseas for more than six weeks. This could see around $120 million ripped from the pockets of pensioners, many of whom have family ties and family responsibilities outside of Australia which mean absences of longer than six weeks—for example, those caring for a loved one or a family member. The government still wants to make pensioners born overseas wait longer before qualifying for the age pension by increasing the residency requirements from 10 to 15 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Older Australians are worried, and why wouldn't they be? They're worried about the rising cost of living, including out-of-pocket healthcare costs. They're worried about the spiralling cost of living under this coalition government. They're worried that, if they need more assistance to stay in their home, they'll have to wait far too long to get it. They're worried that, if they need residential aged care, it will be substandard because it's underfunded and understaffed. Above all, they are worried that, if this Morrison government is re-elected, they could face another three years during which these problems just continue and grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In time I have left, I want to briefly turn to the subject of aged care. Frail older Australians in our community deserve better. They deserve better than this government. They deserve better than a minister who goes to the cricket for three days rather than presenting to the COVID hearings to be held to account for the deaths of over 600 older Australians who have died in aged care this year of COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was four years yesterday that I lost my dad to younger onset dementia. I know many people in this House and many people across Australia have lost a loved one slowly, piece by piece, as dementia has ravaged them. So many people have spoken to me who, through COVID, haven't been able to speak to or see a loved one. One local person told me that she could only see her mum through a screen on FaceTime and her mum tried to pass her a cup of tea through the screen because she didn't understand that they weren't in the same room. Then there was the great-grandson who was so distressed that he couldn't visit his great-grandma because he wasn't old enough to get a jab and so couldn't see her.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senior Australians deserve better. They deserve a government that cares. There have been countless reports on aged care in Australia, including from the royal commission. An interim report is titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, and the neglect has continued under this government. What I can't forgive is this Prime Minister, who, as Treasurer, made savage cuts to aged care, which have left the system underfunded and older people vulnerable and exposed. I can't forgive the Prime Minister for this and nor will I forgive the aged-care minister for going to the cricket while older Australians died alone, without someone to comfort them, without a kind word. This is not good enough. Older Australians deserve better. No frail, older Australian—someone's father, someone's mother or someone's grandfather—should die alone, lonely and afraid, in aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is any measure of our society, it is the respect and dignity that we show to the most vulnerable in our community. Senior Australians deserve better. Older Australians deserve better. They deserve a change of government. They deserve a government that cares. They deserve a government that acts. They deserve a Labor government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282918" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIU</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021. Through this bill, the Morrison government is increasing the flexibility of the Pension Loans Scheme to give our senior Australians more choices in their retirement. Australians are living more than 10 years longer than they were 50 years ago. I'm sure I speak for all in this place when I say that we want our senior Australians to enjoy the best quality of life during their retirement. One of the key factors in achieving this is financial independence. The Retirement Income Review highlighted that accessing a portion of a pensioner's home equity can greatly improve their living standards in retirement. This is particularly true for those senior Australians who hold a substantive asset but have limited income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many senior Australians, the age pension is a key source of retirement income, but with housing prices increasing significantly in recent years many senior Australians have become paper millionaires with limited ability to access the benefits of their appreciating assets. For example, since 2003, the median house price in Melbourne has grown from around $280,000 to approximately $937,000. This is where the Pension Loans Scheme comes into play, giving senior Australians another option for using their accumulated wealth to support their retirement lifestyle. Participation in the Pension Loans Scheme is voluntary, and the scheme is similar to a reverse mortgage product. Like home equity release products available in the private market, the scheme enables Australians of age pension age to voluntarily unlock the equity in their home. It provides senior Australians with the option of drawing a fortnightly loan amount, backed by the equity in their home or other real estate assets, to supplement their other retirement income. Through this scheme pensioners can top up their pension payment with loan payments up to a maximum of 150 per cent of the fortnightly rate of the age pension. Eligible nonpensioners, such as self-funded retirees, can receive the full 150 per cent of the fortnightly age pension rate in loan payments. This gives senior Australians the option of staying in their own home while boosting their retirement income. Importantly, participants in the scheme have complete discretion as to how they spend their money. In 2019, the Morrison government provided access to this scheme for all Australians of age pension age, including self-funded retirees and maximum rate pensioners. We also increased the amount available as a fortnightly loan. These changes have seen a fivefold increase in take-up over the last two years, and there are currently more than 5,000 participants in the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will introduce two additional features to the Pension Loans Scheme to further increase flexibility and confidence in the scheme for those senior Australians who choose to use it. These measures will come into effect on 1 July 2022. Firstly, the introduction of a no-negative-equity guarantee will give participants confidence they will not repay more than the equity they have in the property used to secure their loan when settling their debt. This change will make the Pension Loans Scheme a more attractive option for senior Australians in their retirement. Secondly, participants in the Pension Loans Scheme will be able to access a portion of their payment as a lump sum advance. Life often throws surprises your way. This change reflects that reality, giving retirees greater flexibility and a new mechanism to help them meet unexpected or substantial expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Homeownership has been seen as the bedrock of our society. For many Australians, a place to call your own is a crucial part of what has been called the Australian dream. This bill is all about giving our senior Australians more choice and control of their retirement lifestyle. We want to give all Australians the confidence to tap into a small portion of their home equity to increase their retirement outcomes. It is estimated that around 80 per cent of senior Australians over the age of 65 are homeowners. The changes introduced with this bill will give those Australians more freedom to enjoy their retirement. It will help them to stay in their own homes throughout their golden years where they can continue to create cherished memories with friends and family. We want our senior Australians to enjoy greater choice, financial independence and quality of life in their retirement years, and so I gladly commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021. The Pension Loans Scheme, or PLS, now renamed by the government as the Home Equity Access Scheme, is meant to allow older people who are asset rich but cash poor to access an income. The intention was to enhance the living standards of our senior Australians who are unable to access the age pension because they did not meet the income test. Why, then, are the take-up rates so low? That is the question we should all be asking. Clearly there are a number of barriers that are preventing Australians from accessing the program, and these include things like equity of access, complexity of financial products, unintended consequences of safeguards against excessive debt, higher-than-average interest rates and cultural issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, these very same concerns have been raised with me in the electorate office recently. I was contacted by a constituent, Peter. He and his wife are both retired and on a pension with a small, self-managed superannuation fund. They explained that, like many Australians, they receive a fortnightly part age pension and a drawdown from their self-managed super fund for the rest of their needs. The couple own their own home, which, like for so many other properties, has increased in value over the years. They inquired about the possibility of supplementing their pension income through the PLS but found the process to be difficult, overly complicated and contradictory. Again, they appear not to be alone in this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with Peter to listen to his experiences and his wife's experiences, and I was shocked to hear about the conflicting advice they received from Centrelink regarding the implications of joining the scheme. My constituent explained that when a pensioner has a PLS in excess or uses funds for a purchase the asset results in a decrease in pension. The government allows the pensioner to draw down on the difference of up to 150 per cent via the PLS and then charges 4.5 per cent interest on the amount, which compounds over the years. Peter sought clarification from Centrelink about how the PLS would affect his personal pension under the current asset test but received very unclear and contradictory advice. That's just one example of the advice that's being given to people who are seeking the PLS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following our meeting in December, I took it upon myself to write to the minister responsible to seek clarifications for my constituents about how the scheme affects the pension and asset testing and particularly about Peter's situation. The minister's response highlights that, indeed, the proceeds from the loan or any asset purchased with the loan would have an impact on the pension. But there is clearly a lack of clarity and transparency in the PLS which is dissuading people from using it. And changing the name to the Home Equity Access Scheme does very little to clear things up—it's just a name change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that the 2018-19 budget included some modest changes, including expanding eligibility to full-rate pensioners and self-funded retirees, increasing the maximum fortnightly payment rate under the PLS from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of the full pension and importantly reducing the interest rate from 5.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent—a very modest reduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We supported these changes because, after all, they meant that more senior Australians, including full-time pensioners, could perhaps increase their income, and I welcome the fact that this bill expands the scheme even further. It introduces more financial safeguards and greater payment flexibility, allowing two advance annual lump sum payments to help participants with larger expenses. It's a testament to the people who have been vocal advocates in this area that the government finally gave in and reduced the interest rate again to 3.5 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side have long fought for this measure to bring greater equity to the system, but the changes have come too late for too many. Interest rates in Australia have never been lower, yet participants in this particular scheme, the PLS, have been paying a higher interest rate than almost every mortgagor in the country. This is a similar problem to that of deeming rates, which are set much higher than standard interest rates and ultimately penalise pensioners. What kind of government makes money from pensioners? This is what's happening in this case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we believe that this scheme, which allows people to unlock their housing access to improve their retirement incomes, should be fair, easy and understandable for all senior Australians to access. Unfortunately, this government has again missed an opportunity to introduce real changes that affect the lives of pensioners for their betterment. There are still older Australians unable to access the program despite owning real property. For instance, many tens of thousands of Australians live in land lease communities. These Australians own their own homes but, because they do not own the land, they're unable to access the scheme. This is extremely unfair. The government must look at this issue, make further changes and open the scheme for these Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PLS needs to be fair, transparent and easily accessible. The government can and should do better by people like my constituent Peter and all other pensioners trying to live their retirement years in dignity. We are supporting this bill, but at the same time we want to ensure that all pensioners are supported to live in dignity. They deserve nothing less, and unfortunately this government has a very bad track record when it comes to supporting pensioners. We've become used to seeing this government try to chip away at people's age pensions, and that has been the record of this Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners have worked very hard to receive in the course of their working lives a small pension to live in dignity. The age pension is a proud Labor legacy. It was introduced by Alfred Deakin's government under pressure from Labor to ensure that older Australians could live with dignity. Pensioners, as I've said many times in this place, have worked hard all their lives. They've contributed to our economy and our society by paying taxes, and they've built the foundations that we walk on today. They deserve respect and dignity, and they deserve a government that is on their side. Only Labor will fight for pensioners. When Labor was last in government, we increased the pension—a real increase, not CPI or cost of living and other things. It was a real increase of $30 per week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past seven years, this government has had a record on cutting pensions or trying to cut the pension time and time again. It seems like a national sport for the Liberals and Nationals to attempt to cut the pension in every budget, every year. For example, in 2014, they tried to cut pension indexation, a cut that would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 a week less within 10 years. In the same year, they cut $1 billion from pensioners' concessions. Then they axed the $900 seniors supplement to self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card. In 2015, they did a deal with the Greens to cut pensions for around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension asset test. In 2016, they tried to cut the pension to around 190,000 other pensioners as part of a plan to limit overseas travel for pensioners to six weeks. That same year, they tried to cut the pension for over 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. The government's own figures showed this would have left over 563,000 Australians who were receiving a pension or allowance worse off than they were. And who can forget that they have spent years trying to increase the pension age to 70?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently, in August last year the government was caught out by Labor on its pension freeze for 2.5 million pensions. This side of the House fought very hard to stop this cruel pension freeze. The Morrison government still has cuts to the pension before this parliament. For example, it wants to completely take away the pension supplement from pensioners who go overseas for more than six weeks. This would see around $120 million ripped from the pockets of pensioners. As I have said in this place many times, pensioners who have worked all their lives and paid their taxes have a right to live wherever they want to in retirement—whether it be overseas, whether it be moving from South Australia to Queensland, whether it be moving from Victoria to Western Australia or whether it be moving from Australia back to their ancestral home in Europe or somewhere else around the world. They have every right to do so. They've worked all their lives. They've paid their taxes. They have the right to retire in dignity and live where they want to. Yet this government still wants to make pensioners born overseas wait longer before qualifying for the age pension by increasing the residency requirement from 10 to 15 years. All this is occurring while the cost of living continues to rise, including spiralling out-of-pocket healthcare costs because of the Medicare freeze put in place by this coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cutting the pension really is in this government's DNA. Pensioners won't forget this government's record on cutting the pension. Pensioners have worked their entire lives. Pensioners deserve dignity. They deserve to live out their last years in serenity, quiet and peace, not constantly juggling paperwork and trying to see how they can earn much-deserved retirement pension dollars in their old age.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  It's always a pleasure to follow the member for Adelaide. I always appreciate his contributions. I just want to get him to reflect on a comment he made in his contribution around people living in properties where they own the house but lease the land. Many of those people who live in that situation, who receive the age pension, also potentially receive some form of rent assistance. If you change that system it might affect their ability to receive rent assistance, and that might be a greater detriment to their income than amendments to the Pension Loans Scheme. As with any of these things, whilst I understand the point the member for Adelaide was trying to make, we should always be cognisant of the potential flow-on effects by considering the full picture, not just a particular issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time prior to this place, as many would know, I spent a long time in banking and financial services. Frequently I spoke to clients about reverse mortgages; it was always a point of discussion because they were looking to find ways to access the equity in their home. Despite the fact that the Pension Loans Scheme, in its various forms, has been around since approximately 1985, there have been a variety of changes to the scheme over the years to try and make it more attractive and open it up to more people. In that time from 1985 to now, we're in a situation where only about 5,000 or so people access the Pension Loans Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021, is important for a number of reasons. Importantly it's about improving the flexibility of the Pension Loans Scheme and giving the opportunity for more senior Australians to have options on drawing on the equity in their home or on other real estate assets to improve their living standards in retirement. As the member for Adelaide and others in this debate have quite rightly pointed out, we have the privilege of being in this place. But we have this privilege because of the people who have gone before us. We should recognise the efforts of those people who have worked hard all their lives—they've saved and they've contributed to building our nation as it is today—and always work towards ensuring they have adequate incomes in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are those, we recognise, who have had the opportunity to have very significant and adequate resources for retirement. Many of those people lived and worked in an age, particularly if they worked for large corporates or if they worked for the public sector, when they received defined benefit pensions. Those on defined benefit pensions, particularly larger ones, don't face the difficulties of the risk of the variability of superannuation returns that many newer retirees face. Many others had various forms of fixed or annuitised pension income, which gives them a level of certainty on the income that they receive each and every month or over the course of a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as we know, one of the great risks with retirement income is that your income stream—whether it be from an allocated pension, the dividends from a share portfolio, rental income from an investment property, or income from other pension sources—generally, in most cases, is sufficient to cover your day-to-day living expenses, but, if you're going to live for 20 or 30 years after retirement, you're going to have some other major expenses. You might need to purchase a new car. You might need to upgrade your appliances at home. You might need to do some renovations. Sadly, your health might deteriorate, and you might need to do some renovations to improve safety measures around, or access to, your house. Not having something like a pension loans scheme, where you can access a capital amount to do these things, will impact on the pool of investments you have with which to generate an income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have long talked about the adequacy of retirement incomes in Australia. Whilst I think this is a good step in helping and improving that flexibility, I think much more work needs to be done on the entire retirement income ecosystem to ensure that it's fit for purpose in the 21st century, and I would hope that the next parliament takes up that opportunity to do some more work in that space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I look at this new bill, one of the important features—which is lacking in some of the products that are available out in the marketplace, although I do note, since 2012, this issue has largely been taken care of in those products as well—is the introduction of a no-negative-equity guarantee to all scheme participants from 1 July 2022. The guarantee will mean that, when scheme participants settle their debt, they will not repay more than the equity in the property used to secure their loan. This measure is designed purely to enhance the safeguards currently in place and ensure that the conservative age based loan-to-valuation ratios minimise the possibility of a participant's debt exceeding the equity in their secured property. I think that's critically important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons those changes were made in 2012 by those opposite when they were last in government is that, during the 2000s when reverse mortgages were a very popular product out in the marketplace, we saw that, when things went bad with the GFC, people were left in a position of negative equity position in their homes. Equally, even in the ordinary course of events, they could have been left with a negative equity position because of the effect of compounding interest on the debt that was initially taken out. That means that, if you exceed the equity in the house and you have that negative debt, that money has to come out of other assets. So this is a very important and key provision of this bill that brings it into line with what's been done more generally in the marketplace since 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, from 1 July 2022, participants in the scheme will be able to access up to two capped payments in any 26-fortnight period. Participants of the scheme will be able to access a portion of their payment as a lump sum. This will give retirees a new mechanism and greater flexibility to meet unexpected costs and substantial expenses, as I outlined earlier. The maximum lump sum advance is capped at 50 per cent of the maximum fortnightly rate of the age pension over the following 12 months. Based on current age pension rates, the maximum advance payment could be around $12,580 for singles and around $18,960 for couples combined. The participants will be able to take up to two advances in any 26-fortnight period, with the combined total limited to a 50 per cent cap. Any advance taken will reduce the amount of the fortnightly Pension Loans Scheme payment received by the participant, and the amount the participant will receive will generally be the same regardless of whether they take an advance payment, fortnightly payments or a combination of both. So the value of that flexibility is they can adjust what they wish to do to best meet their circumstances, and that's what the objective of this bill is—that people can make their own informed decisions based on their own individual circumstances. Importantly, this will also protect participants from building excessive debt balances while providing them flexibility on how they can draw down on their equity and their assets for self-support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are these changes necessary? Well, as we've seen over the past many years, Australians are now living up to 10 years longer than they were 50 years ago. As I said earlier, we want to see our senior Australians enjoying the best quality of life during their retirement. The key factor to achieving this, above all else, is financial security and independence. For many senior Australians the age pension is a key source of retirement income, but with housing prices increasing significantly over recent years we've also seen many senior Australians become asset rich and cash-flow poor. These changes open up the flexibility and the opportunity for many Australians to access that asset and create a cash flow for themselves that is going to improve their cash flows and their quality of life. That's what the Pension Loans Scheme is designed to do—and that is, in fairness, really what it has been designed to do since its introduction in 1985.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there are many other of these types of products in the private marketplace, but their interest rates are higher and their fees and charges are higher, so there is an attractive proposition in what the government is offering to Australian pensioners. Importantly, people have the opportunity to make their own decisions, and we would always encourage people to get sound financial advice to assess their situation and the suitability of this or any other type of product. The changes introduced with this bill will give older Australians more freedom to enjoy their retirement, and that's what we want to see. As I've seen regularly across my electorate in talking to those who are now retired, whilst previously they wanted to go on trips overseas—and many have even recently said to me they want to go back to cruising, because that's one of their great joys: to have a cruise maybe several times a year—equally many are buying caravans and travelling around Australia, enjoying our great continent. These changes provide the opportunity for them to have the cash flow and the access to equity in their home to do those things. But, importantly, it allows them to stay in their home. It doesn't involve them selling down their home to access that equity to do those things, unless they so decide to do that from a lifestyle perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that homeownership in Australia has been a bedrock of our society. It is your home. It's more than a place simply to live. It's a place where you've spent many, many years enjoying being surrounded by your family and your friends in your community. It is critically important, therefore, that we support our senior Australians in their retirement to enjoy it to the extent that they wish. I believe that giving them flexibility through our Pension Loans Scheme to stay in their own home and access that equity for the benefit of their retirement, to spend as they wish and to tap into, if they require, for emergency expenses is just another example of this government continuing to deliver for all Australians right across the country. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <a href="281988" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBAIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise today with a smile on my face, not because it's Valentine's Day, but because the Black Summer Bushfire Recovery Grants Program has finally been announced, and there are some hugely worthwhile projects in Eden-Monaro that are being funded. It has been a long and difficult road to get to this point for so many of my communities, and I am glad that the government has listened to the calls to do more. I cannot count how many times I've stood up in the parliament and begged the government to do more since I was elected in 2020. I have asked politely, I have pleaded at times and I have even gotten mad, because it seemed like the government didn't listen or didn't care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak to people almost every day who are still going through trauma and have got a long way to go before they get back in a home. People in regional communities like mine are strong and stoic, and usually they don't want or need government assistance, but these past two years have been incredibly hard and, two years on, this funding is needed just as much now as it was immediately after the fires. The funding is so very, very welcome, but I do question that we are now two years on, and the timing of the announcement is a little bit unusual. It's starting to feel like a bit of a coincidence that we are on the eve of an election. But the funding has been announced, even if overdue. Community groups and not-for-profit organisations have worked incredibly hard to meet the grant applications deadline. They were promised they would hear back in December last year, but bushfire recovery has turned into an election sweetener. But I'm stoked because I can now get in contact with community groups and congratulate them on receiving these grant funds, and I can't wait to catch up with them to see how their projects are progressing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been fighting for years to get this funding over the line, and now I can turn my mind past the announcement and to the delivery, because we need to see the money delivered to these projects quickly and seamlessly. I have already spoken to some community groups, and the relief and happiness from individuals and groups is truly heartwarming. I want to make sure they are not forced to jump through any more hoops. The announcement has been made, funding has been promised and our communities are celebrating, so it is time to get a move on and make sure this money flows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While many people across Eden-Monaro are no doubt feeling optimistic and hopeful thanks to this announcement, my heart still goes out to those struggling, to those members of my community who have been living in caravans or temporary accommodation for two years. I have no doubt they will be glad this money is coming to our community, but I also know that the funding won't help them directly. There are still so many people that need assistance, and some may be too proud to ask for help. Please know you are not forgotten, and we will continue to fight to make sure that you get the assistance and support that you need as we head into our recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years now, members of the Queanbeyan community have been working really hard, raising money and building awareness about the need for a purpose-built respite care facility in Queanbeyan—somewhere that will support carers and provide short-term residential care for people aged between 18 and 59 suffering from a terminal or chronic illness. Respite Care for QBN is a project that was inspired by the tragic experience of Yvonne and Joe Cuschieri's son, Steven, who died at 53 while in an aged-care home, receiving respite care. At the time, it was the only option for Steven, who was being cared for by his parents after being diagnosed with brain cancer. Since then, the fight for a respite centre has been powered by a desire for no other family to have the same experience. One of the recommendations from the royal commission into aged care was to get younger people out of aged care. This facility not only is much needed and wanted by the Queanbeyan community but was highlighted as an issue by that royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Plans for the respite centre are continuing to progress, and the next piece of the puzzle is to secure ongoing funding. I remain committed to working with all levels of government to find a suitable ongoing funding arrangement, but in the meantime I'm looking forward to attending the Respite Care for QBN 1920s ball and men's calendar launch this Saturday evening. Organisers have done an incredible job of pulling this event together and, after three COVID related cancellations, I am sure they are feeling relieved that this day is coming. It promises to be a fun-filled community event, raising money for an incredibly important local cause. I can't think of a better way to spend Saturday evening, and I look forward to seeing you all there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">s McINTOSH</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  In Western Sydney, we are creating more local jobs for local people and the infrastructure to unlock even more opportunities. I am at the table, backing and fighting for more local jobs for Western Sydney to be at the heart of a new era of manufacturing and to educate and train our kids at world-class institutions in the jobs of the future. People in Lindsay want to work where they live. As someone who did the commute each day for over 10 years, I know how important this is. That is why creating local jobs for local people is at the centre of my plan for Lindsay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 82,000 people in Lindsay have benefited because of the Morrison government's tax plan, and the benefits from creating tax relief for our local people are so important when we are talking about creating local jobs. Over 76,000 taxpayers are benefiting directly from our tax cuts, and over 15,000 businesses in Lindsay are able to access the instant asset write-off. When I go out to local businesses, this is one of our measures that I hear about most, whether it is a manufacturer creating Australian-made doors and windows or a manufacturer creating Aussie-made Penrith trucks. A great example of this was when I took the Treasurer to visit Scott and his team at JK Williams, a local earth-moving business. We saw how much their business benefited from the instant asset write-off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also creating wage subsidies for apprentices, backing over 2,000 apprentices in Lindsay. We are extending the support to ensure they can finish their training. It is so wonderful when I walk onto the floor of a manufacturing business, onto the floor of a factory, and see young women taking up trades and being supported in doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID pandemic has hit businesses in my electorate of Lindsay hard, like it has across Australia, and for many it has been the biggest challenge they have ever faced. But JobKeeper has supported almost 6,000 businesses and 26,500 employees in my electorate of Lindsay. The tax-free cash flow boost has helped around 5,200 small and medium businesses, providing $229 billion in payments to help businesses in Lindsay stay afloat during the pandemic. Around 6,500 local businesses will be able to use the extended loss carryback measure to support cash flow and confidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With unemployment at 4.2 per cent, the Morrison government has made an unprecedented investment in skilling and training Australians, and we have the highest number of trade apprentices—220,000—since records were first kept in 1963. There are now more Australians in jobs than there were pre COVID. This is so important to my community of Lindsay, which is growing in opportunities and growing in investment. A lot of this has to do with our investment in Western Sydney international airport, a nation-building project right in the heart of Western Sydney, with 28,000 direct and indirect jobs by 2031, five years after the airport's opening, which is really just around the corner, in 2026. It's a $5.3 billion investment from the Morrison government, connecting Western Sydney to the world. Over half of the workforce during construction, which I'm really proud of, has been local people. So that is exceeding the original target of 30 per cent. We have a local workforce of over 50 per cent. That truly is local jobs for local people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something I am really passionate about is the future of our young people and educating and training our kids in the jobs of the future. When there's a once-in-a-generation opportunity like the Western Sydney airport, and with universities coming on board and the CSIRO moving into the local area, we have to grasp hold of these opportunities for our young kids so that they can work where they live and not move out of the area to find a good job. That's what I'm passionate about, that's what I'm driving, and that's all part of my plan for Lindsay.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year shone a light on some of the core institutional barriers to the advancement of women in Australian society. We saw a cultural reckoning in this very building, the exposure of a toxic workplace environment which too often has ignored the appalling treatment of women. This led to an outpouring from women around the country who related to this and said enough is enough. We saw our 2021 Australian of the Year, Grace Tame, shine a light on the sexual abuse of Australian children and the rights of victims-survivors to talk about their experiences. Last week, we saw Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins speak so eloquently and with such power at the Press Club, confirming their status as two of the most courageous inspirational Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge some of the strong and inspiring women from my electorate who have bravely shared their stories of such experiences with me, including how often they have been let down by the very system that should be there to support and protect them. None of these women wanted to be in a position to be talking about these things. But their work and the work of countless others is changing the conversation around gender based violence around in this country, and it's something for which all Australians should be grateful. If we look at the facts, women still face many barriers, and that needs to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot of talk from the Morrison government about women but we have not seen a lot of action to address the inequalities faced by Australian women. To address these issues, we need a government that cares about inequality and how to address it, not just how a photo opportunity could help address an immediate political problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud that Labor is, and always has been, committed to equality for women and is committed to a suite of policies to address the many facets of gender inequality in this country. First and foremost, we need to ensure that women are safe, both in the home and in the workplace. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report found that two in five women have experienced sexual harassment at work in the last five years. That's why Labor will legislate to make it clear that employers have a positive duty to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. In the home, we know that one in six women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or former partner and that one woman is killed on average every week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, women fleeing violence are being turned away from accommodation and services because of insufficient funding towards sector workers and the failure to recognise this tragedy as a national priority. A Labor government would fund 500 new community sector workers, with half of these in rural and regional areas. These workers would include caseworkers to help women leave violent relationships, financial counsellors for women in financially abusive relationships, and support workers for children. We would also appoint a new family, domestic and sexual violence commissioner to act as an advocate for victims-survivors, coordinate national safety policies, provide reports that track progress against the national plan, and work with states and territories to gather data.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing is also crucially important for women's security. A Labor government will create a $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund to build 20,000 social housing properties—4,000 of the 20,000 social housing properties will be allocated to women and children fleeing domestic and family violence and to older women on low incomes who are at risk of homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a continuing gender pay gap in Australia where we face a 20 per cent gap in total wages and women retire with 40 per cent less super than men on average. I am proud that Labor is going to legislate to close the gender wage gap with a range of policies, including empowering the Fair Work Commission to have more power to look at wage increases for female-dominated industries, including some of those that have been at the coalface throughout the pandemic. That includes aged care, early childhood care and education—female dominated industries that have really helped to get us through this. It is time they received the pay and respect they deserve in that way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just one policy that is needed to address these things; it is looking at the issue of gender equality across the board. Our childcare policy is another really key element that will make that conversation more equal as families discuss who goes back to work with— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I was at Peak Hill on 15 January 2018, when the first lot of Australian steel from Whyalla was dropped off to begin the momentous Inland Rail project. The first leg, from Parkes to Narromine, is completed. That benefited more than 100 small businesses tapping into $110 million of procurement. Inland Rail continues to create jobs and spark local economies, with concrete sleepers for the nation-building infrastructure project being made in Wagga Wagga, my home town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Deputy Prime Minister a month after the Inland Rail project started, I was pleased to start the process by getting the intergovernmental agreements with the states signed up—firstly with Jacinta Allan in Victoria, then with John Barilaro in New South Wales and finally with Mark Bailey in your home state of Queensland, Mr Speaker. But last Friday was a red-letter day for Wagga Wagga and indeed the project when the Australian Rail Track Corporation signing contracts worth $143 million with Austrak was announced and declared. I was able to go out and have a look at the factory at Bomen, nearby the special activation precinct at the Riverina intermodal and freight logistics hub—very much Inland Rail central. This is supporting 36 jobs that would otherwise not be continuing at that Austrak Wagga Wagga facility, as well as 14 jobs for Austrak's Rockhampton plant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1.3 million sleepers, almost a million of which will be made in my home town, under the new contract will be used to upgrade existing track and complete new sections of rail from Albury through to the Inland Rail end point in Queensland. I visited the facility on Friday and there I met production supervisor Lara Foster, a very impressive supervisor and person who is making sure the staff are doing what they need to do. She's originally from Griffith. She worked with the goldmining operations at Lake Cowal near West Wyalong. She is part and parcel of that vital component getting the job done at Wagga Wagga. Austrak managing director Murray Adams was there, as well as ARTC Inland Rail manager for stakeholder engagement New South Wales (South) Heath Martin. We made this significant announcement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Austrak on its continuing role in Inland Rail. It is creating many jobs—not just the 36 at the concrete plant, but many others in small businesses tapping into this process. It's proof-positive that this 1,700-kilometre corridor of commerce is generating so much excitement in regional Australia—and for good reason. The cement comes from Berrima, the fly-ash comes from Mount Piper, the wire steel for the 280-kilogram sleepers comes from Newcastle and, as I mentioned before, the steel for the actual rail comes from Whyalla. But there are so many businesses tapping into this whole process. Lara Foster said she's been working at the facility for the past five years, and she was pretty energised by this announcement. She said this contract is one of the largest she has seen, and she's excited it will keep 36 families in jobs in Wagga Wagga.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has already invested up to $14.5 billion in Inland Rail. It is making such a difference. The 1.3 million sleepers will include 695,000 standard gauge sleepers for projects in New South Wales and 615,000 dual gauge sleepers for projects in Queensland. And the scope of supply includes the design, manufacture, testing, storage and loading of the sleepers. As we spoke at a press conference, there were 65,000 sleepers stacked up behind us for that presser. It was an impressive sight. It goes to show what can be done when governments invest in the regions. It goes to show what can be done when governments such as ours invest in nation-building infrastructure—and right across this country we're doing just that. The $110 billion of infrastructure is supporting 100,000 workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inland Rail is more than just building a rail line; it's investing in our regions and completing the national freight rail network. Parkes in my electorate is on the east-west-north-south intersector. That's making massive advances too, with small business and just with the community involvement. When I talk about community, it's not just about moving freight on rail. It's about getting trucks off the roads. It's about people. It's about investment. It's about the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Over recent weeks, far-Right antivax protests have cropped up in Canada, Britain, France and New Zealand. Last week these protests came to Canberra, where our 99 per cent adult vaccination rate makes us the most vaccinated city in the world. These protesters have a right to peacefully protest, but those of us who believe in science also have a right to point out that vaccines save lives and conspiracy theories can kill. Since the Morrison government belatedly began rolling out COVID vaccines in Australia, these free vaccines have protected thousands of Australians from hospitalisation and death. They work. Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and vitamin C do not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These protesters aren't just wrong about the science; they're also a risk to democracy. As Van Badham has pointed out, these groups should be judged not by their relatively small numbers but by the damage they're willing to do. Ironically, the people who claim to be saving democracy are the biggest threat to it. The violent antilockdown protests in Melbourne, the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January last year and the global so-called freedom protests have brought together a dangerous brew of conspiracy theories. Today, 15 per cent of Americans agree with the central false tenet of QAnon: that the government and other entities are controlled by Satan-worshipping paedophiles running a child sex trafficking ring. The Melbourne antilockdown protesters have waved swastikas and nooses and welcomed anti-Semites. Some of the Canberra protesters waved Ustase fascist flags and Confederate flags. One brought a loaded sawn-off shotgun into the Parliamentary Triangle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Canberra protests attracted support from Senators Hanson, Antic and Rennick. Like Greens Senator Thorpe, with her support for those who vandalised the Museum of Australian Democracy, these extreme senators seem not to realise they're playing with fire. Over the weekend, the Prime Minister and the Labor leader were each asked about their attitudes to the protest. The Prime Minister said he understood their concerns and blamed state and territory governments. It reminded me of Donald Trump's remark after Charlottesville that there were 'very fine people on both sides'. By contrast, the Labor leader noted that vaccines save lives and called on the protesters to show some respect for health workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The protesters didn't seem to care who they were hurting. When the vandalism of fences at Exhibition Park forced the closure of the Lifeline Bookfair, they shut down a charity event that helps people with mental health challenges. Lifeline's amazing volunteers had been working for months to prepare for the book fair. I have made a donation to help compensate, and I'd encourage other Canberrans to do so too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge the many Canberrans who turned the other cheek over the weekend, putting up with abuse in the streets and in shops. There are countless stories of nasty behaviour, but I'd particularly single out Richard Watkins and his staff at BentSpoke in Braddon, who behaved with calm decency when a protester threw a glass at the bar. I'd also commend the professionalism of the Australian Federal Police in managing these protests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there was the attempt by protesters to co-opt the Eureka legend. In one sense, there's nothing new in this. Barely had the shooting stopped in 1854 when the battle of the Eureka Stockade became the battle for the Eureka Stockade—a battle for its history, meaning and legacy. As Geoffrey Blainey once put it, Eureka is a 'great neon sign with messages that flick on and off, with different messages for different people on different occasions'. But the Eureka legend is too big to be co-opted by extremists. Mark Twain called it the 'finest thing in Australian history'. Ben Chifley believed Eureka was 'the first real affirmation of our determination to become masters of our own political destiny'. HV 'Doc' Evatt said, 'Australian democracy was born at Eureka.' Gough Whitlam thought that it would 'stir the imagination of the Australian people'. Even Robert Menzies and John Howard acknowledged the role that Eureka played in our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, Eureka was a tax revolt, but it was also about democracy, multiculturalism, egalitarianism, mateship and the fair go. Eureka inspired the women's suffrage movement and the republican movement. It is fitting that our first female Prime Minister was the member for Lalor. As Clare Wright, Peter FitzSimons, David Headon, John Uhr, John Molony and others have made clear, Eureka is a big national story—a story for everyone, not just the extremists.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that it is not easy for us to continue to carve out money. Indeed, the Sunshine Coast today is the recipient of more federal funding for infrastructure than it ever has been in its history. Some could argue, therefore, that that's enough; let it be. But I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that there's a reason the member for Fisher and I continue to prosecute the case for more funding, and that is population growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no project of greater importance to our future as a region than heavy passenger rail. With the explosion in population, rail will be important not just to ensure connectivity but also to ensure population settlement. Indeed, the trick for us is to avoid urban sprawl and a strip of high-rises along the coast and to allow for density around new railway stations and greater density in old railway towns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, for the first time in history, this government, the coalition government, has put money on the table—$390 million no less—for the north coast rail line between Beerburrum and Nambour. Not so much as one dollar had ever been put to that stretch of rail, but we went into bat for it and we secured that record funding. Unfortunately, the state government, who owns and operates that rail system, still to this day refuses outright to match our funding. It is a free gift. It is a 50 per cent discount on their cost. We ask for no equity play, but still they refuse to match our funding. Nevertheless, our priority remains delivering for the community, and that money shall be used thus, and we want it to be used. But it will only be used on stage 1 of a two-stage project, between Beerburrum and Nambour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes me to our priorities for rail moving forward. There are two. First, we need to ensure that stage 2 of the project, Landsborough to Nambour, is improved. If indeed the state government is wanting to hold back on getting the job done, as they are, let's go for the solution that the community deserves. That solution is full duplication all the way through to the Nambour station, designed in such a way that it can accommodate the possibility of fast rail in the future. That's what stage 2 should look like. Our second priority is to have heavy passenger rail running from Beerwah all the way through to the Maroochydore CBD, passing through Caloundra and Kawana, opening up that coastal strip to heavy passenger rail for the first time. We're serious about this, which is why we have put $5 million on the table for a business case for stage 2 through to Nambour and $3 million on the table for investment planning for the CAMCOS corridor. The state, thankfully, will match us on the CAMCOS investment study, but it still refuses to match us on Nambour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I will just say that these two rail projects, which our region needs, will be the most transformative projects. The fact that we will be hosting the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games puts a deadline into the system and builds pressure into the system. We need to ensure these projects are delivered on time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  We are in the midst of a GP crisis in regional parts of Australia, particularly in my electorate of Bendigo. It has not been this bad since the Liberal and National parties were last in government in 2004, when people would say that the books were closed. People are saying that all over again. I regularly get complaints from people who have lived in the area for a long time and their GP is just booked out and from people who have moved into the area and can't find a GP that will add them, so to speak, to the books. They're told that the books are closed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This crisis is of the government's own making. They really have stuffed up primary health care delivery in this country. The freeze to the Medicare rebate has made it hard for some GPs to break even, forcing some GPs to charge gap fees for people wanting basic consult services. It means that some people delay going to the GP for a regular check-up because of the cost involved. They don't go to the GP until their symptoms or condition is much worse. They then present to the GP with quite chronic health issues. With the Medicare freeze the government has made it harder for GPs. It's simply a lot more expensive for GPs to run their practices today, and Medicare is not keeping up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also hasn't trained enough doctors locally and hasn't put the right incentives in place for doctors to move to the regions. What the government has done in the last little while is too little too late. People are saying to me locally that they don't believe it will work. We have a real problem attracting people to the regions. In my area of Bendigo I am told that locally we are about to have seven GPs retire and a few more move away. That's going to have a huge impact on the ability of GPs to meet demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now if somebody is wanting a consult in any of the big clinics they almost have to plan to get sick three weeks ahead. It's at least a three-week wait for some people to see a doctor. Kids don't tell you three weeks in advance that they're about to get sick. It's okay if you're going back to a GP, say, to get a script renewed, for a regular check-up or for a consult to manage a chronic health issue. But that's not the majority of cases. The majority of people seek primary health care, seek an appointment with their GP, because they're sick. At the moment the system is so under pressure they're having to wait three weeks. In the middle of a pandemic people can't access the basics of primary health care. As we come out of this pandemic we need to be investing more—more in Medicare, more in primary health care and more in encouraging GPs to move to the regions and to stay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  On the weekend I had the opportunity to join Premier Steven Marshall to inspect the finished Magill and Portrush roads intersection project. It was a $98 million partnership between the South Australian and Australian governments. I was very proud to be there at the end, because of course I was there at the very start. I remember back in 2019 when we made the commitment to invest together in that project—$98 million, fifty-fifty—to upgrade and overhaul that intersection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Portrush Road is Highway 1, so it's a Commonwealth freight route, and Magill Road essentially bisects my electorate, so it's right in the heart and of course has an enormous amount of traffic. Some 65,000 cars a day go through that intersection. It needed an overhaul. We have delivered on that. We have extra turning lanes off Portrush Road onto Magill Road in both directions, as well as enhanced left-turn lanes in all directions, particularly from Magill Road to Portrush Road if you're travelling east.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took almost three years from conception to finished product. The Premier and I visited there on Sunday. We saw the new asphalt being laid. That will cause some local disruption. I do apologise to residents for the inconvenience of the last couple of years, particularly the last few weeks of night works. It is always a significant hindrance to people when a major highway like Portrush Road has to have restricted lane use. But I'm very confident that people are happy that the imposition was worthwhile and that the outcome we're getting is going to deliver for local families and businesses. What it means, ultimately, is that people will be able to get home quicker and safer. Obviously, having large trucks move through that intersection and carrying a lot of commuter traffic locally, both roads are major arterial roads. Magill Road carries people from our suburbs into and out of the city, and Portrush Road takes people from the tollgate and takes freight moving through the city, which goes from the tollgate, right along Portrush Road and up into the northern industrial parts of northern Adelaide and South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great outcome. It reminds us of how important it is to keep investing in congestion busting in our suburbs. This is one of three projects happening in my electorate, along with the Fullarton Road and Cross Road project and the Glen Osmond Road and Fullarton Road project. All three are excellent examples of us investing in congestion busting for our suburbs. And there's also the productivity outcome of making sure that we are moving goods to market as quickly as possible as well as getting families to and from where they need to go as quickly as possible. I'm proud to see it delivered. I'm proud that, after we committed to it before the last election, coming into the next election we can say that it is done. It's another great example of two governments working together to deliver for the eastern suburbs of Adelaide. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  The end of 2021 was supposed to herald the start of the 'hot vax summer' for my electorate of Lilley. Queenslanders had smashed our 80 per cent vaccination target with a week to spare, restrictions had been lifted and we were ready to celebrate. We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that the omicron surge delivered a fresh set of challenges, and the hot vax summer has been postponed for another 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we prepared to enter our third year of this pandemic, there was a sense amongst my community that northsiders needed a bit of a morale booster to get through the omicron surge and kick off a fresh year. So I fired up Lilley's trusty Ute Full of Tim Tams and got to work. I asked my constituents to nominate someone they knew who deserved to be recognised for their work or for their good deeds during the omicron surge. And seeing as today is Valentine's Day, I wanted to wish everyone in the chamber a happy Valentine's and spread the love by recognising a few of the very deserving Lilley nominees of the Ute Full of Tim Tams here in the federal parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the first stop for Lilley's Ute Full of Tim Tams was to our Lilley healthcare workers at the Prince Charles Hospital, who were nominated by Lily, as it was. Our nurses, our doctors, our wardies, our cleaners and our admin staff at the Prince Charles Hospital do brilliant work even at normal times, but they have worked around the clock, for two years straight now, testing northsiders at the fever clinic and treating positive patients in our pop-up COVID ward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sandra, who is a local nurse living in Boondall, was nominated by her husband, Kevin. Sandra works at a hospital in Brisbane and regularly puts up her hand to work extra shifts or to stay back to help out with the constant COVID staff shortages. They were a very nice couple to meet, too. Martin nominated his partner, Stephanie, who is molecular scientist at a local pathology lab. Stephanie has been working day and night to tackle the flood of PCR tests at her lab, even working until after midnight on Christmas. Stephanie was not even there when we went to drop off the Tim Tams—she was at work—but I was very glad to meet Martin and their dog instead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">James nominated Joy, from FriendlyCare Pharmacy, which is just across the road from my electorate office, in Nundah. Joy put together a survival kit for James when he was struck down with COVID and organised a contactless delivery for him. Marie nominated Kevin for his voluntary work at the pop-up clinic at Doomben Racecourse. Without volunteers like Kevin putting up their hands to help out we would not be at 90 per cent vaccination rates in Queensland, as we are now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sandra, Stephanie, Joy and Kevin are just a handful of the people who have received a packet of Tim Tams from me this summer and a handful of the healthcare workers who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to help us get through the omicron surge. I thank them and everybody who has helped out for all of their work this summer. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I want to acknowledge the 15 Order of Australia recipients from the electorate of Berowra. Former RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons is a hero to so many people. He was honoured with an Officer of the Order of Australia for his work in leading the RFS during the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20, when six per cent of New South Wales or around 5½ million hectares of land was burnt. His leadership brought calm at time of great crisis. Justice Gary Watts has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia. Justice Watts was one of the leading practitioners of family law in Australia before his appointment to the Family Court in 2005, and since 2018 he's served on the appeals division of the Family Court. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Group Captain James Badgery was made a Member of the Order of Australia for exceptional service to the Australian Defence Force in aerospace capability development. Mr Kazi Ali, who's dedicated his life to serving the Muslim community in managing death and burial issues, was also recognised for his service to the Islamic community with a Medal of the Order. Another OAM recipient is Lorna Clayton, a resident of the Living Choice retirement village in Glenhaven. Just after settling into her new home, Lorna set up a writing group. Lorna did a letterbox drop in the village and asked people if they were interested. She managed to get a handful of people involved to give talks about things they'd written. The writing group still meets once a month and has spawned the retirement village's annual writers festival. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kay De Luca and her late husband, Tony, were also honoured for their service to motoring clubs. Mrs De Luca served as the treasurer and a committee member of the Council of Motor Clubs for 12 years and was also secretary-treasurer of the BMC-Leyland Australia Heritage Group, which was founded by her husband. Also honoured with an OAM was Beverley Garside, who was diagnosed with two autoimmune diseases in the mid-1980s. Following an operation, Beverley put her hand up for the Thyroid Foundation's committee nominations and was soon appointed president, in 1999. Beverley also raises awareness in the community about thyroid disorders and how people can best detect symptoms and changes to their thyroid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The late Lionel Smith was recognised for his services to firefighting. Lionel was a long-serving fire control officer in the Hills district and gave over 75 years of service to New South Wales firefighting organisations, with his first firefighting experience at age 15. Other OAM recipients include Bastiaan van Dongen, from Cherrybrook, for his service to the Dutch community; Professor Elizabeth McCusker, for her service to medicine as a neurologist, particularly in the field of Huntington's disease; Mr Bruce Wood, of Thornleigh, for his long service to cricket in our district; and Ms Susan Day, from Cheltenham, for her service to the community through a range of organisations, especially in the Beecroft community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Margaret Skewes was awarded a Public Service Medal for a long and very successful career in the New South Wales public service. Peter Jacobs was awarded an Australian Fire Service Medal for his outstanding work over 36 years in the RFS and Fire and Rescue NSW. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate all the recipients and encourage people in our electorate to nominate people for the Order of Australia. It's a wonderful way to recognise Australians of all walks of life for their achievements in the hard work that they do for our community.</span>

It's an event that I try to attend every year, and today I'm so sad not to be able to be there with Link-Up Queensland and all of the people who are joining together to commemorate this significant day. They're at QPAC and they're having an event at which people will be making speeches, including members of the stolen generations themselves, about our nation's history and our nation's future. I want to say to those people who are gathering together at Southbank that I do wish very much that I were with you today to commemorate this really significant occasion. I want to particularly acknowledge any of the stolen generations who have any connection with the former Cranbrook house, which is one of the places where people were taken and which Link-Up Queensland has had a long history of addressing in terms of bringing people back together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the CEO of Link-Up, Ms Pat Thompson AM. I really wish to congratulate her as well as acknowledge her. She was recently appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia, which was well deserved. She'll be there today and she'll be making sure that she continues that serious and solemn work of bringing together and reuniting families. I also want to acknowledge everyone else from Link-Up Queensland who works so hard to bring people together. These reunions can sometimes be very joyful occasions, but they can sometimes be very sad occasions, particularly the graveside reunions, which unfortunately feature all too often in the work of Link-Up Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, today this parliament will be acknowledging the anniversary of the apology. Each year, we remember the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report, which was tabled in the federal parliament on 26 May 1997 following a national inquiry commenced under the Keating government. That report recommended that there be an apology. It really emphasised the importance of apology and acknowledgement. It said the first step in any compensation and healing for victims of gross violations of human rights must be an acknowledgement of the truth and the delivery of an apology. That apology was finally given by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as I said, in 2008. As I said, it's the 14th anniversary of it this year, so I want to thank Kevin for that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">John's life began in a little terrace house in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, in 1938. He remembered his childhood during a time of war, vividly recollecting spending his nights sleeping in a cellar and listening to the bombs drop on the iron-and-steel works in Shelton. After leaving school, John worked in his parents' pub while attending night school, where he studied accountancy. He did national service in the army—the infantry—but he was demobbed after a year because his feet were too big and they couldn't find shoes big enough to fit them. Many who have crossed his path over the years, I'm sure, will have found his shoes too big to fill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John's love of children encouraged him to set up youth clubs, where he coached seven- to 21-year-olds in how to prepare speeches and play sport, from soccer and netball to even table tennis. His work ethic was best identified through his passion for the hotel industry, the love of which he inherited from his parents. At the age of 21 he took over a new pub of his own in Bass Worthington, which had only 1,500 homes under private ownership. John and his then wife became the youngest pub managers in the UK.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John, with his boxer dogs, emigrated to Australia in 1966, first working in Brisbane for a new Japanese crane manufacturing company, Kato cranes. He went on to become the president of the association of Australian crane manufacturers and distributors. John's commitment and passion over 12 years led him to become the general manager of the manufacturing plant for Kato cranes, before he was adopted by Coles Cranes, a British company that manufactured in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John's love, passion and talent for golf saw him devote his time at Windaroo golf club as the president from 1987 to 1990. Even when John decided it was time to retire, at the age of 65, he volunteered in my first-ever campaign and was instrumental in my success. His advice, encouragement and mentorship were very important to me over the years. After the election, John was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a version of leukaemia, and he went through chemotherapy and overcame his battle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although John had a love of pubs, boxer dogs and cranes, it never outweighed his love for his wife, Helen, and his daughter, Cathy. He was a great man who will be sorely missed by his community, and he will always be remembered. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I was so pleased to join literally hundreds of local families outside the St Kilda Town Hall just a couple of weeks ago, before the sitting period. We united to send a clear message to the City of Port Phillip: do not sell off our local childcare and childhood education centres. Do not sell off our early childhood centres—simple!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Port Phillip has been on this crusade based on incorrect information, provided by council officers, that councillors should sell off these places because there are some upgrades that need to happen to these local centres. There are. But the advice that was given to the councillors was that the state government would invest in upgrading these facilities only if there were a minimum 66 places, which is complete nonsense. It's complete nonsense and it is the whole basis on which the City of Port Phillip has gone through this long and really upsetting process to sell off our incredible local childcare and childhood education centres. They don't need to sell them. The state government, thanks to an excellent letter written by the Minister for Early Childhood, Ms Ingrid Stitt, has come to the table and said to the City of Port Phillip, loud and clear: 'We are at the table. Do not sell off these early childhood centres. We are going to be there to support you and to support the City of Port Phillip. We understand that you can't do it on your own. There is money available. It doesn't matter how big or small these centres are, the state government is here to help fund them.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an absolute turning point that the City of Port Phillip should grasp and say, 'We're going to pause all intentions to sell and we're going sit down in good faith with the state government and work our way through the upgrades that need to happen at these centres.' That's what should happen today. Instead, over the last week, the City of Port Phillip have been issuing public intention-to-sell notices. The mayor attended the rally with hundreds of families. Councillors attended the rally with hundreds of families. This is something where the council isn't going to have to fix it by itself. There's a $6 million maintenance levy fund that have been funding the centres, which should be utilised in partnership with the state government. My message to the City of Port Phillip is: 'Stop. Stop your plan to sell off our local childcare and childhood centres. You don't need to sell them. You have a partner in the state government who is willing, in good faith, to join you.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of the parents who have spoken up and who have led this campaign. We will keep fighting. I would urge the City of Port Phillip to end this crusade to sell off our centres. Now is not the time to do it. They are too valuable, and we need them to continue. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VASTA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  My electorate of Bonner is home to a great array of innovative businesses. In particular the port of Brisbane is a booming hub of Australian manufacturing success stories and local job opportunities, ranging from manufacturing to freight and logistics, technology innovation, maritime industries and warehouse storage. Like many across Australia, these businesses have faced challenges during the COVID pandemic, but I'm happy to say that the port of Brisbane hub is now thriving with the help of our federal government support packages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the pleasure of hosting the Treasurer at The Yard Brisbane in Hemmant, where we saw firsthand the benefits of the federal government's economic support programs. The Yard is an incredible maritime business that constructs and maintains vessels of all types and classes, from tugs and barges to high-speed passenger ferries and superyachts. Julie and Nick from The Yard spoke to the Treasurer and me about the benefits of using JobKeeper, the instant asset write-off and the export market development grants. Julie told us that these programs have enabled them to keep over 400 staff employed, meaning more money in the pockets and food on the table for so many local families. Not only that, federal government supports have allowed The Yard to plan for the future and expand their operations, creating more local jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another vital business in the port of Brisbane hub is Lineage Logistics. Lineage Logistics might not be a household name, but they have kept food on the kitchen tables right across Australia during the height of the pandemic. Lineage Logistics are experts in cold-food storage and have serviced businesses like Woolworths. Recently, I was able to meet with Lineage to thank them for their work during the pandemic and to tour their impressive facilities. The conversations that I had with people like Jay, the operations manager from Lineage, also gave me a greater understanding of supply chain challenges and how they will be able to address them into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, like many industries during COVID-19, Lineage have faced labour shortages. Thankfully, they were able to partner with OZ Labourforce, who quickly filled the gap of employee shortages. OZ Labourforce are a great local business that I recently had the pleasure of meeting in the port of Brisbane hub. They were able to supply skilled, reliable labour that kept Lineage operations running and food on supermarket shelves for Australian families. OZ Labourforce benefited from our government's JobKeeper package. They told me that they are thankful for the ongoing supports that have kept their workers employed and their trucks moving across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bonner is home to businesses with a wealth of knowledge, resources and a skilled labour force. These businesses are leaders in their fields, not only in Australia but across the globe. I'm proud to be working with, and delivering for, Australian businesses, and keeping jobs and opportunities local. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Daryl Burge-Lopez, who passed away last month. He had recently been in poor health, but his death at 78 was not expected. Daryl had three loves in his life: his family, his friends and the Labor Party. He was a long-time member of the Homedale branch of the Barton electorate. He first joined the Labor Party in Victoria, in the then federal seat of Yarra, held by Jim Cairns, and involved himself with many of the anti-Vietnam War protests. This started his lifelong love of politics and campaigning for a just society. He was with his cousin Barbara when he was admitted to hospital. Barbara and her granddaughter Chloe were very special to Daryl, and I extend my sincere condolences to each of them. I also extend my condolences to his brother Peter and his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Daryl had many friends, but his closest friend was David Dawson. They were known as 'the odd couple' by local ALP members. I think they were both Oscar Madisons actually! Rather than playing a regular game of cards, like Felix and Oscar, they met each day at a local coffee lounge and argued about nothing in particular—often extending their arguments, I'm told, to two sessions at the cafe, morning and afternoon, with a break for lunch. David, I know my office can't fill the gap left by Daryl, but you are always welcome to come and discuss any day's issues with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Daryl was a good son, caring for his mother until her death. Each week he took her to the hairdresser, met David for coffee and then came to my office to discuss issues, before collecting his mum and going home. His last debate with my staff was over which seats Labor would win at the next election. Sadly we can't finish that debate. Election campaigning was Daryl's greatest motivator. He was happiest on the hustings. He had a unique style, I have to say, that often prompted calming words from the returning officer and, on the odd occasion, the police! Daryl was a bookseller and had a fantastic library which he shared with people. I want to thank Daryl for his lifelong devotion to the Labor Party, for his friendship and for his support of Labor in Barton. Thank you, Daryl, for our memories of a true Labor stalwart. You will be very sadly missed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Sometimes there are moments that give me an enormous sense of privilege, honour and deep gratitude to be serving as the member for Robertson. I actually want to pay tribute to my colleague on the other side of the chamber the member for Barton. I had the absolute privilege of going this weekend to visit the Glen for Women in Yarramalong. It's due to open in late April. There will be 20 beds. It is one of the most extraordinary, most beautiful places that you will ever visit. The tranquillity, the beauty, the care and the thoughtfulness of every single aspect of the design are something we can all be incredibly proud of. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that has been a long-held dream for so many people here on the Central Coast, and particularly the incredible community at the Glen for men, led by Joe Coyte but surrounded by an incredible community, every single one of them determined to never leave another person behind. In saying this, I want to pay tribute to some incredible female voices in that community—Aunty Cheryl, Aunty Coral and Aunty Jan—who were absolutely determined to see the success of the Glen for men replicated in a centre that we are now seeing become a reality. It is due to open in late April, thanks to a $9 million investment from the federal government but actually driven by determination, passion and a vision of this incredible community and these women who were determined to make sure that their daughters and their granddaughters would not be left behind and that the experiences of the past, the challenges of the past, would not be the challenges of the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the incredible privilege to be able to bring the Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon. Ken Wyatt, to visit the Glen for Women at Yarramalong. We also had the opportunity to meet with the Darkinjung Aboriginal Land Council and the NAISDA Dance College at Kariong. This commitment, this investment, this incredible centre of hope, is about more than just beds and a program around drug and alcohol rehabilitation that is culturally appropriate. This is about a heart, a community, a family, a determination to make sure that we have a better future tomorrow than what we have today, for all Australians. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's neglect of the aged-care sector and its failure to prepare and plan during the pandemic has led to residents being locked down, isolated and disorientated without enough food and water, with wounds untended and incontinence pads unchanged. This is unconscionable abuse of our elderly citizens, and it isn't caused by aged-care workers or providers; it is caused by this federal government. The sector has deteriorated shockingly under the coalition government due to its serious neglect over the past nine years. Funding cuts, inadequate staff-to-patient ratios, low wages and a casualised workforce have all led to a system buckling under intense pressure. This was happening well before the COVID-19 pandemic but has now become a full-blown crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our fathers, mothers, grandparents, aunts and uncles all deserve better in their old age. They've worked hard their entire lives, paid their taxes, volunteered in their communities and raised their families. They deserve to live out their twilight years with dignity and respect. Instead, we have heard story after story, hundreds of harrowing stories, from aged-care nurses, workers and family members about the extremely poor conditions in which our elderly folk are living in aged care. These stories are appalling and they have shocked me to my core. It is truly unacceptable. I don't want any family of mine or yours in federally run aged care as it currently stands. Severely neglected, underfunded and poorly resourced during the pandemic, it's a national disgrace. Aged-care workers are trying their best to give high-quality care to residents, and I thank them for everything they do. But, with little support from the government, they are frustrated, devastated they cannot provide the high-quality care that residents deserve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care workers have spoken out in desperation. Many feel they are working on a factory production line, not in an aged-care environment, with only five minutes to shower frail residents and with responsibility to care for 20-plus patients or residents at a time. It is physically and emotionally demanding work by people who are among the lowest paid workers in our economy. Staff shortages are hammering the sector. At least 25 per cent of aged-care worker shifts are not being filled. The Morrison government has announced it will bring in the ADF—an acknowledgement the system is in crisis. But how on earth are 1,700 Defence Force personnel to cover more than 140,000 shifts a week? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compounding these problems, we now know that 60 per cent of aged-care workers and at least 60,000 residents still haven't received their boosters, and aged-care homes don't have enough rapid antigen tests or PPE for staff. These are vital measures for protection against the pandemic, and this government has completely failed to deliver them. There are currently over 10,000 active COVID cases among staff and residents, and more than 680 aged-care residents have died with COVID since 1 January this year. That's an average of 17 residents dying every single day.  This latest outbreak has forced aged-care facilities around the country to lock down and confine residents to their rooms because they don't have enough RATs, PPE or boosters being delivered. Many residents feel like prisoners. This is inhumane and unnecessary, and it should never have happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is responsible for the aged-care system. He failed to listen to 21 expert reports and he even failed to listen to the recommendation of his own royal commission. I call on this government to immediately provide adequate PPE and rapid antigen tests to aged-care facilities, to expediate the vaccine booster program for staff and residents and to address the issue of staff shortages by listening to the sector and what it needs. Aged-care workers are heroes. They've been working on the front line during the pandemic, while the aged-care minister attends the cricket and the Prime Minister plays the ukulele! Across my electorate, indeed right across Australia, aged-care workers are pleading with the Morrison government to step up and support them, not with a paltry and insulting payment, which many won't get, but with proper planning, action and leadership from this federal government, which has failed to protect our most vulnerable Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to speak on this very important issue. As a 42-year-old, I'm in that stage of life where we go from our parents caring for us to us caring for our parents. It's a strange transition to make, and you get your first real view of human frailty. I think it's important that we are all very clear and aware of the challenges that this sector faces. People in this vulnerable time of their lives do have some peculiar challenges, and it's very important that we address those and that we are upfront about those. I was very glad to see this government call the royal commission. I'm very glad to see that we've wanted to address that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal level, it's incredibly important to me. My father is currently a recipient of home-care support. He's one of these grumpy old men—and I'm happy to double down on the 'grumpy old men'—in need of care, and home care gives him the freedom and ability to live in his own house with some level of control, which I think is so important. I think also of the wonderful home care provided at the Naroo Frail Aged Care Facility, in Warialda. Sadly, far too many members of my family have required care, particularly my grandmother and my Uncle Donald, both of whom required significant care, as dementia played a big role in their later years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would disagree with the member opposite's summation. The Australian government is delivering significant, once-in-a-generation change in the sector through a $17.7 billion reform package. This is already delivering more home-care places and more funding for residential aged care. It's increasing the amount of time that residents are cared for, whilst strengthening the regulators to monitor and enforce the standard of care. And it's right that we do this. It's absolutely right that we meet the needs of our senior Australians, now and into the future, while undertaking the urgent reforms recommended by the aged-care royal commission. There is important work for us to do in this important space, but I'm very proud to be part of a government that is facing that challenge head-on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms and investments that we're already seeing are especially important in my electorate of Groom, where more than 25,000 seniors rely upon aged-care services. While home care has an important role to play, as in the case of my father, it's important that we do not see it as a replacement for residential aged care and that we continue to make strides in that area as well. Ultimately, some people will require 24/7 monitoring, and we need to ensure that high-quality facilities are available to them, no matter where they live, to provide the level of care and support that their families would expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm proud this government has made significant investment into aged-care facilities in my region to upgrade and expand their offerings. I think of Beauaraba Living in Pittsworth. It has received a total of $2.3 million of federal funding, which has assisted it to deliver a $9.1 million upgrade to its facility. I think it's the best accommodation in Pittsworth. I love to go out there and see the facilities. It's absolutely fantastic and a credit to the people at Beauaraba and to the amazing staff out there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This upgrade included the creation of new bed wings and the construction of a new wellness centre. The federally-supported upgrades also included the construction of two 13-bed memory support houses, which will allow Beauaraba to provide dementia care in a specialised environment more commonly known as a house model. The amazing aspect of this approach is that every part of the facility is designed to provide care and comfort to the residents, particular those who are battling with dementia, from the paintings on the walls to the design of the furniture. There's an incredible garden space and huge living area, to encourage family members to come in and be part of the experience there for the residents. It's so important that they keep those relationships alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of the government's commitment to bettering aged care in my area has been the funding provided to Blue Care in Rangeville. This is an $8.9 million investment towards an $18.4 million upgrade, providing a significant boost to that facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Toowoomba is projected to have significant growth in its aged-care population over the coming decade. The over-70s are growing at three per cent per annum—a significant rate—and, by 2036, people over 70 will make up more than 19 per cent of the region's population. I'm glad to see us continuing to invest in this crucial sector in my area.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">O</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">pposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  Nearly 40 years ago, my relatively young mother had to go to a residential aged-care facility. With multiple sclerosis robbing her of the body that worked and leaving her bedridden, it was no longer safe for her to live at home. Her nursing home was full of wonderful, dedicated staff who cared for her and their other patients. There were several registered nurses on every shift, enrolled nurses and occupational therapists. But my sister and I still made sure we went every day to help feed her and make sure she was comfortable, because, when we helped by volunteering, it meant that others were assisted more quickly, especially at mealtimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's fast forward to now. Twenty-two reports and the aged-care royal commissioners have told us that the system is broken. Too many aged-care residents are malnourished. Does the government realise what that means for our elderly? Our most vulnerable are starving. Let that sink in for a moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this circumstance, how can there be so little action to fix the system which is tasked to look after our aged population when they can no longer safely stay at home? These residents are people who saw through the worst of the Great Depression, world wars and financial crises. They are our beloved grandparents or parents, and the government has left them languishing, ignoring report after report, until we find ourselves here in the current crisis. And they all deserve so much better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reports have detailed solutions. Yet, rather than there being change for the better, the situation has just got worse, however much money is spent. The government points to how much money they've put into the system, but then why, under this government's watch, has nothing changed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been more than 600 deaths in aged care just this year, and it's not even the end of February. Again, aged-care residents were not prioritised in the rollout of booster vaccinations. Lockdowns have been difficult for all of us, but just take a moment to consider what they've been like if you've been a resident in aged care. The vaccines were slow and there are many who still have not had their booster shots. They've spent countless days isolating in their rooms, probably terrified of what will happen next, with personal care limited at best. Not only does this directly affect their physical and mental health, but it has robbed so many of spending their final days with their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently there have been comments in the media that you only go into aged care because you're going to die, and whilst for many, many people this isn't the case, it is, however, all the more reason to make sure that those final days, months or years are as comfortable as possible. You should not be tortured with a lack of food or stimulation, or by not having wounds treated properly or not even being able to see the ones you love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to many aged-care workers over the last few years. They are dedicated and caring, and they do what they do because they know there is a need and they just love the residents they work with. It is certainly not for the money, because they average $22 an hour, and many have to work multiple jobs and split shifts just to pay the bills. But they continue to prop up this system in crisis, because they have a conscience and don't want to let anyone down. Clearly, it's unreasonable to keep looking to their good nature. With 140,000 shifts in aged care not filled, the 1,700 defence personnel, although welcome, will hardly make a dent and are not a sustainable solution. While the Prime Minister's promise of an $800 payment goes some way towards recognising just how much these workers have borne the brunt of the dysfunctional system and the stresses of the pandemic, it's a one-off payment, and not nearly enough and not soon enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must find solutions now as we enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aged care remains in crisis. More than 12,000 aged-care residents and workers currently have COVID, in more than 1,100 aged-care homes. If rapid antigen tests were available and free to staff and visitors, many of these outbreaks might not have occurred. Too many aged-care residents are still waiting for the COVID-19 booster dose. Aged-care homes have been left with insufficient personal protective equipment and shortages of RATs. Older Australians deserve to be treated so much better, and it's time the government did just that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  Every year since 1990, in the times I've come into this House, gone out of this House and come back into it, aged care has been an issue. Aged care has been an issue for all of that time. Every year, under every government—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BROADBENT:</span>
                  </a>  listen closely—home-care packages are up, residential care places are up; every year, aged-care funding is up. When I came here, we spent $3 billion on aged care—$3 billion. Under the Howard government, it went from $3 billion to $9 billion to $11 billion. I remember, at the close of the Howard era, I went to Mr Howard and he said, 'Don't ask me for more money for aged care, Russell. You've had enough.' Of course, there was never going to be enough, because we had an exponential rise in the number of older people. And the models that we used, as I told many of the aged-care facilities in my electorate, when people went in at an earlier age and actually stayed for some five, eight, nine, 10 years, completely changed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of home-care packages, we are putting people into aged-care centres when they are much older and when they are much frailer. When you put them in—when they go in of their own free will, I should say—their health and lifestyle and wellbeing improve dramatically, and then, sadly, goes. Death and taxes. We all know we're going to die. That's why aged care should not be somewhere you go to die; it's somewhere you go for a really good part of your latter years. It should be a good experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Werriwa speak most passionately about the care her mother received. And it's the care my mum received, my dad received, and my father-in-law and my mother-in-law received from aged-care sector providers. They have all passed away. But, in my electorate, is there a crisis in care? No. If anything, there's a crisis in the fact that no government, in the whole time that I've been here, has been able to keep up enough funding to make sure that everybody's getting a fair go. You've got to have a really close look at the models. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My not-for-profits are amazing, the way they approach aged care—and I have to say my for-profits in that care do very well too. In my time as federal member for Corinella, then for McMillan and then for Monash, I would have had three inquiries regarding difficulties that people were having in aged care, and we were able to resolve every one of them. We have amazing providers in Gippsland. Now, my electorate might be a one-off and unusual; I don't know. But I am so proud of my aged-care providers and those who work for them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Have we got difficulties at the moment? We sure have. It's called COVID. It's called a pandemic. My providers, like many others, struggle getting the right PPE, the right approach and the right masks. How do we go about this? How do we engage with our community? Many had been cut off from their community, with Victoria being in lockdown so many times. Have there been difficulties? Absolutely there have been difficulties. How have they been handled? To the best of the provider's ability. We have worked with them closely through all of that to make sure that those people, who are part of our most vulnerable community—and there are so many others—are the ones who are specifically cared for in our community. I just don't know how they were able to work so closely with the broader community to enable them to deliver, and they're still delivering every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will always be more money needed in aged care. We will always take this as a very important part of what governments do. We will be judged, one day, on our ability to provide services to older Australians. They deserve that respect and they deserve that encouragement.</span>

Respect is what aged-care workers have not seen from this government. This government is constantly attacking workers, and never more so than when it comes to aged-care workers. I commend the member for Corangamite for bringing on this critical motion at this vital time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Sometimes she's not showered, or she's hasn't been changed on a regular basis. And so when I'm in there I have to do those things. I have to take care of her because the staff are run off their feet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That story is common in many aged-care centres across Australia. This isn't a crisis that has suddenly snuck up on us. It was even in the pre-COVID era. Alex Reid's mother, Nancy, worked alongside Edward 'Weary' Dunlop to care for returned soldiers after World War II. Alex said that he had to supply incontinence pads because there weren't enough available in the aged-care centre and when he looked at her oxygen he realised that it hadn't been connected properly. He, as a trained scuba-diving instructor, was then asked to do training for the aged-care staff in that centre. He was happy to do it, but he shouldn't have had to. That training should have been there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the recent omicron wave all residential aged-care facilities in Canberra have registered COVID cases, and there have been six deaths reported. The ACT Health team and Canberra Health Services have responded remarkably well to those pressures, but they have been dealing with a situation that has been made worse by the neglect of the Morrison government, by the failure of the vaccine rollout and by the failure of the booster rollout. We know that there are 80,000 residents awaiting their booster and that, if more had been boostered, we might not have seen more than 400 COVID aged-care deaths in January.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lack of access to rapid antigen tests impacted aged care because it made it so much more difficult for visitors to check their COVID status before they visited. Workers in the aged-care sector have described it as a 'war zone'. What did the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services do? He went to the cricket for three days. This minister follows in the footsteps of Bronwyn Bishop, who had to step down as aged care minister in 2002 over the kerosene baths scandal. So, while the member opposite pretends that aged care has been an issue the coalition has always stood for, in the end he admits that John Howard said that he didn't want to put any more money into the sector. That is the attitude of the Liberals when it comes to aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to clear the home-care package waiting list. Over recent years, tens of thousands of people have died while waiting for a home-care package. We need better workforce conditions, better wages for staff and better training for staff in the aged-care sector. The Productivity Commission found that the average wait for a home-care package was 28 months. The government's marginal increase in the number of packages fell massively short of what was required. We have aged-care staff who are living in poverty because the wages they are receiving are less than what they might receive for stacking shelves in retail, worthy as that job is. We have reports of physical abuse, neglect and malnutrition being rampant throughout the aged-care sector. We have, as a result of the omicron wave, an impact on the sector which is worse than they have ever seen before. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sector in crisis, and it needs more than short-term, stopgap, attempted solutions from the Morrison government. Yes, it is important to call on the Australian Defence Force to do what it can to assist, but let's not pretend that that is a sustainable, ongoing solution to the systemic problems in aged care. They must be fixed, and the only way they will be fixed is under an Albanese Labor government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  The truth is that, for all their bluster across the chamber, the challenges that continue in the aged-care sector predate the Liberal-National government. It was the Labor government of the day who underfunded and facilitated the dismantling of Australia's aged-care system and put the care of our respected senior Australians at risk to start with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has put a spotlight on the entire aged-care system, recognising the deep structural changes needed to reform and return Australia's aged-care system to a world-class, leading senior support and care sector. We listened to the experiences of Australians who gave evidence to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, and we are taking decisive action to implement the recommendations, with reforms to deliver vital services, improved quality care and viability in aged care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is making significant reforms that are paramount to the structural integrity of the aged-care sector, including those announced throughout the royal commission's inquiry and the COVID-19 pandemic and in the immediate response to the release of the royal commission's final report. The Morrison government's principles for reforming the aged-care sector are made up of the three key pillars we've heard: respect, care and dignity. Without these principles and Liberal values, our aged-care system is at risk of returning to the old habits left by previous Labor governments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission's final report made 148 recommendations—123 joint recommendations, 18 additional recommendations by Commissioner Briggs and seven additional recommendations by the chair, Commissioner Pagone. The government has accepted 127 of the recommendations and supported an alternative approach to four recommendations where commissioners had differing views. Twelve recommendations require further consideration, and another six recommendations to raise taxes and fees for senior Australians and their families were rejected. It's important to note that Labor criticised the government for not accepting the recommendations that would have posed a major financial burden on the consumer, our senior Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through our $17.7 billion aged-care reform package, the Australian government is focused directly on delivering a once-in-a-generation change. The government is investing record funding across the aged-care system over the forward estimates. From $13.3 billion in 2012-13 under Labor, it has grown to $26 billion in 2021-22—significant growth. Funding for aged care will grow to an estimated $32.8 billion in 2024-25. Residential care funding in 2021-22 is $15 billion, up from $9.2 billion in 2012-13, and it's estimated that, by 2024-25, this will grow to over $19.5 billion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care homes are often a last resort for senior Australians who can no longer support themselves independently. That's why the Morrison government is providing senior Australians with support to live in their homes longer. New home-care packages have increased from 60,308 under those opposite in 2012-13 to 275,597 in 2024-25, an increase of 357 per cent—silence from the other side of the chamber. Over the same period, funding will increase by 518 per cent due to growth in high-level packages. As at 8 February the Morrison government had dispatched over 117 million rapid antigen testing kits, and it continues to maintain commitment and supply, dispatching to pharmacies across the country and into the hands of Australians, especially those who are most vulnerable to the effects of this virus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Collectively these amendments form the second step in the government's five-year reform agenda, through the five key pillars for reform, which are home care; residential aged-care services and sustainability; residential aged-care quality and safety; workforce; and governance. Competent and effective governance provides the basis on which the aged-care sector delivers its services. The Morrison government has strengthened legislative arrangements to improve the governance of approved providers, and these amendments align with the royal commission recommendations 88 to 90, which note that good provider governance arrangements result in high-quality care for consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this will improve the financial resilience of the industry, improve service continuity and allow the government to identify at-risk providers sooner rather than later. I'm proud that we're fixing the problems in the aged-care sector without raising taxes and fees. As long as the Liberal-National coalition is in government, we'll continue to be dedicated to working for all Australians—for you, for your mum and dad and for your grandmother and grandfather.</span>

I want to thank her for putting forward this motion and for all of her work in that sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start by saying thank you. I want to say thank you to the staff in our aged-care sector who are working around the clock to look after some of the most vulnerable and most important Australians that we've got. I also want to say thank you to the staff who are looking after my grandparents. I am deeply grateful not just for the care and effort that they put into supporting my grandparents but for their professionalism, their skill and their commitment to producing high-quality care for people that I love, and not just for them but for all of their fellow aged-care residents as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, our aged-care staff don't have many choices, unlike this government. Our aged-care staff don't have the choice to go to the cricket instead of turning up to work. Our aged-care staff don't have the choice to just take three days off and head down to watch Mitchell Starc bowl a few balls. That's just not a choice that is available for our aged-care staff. Our aged-care staff don't have the choice to, instead of turning up for work, do ridiculous TV appearances playing the ukulele. It's absurd and it's silly, but that's not a choice that our aged-care staff have. They have to turn up to work, in conditions that are extremely challenging, where they are constantly in need of extra support and in need of extra resources. Our aged-care staff don't have the choice to just lay down tools. They have to work their guts out in order to support the people in our aged-care homes. I just want to say thank you to all of them for all of their efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they need is not just thanks. They also need a significant pay rise, and it would be a profound gesture of support if the federal government, instead of telling everyone in the aged-care sector how good they've got it, actually supported our aged-care workers in the Fair Work Commission in their case for a permanent pay rise—not just some election cash splashes like this government is very fond of but a recognition that the work that they do is important and high skilled, that delivering high-quality aged care is something fundamental that we as Australians respect and hold dear and that older Australians, people who have given this country everything, at the very least should be met with the level of care and support that each and every human being is worthy of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, instead, the government will often cite facts and figures and macro figures about how much they're spending, about their record spending in the sector, saying they've sent this many masks and this much PPE, citing 70,000 hours of shifts—all high-level figures that have been put together by some operators in various ministers' offices. But they haven't actually addressed the issues in the sector. It's all very well and good to send X many masks into aged care. That's good—of course it's good, but it's not fixing the problems in the sector. We have chronic staff shortages, staff who are paid less than many of those who work in our supermarkets stacking shelves. Our supermarket workers have been heroic throughout this pandemic, and this is not in any way a reflection on them; it's a reflection on saying, 'We need to value our workers properly in this country,' and at the moment our aged-care workers are some of the most undervalued and underpaid workers, due to the attitudes of this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to hear facts and figures from the minister for health and the minister for aged care. The minister for aged care hasn't actually been able to provide accurate facts and figures throughout this whole thing. Putting that aside, we don't want to hear facts about what record spending this government is doing, because it's rubbish. What we want to see is action that actually addresses the chronic staff shortages, the huge waiting lists in home care, the neglect of some of our most important Australians. We need change, and it starts with this government. </span>

In the aftermath of World War II, thousands of Poles fleeing that dark era in our history, when nations fell into the darkness of communism and oppression, migrated to Australia. Among them were my grandfather, my grandmother and my father. These were people who sought refuge in Australia, dreaming of hope and the opportunities their new home would offer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decades on, Australia and Poland's relationship remains stronger than it's ever been. Polish Australians have made and continue to make significant contributions to all aspects of Australian society, from sharing their diverse culture to their vital role in our nation's economic success and innovation. The Polish community in Australia today are dedicated to preserving our history and promoting Polish-Australian cultural ties through the work of numerous community clubs and groups across our nation. Polish Australians strive to enrich the lives of those around us by both acknowledging our heritage and appreciating our new home. Members of the Polish community should be proud of all we have accomplished and contributed to Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The presence of an Australian embassy in Warsaw is central to our bilateral relationship. The embassy offers significant support to Australians visiting and living in Poland. The embassy never fails to promote the spirit of Australia in Poland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2015 and 2019, total merchandise trade between Australia and Poland grew by 11 per cent. In 2019 Australian investment in Poland reached $1.2 billion, and Australians enjoyed nearly $2 billion worth of merchandise imports from Poland. In terms of exports, Poland continues to seek Australian resources and services to support its growing economy. Both nations benefit from our strong bilateral academic and business relationships. I'm proud to be part of a government that remains cognisant of the benefit of free trade and accordingly continuously seeks opportunities to promote Australian business abroad. I commended the work of the Australian embassy in promoting Australian trade and investment interests in Poland and the numerous Australian companies that already operate in Poland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to our cultural and economic support of each other, Poland and Australia are true friends. Both nations have proven their commitment to our relationship time and time again through numerous formal agreements and gestures of goodwill. For example, in 2012 the Australian government donated half a million dollars to support the preservation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial site. Frank Lowry, an Australian businessman, and his family were instrumental in preserving that site so we will never forget the atrocities that can occur when we turn around and walk away. Following the Black Summer bushfires the Kosciuszko National Park, which Polish people would pronounce differently to the way we pronounce it, received generous donations from Poland. With Australia's borders reopening I look forward to welcoming back many Polish visitors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I want to mention is that a dark period in our history was the totalitarian state that took over Poland, which is a proud nation. For hundreds of years it didn't exist except in the hearts and spirits of Polish people. But when freedom came, it first came to Poland through Lech Walesa and the boatyards, and millions of its people were set free. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  Yes, I rise to second the motion moved by the member for Mackellar. Polish Australians have made a great contribution to this country over the last 50 years and way back further, prior to formal diplomatic relations between our two countries. Following the atrocities of the Second World War, Australia received an influx of Polish refugees. The Polish born population increased from 6½ thousand to more than 56,000 people between the years of 1957 and 1966. Most arrived from war-torn Europe, though some came from various fields of battle having fought with Australians throughout the war, such as in Tobruk. Many brought with them memories of the horrors of the war, some from concentration camps and others from various fronts. Though they were grateful to find a welcoming home, it was the new Polish Australian community that got them through these horrors and helped them to settle into their new home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This lasting connection with their homeland has meant a thriving diaspora community exists in Australia, with a significant presence through community groups as well as sporting clubs. These are particularly prevalent in my home city of Melbourne, which has the largest Polish Australian population in the country. That Polish Australian community has blessed us with people like Dr Karl, Magda Szubanski, the member for Mackellar and, of course, the terrific Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, though, I want to tell the story of one Pole in particular, who is not as well known. His name is Slawomir, or Stan, Lasek. Stan was born in Warsaw in 1926 and was barely a teenager when Poland was invaded in 1939. Like so many young Poles, Stan was unable to complete his education. He took up arms and joined the Polish resistance, fighting mainly in the mountains in Poland's south. He was caught by the Germans and arrested, but managed to escape and rose through the ranks, fighting proudly in defence of his country. Stan Lasek lost his father and many other family members in the war, some in the deadly concentration camps established by the German regime. When the war came to an end in 1945, Stan decided to flee Poland, which came under the control of Russia, and he started a new life in England, where he married Barbara and they had four sons. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the late 1960s Stan and Barbara made what they described as the best decision of their life, emigrating to Australia. The family settled in Wollongong, where Stan worked at the Port Kembla steelworks. He coached junior soccer and he was without doubt one of the biggest supporters of the Socceroos as they created history by qualifying for the World Cup finals for the first time in 1974.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stan, Barbara and the boys didn't hesitate in becoming naturalised Australian citizens in the early seventies, and in 1975 Stan and Barbara joined tens of thousands of others outraged by the dismissal of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and taking to the streets in protest. Stan loved Australia's landscape, such a far cry from the dense forests of his native Poland. In 1988, having moved to the bush, he was named the Gulargambone citizen of the year for his amazing tree-planting efforts, trying to green one of the driest parts of our continent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his later years, Stan travelled to Canberra to receive his long-overdue wartime medals from the Polish ambassador. What made Stan even prouder, though, was receiving Poland's highest military medal—posthumous—on behalf of his late father, Antonio, who was recognised as a national hero by those who fought with him in World War II. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stan Lasek, like so many, was a proud Pole. He had risked his life for his birthplace, but, like so many of his compatriots, it is Australia that made him happiest. Stan would have turned 96 last week, and, while, sadly, he's no longer with us, his memory and his legacy continue to live on through his four proud boys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stan is a terrific example of the contributions of our Polish Australian community and the values that form the basis of the relationship between those two peoples, and it is these shared values that must underpin this relationship for years to come. In recent times, Poland and the European Union have been in a bitter feud over a wide array of issues. These include efforts to marginalise its LGBTIQ community, its assertion that Polish law is paramount to EU law and its reluctance to phase out fossil fuels in line with Europe's ambitious climate policy and to move away from the independence of its judiciary. On this 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, we are reminded of Australia's responsibility to engage with allies like Poland on issues such as these and to assert the importance of these issues as core to our relationship.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I rise to speak on this private member's motion moved by the member for Mackellar, and I commend him for his fine words. I commend also the member for Cooper—Stan Lasek's story is a story that is so typical not just of Poles but of people from so many countries all around the world. It's a fabulous migrant story, and thank you for sharing it with the House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Poland is a good friend of Australia's, and indeed, as the member for Mackellar has indicated with this motion, our friendship extends beyond the half-century of formal years of diplomatic relations. Our ties with this small country, which is only about four per cent the size of Australia, are in fact far greater and far longer than that. Our ties stretch back to World War II, as the member for Mackellar indicated, in the trenches of Europe, defending Allied territory against Adolf Hitler in the protection of freedom, with our troops, our diggers, our men, our women as well, making sure that they did what they could to prevent the spread of totalitarianism and, later on, communism. Our troops fought alongside Poles in the siege of Tobruk in 1941, and a number of Australian aircrews flew in support of the Warsaw uprising in 1944.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, in August 2021, the Australian government, working with our friends in Poland, was able to strike a deal to secure more than a million Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to help support our vaccination campaign—our vaccination campaign which has been one of the most successful in the world, I might add—and the outbreak last year in Sydney. We are grateful to our many, many Polish friends for this assistance at one of the most serious times of the pandemic here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to home and highlighting the connection between the Riverina, my electorate in the Central West, and Poland, I'm proud that the town of Cowra, known for being home to Australia's World Peace Bell, holds an annual festival known as the Festival of International Understanding. This festival highlights the customs and traditions of a different country each year, and in 2006 Poland was the feature country. Regrettably, I was not the local MP at the time; Cowra was then in Hume. But, from all accounts, there was plenty of traditional dancing and Polish cuisine such as pierogi, potatoes, sauerkraut, pickled cucumbers and plenty of vodka, I'm told.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to trade: Poland is a growing market for Australia. Between 2015 and 2019, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reported that two-way trade between our two nations experienced growth of 11.2 per cent per annum, valued at nearly $20 billion. That's a lot of money. Our major exports to Poland include coal, ores and other concentrates. The Riverina and Central West regions are home to a number of mines—not coalmines but gold and copper mines—with the CMOC-Northparkes mine in Parkes and the Evolution mine at Lake Cowal, near West Wyalong. I trust and hope that some of the exceptional minerals that are extracted from the ground there make their way to Poland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018 Australia was proud to host a visit from the President of Poland, and, just as we were pleased to welcome His Excellency Andrzej Duda—when we're not in the middle of a pandemic—we usually welcome thousands of Polish visitors to our shores. When those borders are lifted, I'm sure they're going to be coming flocking back to work, to visit, to play and to catch up, of course, with relatives. Up until June 2020, we welcomed about 17,400 tourists to Australia and almost 500 working holiday-makers. That shows the great relationship between Australia and Poland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the borders reopening very soon, I encourage more Polish tourists to come back and consider visiting my electorate—from Warsaw to Wagga Wagga!—and indeed they will certainly be very welcome. They can pick cherries at Young. They can help out wherever they can, as a farmhand or in any of our other great industries throughout the electorate. Perhaps they may make lifelong memories, and, today being St Valentine's Day, maybe they might even come to Australia and fall in love—not just with the place but also with an Australian here—further strengthening the strong ties that Australia and Poland have enjoyed for 50 years. May this association continue for many more years to come.</span>

This is, indeed, a significant milestone, which underlines the very strong partnership between our nations. It's an important occasion that is most certainly worth recognising and celebrating in the Australian parliament today. The contribution of the Polish community to Australia's social, cultural and economic life is immense. It's estimated that over 200,000 Australians have Polish ancestry, and, as well as celebrating this important milestone, I want to take some time today to acknowledge the enormous contribution of Poles to my community of Newcastle.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly one of the largest groups of migrants to come to Newcastle as part of the postwar wave of migration were the Polish people. They have changed our city for the better in so many ways. The very first intake of displaced peoples from postwar Europe arrived in the Hunter region via the port of Newcastle back in 1949, and, up until 1960, there was a migrant camp established in a town called Greta, in the Hunter, which became home to more than 100,000 people. Some 18 different nations from war-ravaged Europe were represented by the people passing through that camp, but the Polish community were indeed amongst that group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 10,000 babies were actually born in the Greta migrant camp during its life span, and, while there's nothing really left of that camp anymore, there are exceptionally strong memories of that place when you talk to members of the Polish community in Newcastle. It was a city unto itself. It had its own water and sewerage, a hospital and a transport division—buses, ambulances, the whole works. It had cinemas. People have very fond memories of all sorts of activities that they were organising at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Men from the migrant camp in Greta were sent all around the place to work. Many of those men came into Mayfield, in my electorate, to stay at a hostel which was very close to the BHP steelworks. Whilst that old hostel in Mayfield West is off limits now, the building has survived all these years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the men who arrived in Newcastle in 1949 and grew up at the Greta camp was the late John Gebhardt. I really want to pay tribute to his enormous contribution both to the local Polish community and as the founder of the Ethnic Communities Council in our region, which has become Hunter Multicultural Communities. John Gebhardt's daughter is now the CEO of that organisation. John spearheaded a dedicated focus on delivering adequate services and support to refugees settling in the region, and he fought really hard on issues of education, aged-care services and community development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take some time to acknowledge Victor Lupish, another Novocastrian who arrived on one of those first ships coming into Newcastle in 1949. Victor is a life member of Hunter Multicultural Communities and played a vital role in ensuring that Greta migrant camp is a rich part of our history. There are so many people currently serving on the executive of the Polish Association in Newcastle that I would like to acknowledge, and I'm not going to have time to name them all today. Former president Janina Sulikowski has been an extraordinary influence in our region, as has the current president, Marek Bartczak. The community still runs a fabulous Polish school, and that's an important part of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate to meet with the Polish ambassador last year to talk about this milestone occasion. Whilst we're all focused on this today, there is great concern about what is happening now in Poland's neighbour Ukraine. Whilst we stand in solidarity with the Australian Ukrainian community at this difficult time, Australia should be looking to support, in every way we can, Poland in its efforts to build resilience and civil society in Ukraine. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're now well over two years into the pandemic. By the government's own rhetoric, by now we ought to be able to live in a world that is 'COVID normal', having left our caves and embraced the new world. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. Certainly, it is clear to me that during the pandemic a pattern of behaviour has emerged that has harmed our response and harmed our progress. The reality outside of these walls, in my own community in the electorate of Macarthur and in electorates around the country, is well short of normal. We have a Prime Minister who, at the beginning of the pandemic, was off to the footy. He couldn't manage the vaccine rollout and put some of our most vulnerable, particularly those in aged care but also other vulnerable people, at very high risk. We've had huge queues for testing. We've had a lack of response to staffing levels in our aged-care environment and in our hospitals around the country. We have a Prime Minister who, in spite of being requested to make sure we had supplies of rapid antigen tests available, did nothing of the sort. He really ignored the problem, and it was too little, too late. There has been a pattern of behaviour from this government and this Prime Minister that has harmed our response, harmed our economy and put those most vulnerable at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had the aged-care disaster, in which many very vulnerable people have lost their lives, yet we had a minister who was off to the cricket and a Prime Minister who didn't see it as a crisis until far, far too late. Unfortunately, there is a systemic problem here, and it will not be addressed by reading out shopping lists from the health minister or by complaining about the states but doing nothing to fix the problem. People are unsure, they're very worried about what is happening, yet we still have a government whose reaction is too little, too late. The Prime Minister would have everyone believe that everything is going well. That's his perspective, from Kirribilli House, but it's not the perspective that we see in my electorate. There are still supply chain issues, with shortages of even simple things, like aspirin. If you go to the supermarket now, there are control limits on how much aspirin you can buy, because of shortages. It's also true for more sophisticated medications. Tocilizumab, which has led our response for those with severe COVID but is also used for severe rheumatoid arthritis, is in very short supply. Its use is being limited because of the lack of supply. The government have mismanaged the pandemic. They've called the shots wrong. They blame other people. And issues in supply chains are affecting us around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us consider rapid antigen tests. It is absolutely ridiculous that we don't use rapid antigen tests in this parliament. Every other parliament around the country is using rapid antigen tests to screen people coming into parliament, yet we are doing nothing of the sort. I've written to the Speaker and to the President of the Senate about this. It is ridiculous that we are still relying on temperature testing for people coming into this parliament. We know that temperature testing is a very poor tool. The majority of people who catch COVID, particularly young people, do not have a fever, and yet we're relying on temperature screening in Parliament House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was apparent to me very early on—and I wrote to the Prime Minister about it—that rapid antigen tests could play a very important role in the ongoing management of the pandemic, not just in parliament but also in schools, major businesses, sporting events and functions around the country. We could reduce the restrictions if we used rapid antigen tests. Nothing has happened. Months after rapid antigen tests have become normalised in other countries, the government has failed to secure adequate supplies for our population. Residents of Macarthur face great difficulty even now in getting RATs. In fact, at times they are unable to get them at all. This is a direct result of the Prime Minister's failures and the failures of the coalition government to adequately manage the pandemic from the word go. The response from the Prime Minister has been, 'We're off to the footy; there's no problem,' then, 'I don't hold a hose,' and now 'I don't hold a RAT.' Aged care is a disaster, and the government has had no systemic response to fix the problems. Those opposite have been abrogating their responsibilities to the most vulnerable, and they should be damned for that.</span>

Eleven and a half million Australians are benefiting through tax relief because of the policies that this government has put in place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 95 per cent of Australians are protected with vaccines. I wish there were many more. I wish that it was 100 per cent, and I'm sure Dr Freelander does as well. As for those Australians—and they're allowed to do it—who were protesting in Canberra over the weekend and for many days before, they should all go out and get a jab, get two jabs, get three jabs—get that booster shot—to protect themselves and their families, loved ones and associates, and, perhaps just as importantly, to protect those strangers whose identities they will never ever know; they'd protect them as well. It's all well and good to protest and carry on—and I appreciate that they weren't just all antivaxxers—but, to that point, as I'm sure Dr Freelander will agree: some of our colleagues who are promoting that sort of stuff should take a good, long, hard look at themselves. Seriously! To those colleagues who—for the sake of a political photo-op or some sort of opportunity to get more likes on their social media—go out and address those crowds and whip up a maelstrom of malcontent: I think that's very, very sad.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the first week of this year, I had the opportunity, and I was so pleased that I did, to work with a leading Perth diagnostics firm to arrange 32.6 million rapid antigen test kits to come into Australia via 46 chartered flights. I thank Qantas for the work that they did in that regard, right up to the top—right up to the CEO, Alan Joyce. They went out of their way to make sure that those RAT kits came into Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 94 million telehealth consultations through Medicare for 16 million patients have been put in place. I appreciate this was not just a COVID response, but it's one of the many things that we are doing to address those health issues, some of which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Eight hundred and fifty-seven new medicines have been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since 2019. Again, it shows that this government is getting on with the job of addressing all the health issues, not just COVID. And there have been 1,400 additional nurse placements for the regions. That's so important. I come from regional Australia and I appreciate what has been done in the COVID response by good, ordinary, everyday country Australians, and I thank them—and all Australians—for doing what they've done to resist COVID.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I thank the member for Riverina for his forbearance, for us, as to the commotion on our side of the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November last year, the Prime Minister announced his desire to get out of people's lives. Now, the Prime Minister isn't known for following through on his promises to Australians, but I must hand it to him: in this case, he really delivered. Over the following months, as the omicron surge swept through the country, the Morrison government was a government in name only. During the most difficult time of this pandemic in Australia, the Prime Minister was absent once again. National supply chains collapsed; supermarket shelves were empty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Lilley, people were lining up in their cars for a PCR test before dawn at the Boondall entertainment centre, from 4 am. They drove from chemist to chemist in vain, looking for RAT kits. Retail workers copped daily abuse from frustrated shoppers. Families could not see their loved ones in aged care because of outbreaks in nursing homes, and aged-care nurses were burnt out and exhausted. While all this was happening, the Prime Minister's most valuable contribution to the public health crisis was to redefine 'close contact'—as if COVID was ruled by semantics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government claims that no-one could have known the challenges that a new variant would bring, but here is a list of people who in fact did know the challenges that a new variant would bring. The federal government's own health officials warned that widespread community transmission would see PCR testing sites overwhelmed and urged the federal government in February 2021 to adopt rapid antigen test kits to alleviate pressure on the system. Public health specialists briefed members of the federal government in August that PCR testing facilities would not be able to cope with rising case numbers. The Australian Medical Association warned senior executives in the federal health department in September 2021 of the need to develop a strategy to procure rapid antigen tests, as did the Doherty institute, which provided the federal government's own commissioned modelling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While health industry bodies, hospitals, epidemiologists, GPs, aged-care providers, unions, and state and territory premiers beseeched the federal government to provide more masks and PPE, to build capacity for testing and to launch public information campaigns, the Prime Minister buried his head in the warm Hawaiian sand. For this Prime Minister every problem is someone else's fault and every crisis is someone else's responsibility. The Prime Minister tipped international border quarantine onto the states. He blamed the vaccine 'strollout' on international supply shortages, although every other country in the OECD seemed to manage. He failed to procure enough RAT kits because he was too busy fixing the vaccine rollout. Instead of taking responsibility, he reportedly commandeered stock from business owners and from Queensland Rail. He lets members of his own party dog whistle to antivaxxers in the parliament and on social media, hiding behind freedom of speech so he can harvest a few preference votes. At every turn the Prime Minister has pitted the states against each other, politicised lockdowns and border closures and watched on with glee as the premiers, who were forced to make tough decisions, took the heat for his failings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister thinks it's time for the government to get out of Australians' lives, and I agree. It's time that this coalition government got out of Australians' lives. Call the election. Let Australians elect a government which is ready to lead and has the will and the plan to build a better future for our nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I bought last year N95 masks, RATs, face shields for my staff and extra masks for clients too. However, since the government has let it rip the cases have been so much higher than any of us anticipated. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I have spent nearly $2,000 on PPE in the last two months, which is a lot for a small business, and most of it hasn't even arrived yet. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">With all of the cancellations due to COVID we are also operating at a quarter of our usual capacity. We cannot pass these costs on to clients, as the far majority are NDIS or Medicare funded and they cannot afford additional costs outside of what their funding covers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to share that message because, when the Prime Minister says it's time to live with COVID and time for the government to get out of people's lives, this is what happens—vulnerable people suffer. I for one think that vulnerable Australians have suffered enough. It is time for the government to call the election so we can get on with a new government that can deliver for working-class Australians and people in need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  For the past two years state governments, with the assistance of the federal government, sadly, have imposed many regulations and restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures have eroded our freedoms, our human rights and our civil rights. Such infringements on our rights were introduced under the guise of public safety, but the oft-cited health advice on which they were allegedly based has never been held up for public scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">States have introduced draconian measures, such as border closures, without having the validity of such measures tested in court. Governments have prevented doctors from prescribing medicines that were safe and effective, with a long history of safe use. Governments have mandated and coerced Australians to undertake a medical procedure that does not have long-term safety data. Substances that people are forced to inject into their body out of fear of losing their job are produced by big pharma companies that are getting very rich off these mandates while bearing no responsibility for any of the harm their products may cause, thanks to an indemnity granted by the government. We already know some of the harmful effects but we don't know all of them, because there is no long-term safety data. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's always going to be a section of the Australian community that, for whatever reason, is hesitant or totally opposed to these provisionally approved inoculations. The mainstream media are kidding themselves when they seek to demonise all pro-freedom people with the antivaxxer slur. There were tens of thousands of protesters on the lawns of parliament on Saturday. They were not all antivaxxers. Most of them were actually fully inoculated—I'd say many of them—but they were antimandate. They were hardworking people. Many of them lost their jobs due to workplace vaccine mandates. They were opposed to the discriminatory measures that are locking ordinary Australians out of polite society as well—locked out of cafes, locked out of restaurants, locked out of theatres, locked out of sporting venues and even locked out of hospitals. They are sick of being forced to comply with measures that just make no sense. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state we have mask mandates. We have vaccine mandates in the form of 'no jab, no job' policies. We've even had borders closed to people who weren't vaccinated. But still the omicron variant crossed the border, from the vaccinated, and swept through the state. The vaccinated caught the disease, the vaccinated passed on the disease, the vaccinated went to hospital with the disease, and the vaccinated, sadly, died with the disease. Ordinary Australians look at this data and ask the obvious question: why are we still pretending that masks, QR codes, vaccinations, lockouts, lockdowns and discrimination can stop the spread? The mainstream media has failed to actually ask that question, but it is a question that we can ask and it should be asked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the pandemic transitions to the endemic phase, we need a royal commission to find out not only how we got into this situation but who is responsible. The devastating impacts of the pandemic response on millions of Australians cannot just be swept under the rug. To gloss over the rise of tyranny and authoritarianism in this country would only further embolden those who seek to coerce and control the Australian people. If we fail to examine how and why we were stripped of rights and freedoms, we will fail to learn the lessons of history and we will be doomed to repeat them at the next pandemic or the next opportunity to induce fear amongst the populace and then tyranny. That's why I have called for a royal commission or a similar commission of inquiry with sufficient powers to fully investigate the pandemic response from all levels of government—federal, state, local, Public Service institutions, departments and agencies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asking people who believe in freedom, who believe in human rights, who believe that wrong was done over the course of this pandemic, to get onboard with this. I've got a petition at georgechristensen.com.au/inquiry. I am calling for wide terms of reference in that, to include all aspects of the pandemic response that have eroded our freedoms, human rights and civil rights: lockdowns; border closures; mask mandates; vaccine efficacy and safety; vaccine passports; medical segregation and discrimination; transparency of medical advice; treatments and interference with GPs; misinformation and censorship; big tech and freedom-of-speech issues; quarantine facilities, rules and operations; restrictions on social gatherings, such as weddings and funerals; access to hospitals and services; international travel and return; school closures; regulation enforcement and police overreach; PCR and rapid antigen tests—all of these issues. I urge anyone who has suffered under any instance of government overreach in the pandemic response to head to the website and support my call for a royal commission into the pandemic.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  We have learnt a lot throughout this pandemic. One of the most important lessons is this: we can take nothing for granted—from our health to our loved ones, to our jobs, to a sensible political policy debate. Nothing is certain. Australians have learnt this. Unfortunately, the government still has failed to learn the lessons of this pandemic. It has no comprehensive plan for our future; none. It's a rite of passage for parents to say to their children, 'I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.' Although many are angry at this Prime Minister, I am in the disappointed camp. I went back to the first time I spoke in parliament about the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic presented to us. Two years ago, on 23 March 2020, I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… every Australian needs the Prime Minister to do well now. I want him and his team to be incredibly successful in battling this virus. Peoples' lives do rest on them making the right decision day after day after day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, like millions of Australians, my trust and hope that this Prime Minister and this government could provide the leadership that Australia needed were misplaced, because it was just a few months later that this Prime Minister and his government had dived into bed with Clive Palmer, in the High Court, funding $1 million of his court costs to try and tear down Western Australia's health measures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member for Dawson said that the various border and other state government health restrictions were not tested in court. Well, I remind those on the government benches, those that sit with the member for Dawson, that it was tested in court. It had the full support of the then Attorney-General, in testing this question. The government piled tens of thousands—hundreds of thousands—of taxpayer dollars into the campaign that Clive Palmer was running in the High Court. It was tested, and the side that the government chose to back lost. That was a fortunate thing, because it allowed state governments, who have been the real workhorses during this pandemic, to get on with the health measures that were needed to save lives and to save livelihoods. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can think about other things that this government have chosen not to prioritise during this pandemic—getting enough rapid antigen tests, finding a good distribution mechanism, dealing with the obvious challenges we're going to have around rolling out vaccinations for children and booster doses. But they did have enough time to take millions of dollars of Western Australia's taxpayer funds and tip them into car park rorts all across the east coast. That was a priority for them. Rapid antigen tests were not. If we think about where this government's failures have been most tragically demonstrated, they are in the aged-care sector. We know that in this year alone at least 622 aged-care residents have died of COVID-19. This is a sector in complete crisis, and the government's response has been abysmal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe, and Labor believes, that every Australian deserves to get quality care, whatever life you've led, whatever income is left in your bank balance once you retire. To get quality care, we need to support the people who work in this sector. Supporting aged-care workers and the workforce means listening to them. They have been coming to this building year after year, telling us about the challenges in this sector. They were here last year, talking to us about what it was like working with COVID. The government ignored their message. Now the government is sending in the Australian Defence Force—a crisis response because the government chose not to listen to a sector in crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A quarter of aged-care-worker shifts are currently not being filled. Residents' wounds aren't being tended to, and people are waiting for hours for food, water and basic care. We know that some 60 per cent of aged-care workers have not had their booster shots. We saw in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> today a report that some one-third of aged-care residents have not yet had a booster shot in Western Australia. This is happening at a time when we have COVID outbreaks at Coolibah Care in Mandurah, Brightwater's The Cove in Mandurah and Juniper's Cygnet in Bentley—and we know there are more to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank those who are standing up for aged-care workers not just in this place but across Australia—their unions who have been here week after week, telling us the aged-care workers' stories, standing up for them to make sure that those who are protecting the most vulnerable people in our aged-care sector get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I have to say that quite frequently the member for Macarthur and I are in furious agreement. That's because we're both paediatricians. We both understand the healthcare system, including the public healthcare system, and we both understand the difficulties that this country has faced with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is something that's happening not just here in Australia but right around the world. In this instance, unfortunately, I have to violently disagree with the member for Macarthur's private member's motion today. In fact, I find it quite astounding, as someone who sits on the National COVID-19 Health and Research Advisory Committee, that he put this particular motion in writing. The reason I say that is this: I understand the member for Macarthur knows how difficult the situation has been, globally, over the past two years; I'm disappointed because this is about Labor having to talk down the COVID response. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that in opposition it is important to pick out things you'd like to point out or highlight, and it is true that this has been an awfully difficult period in Australia's history. But, if we take a step back as a country and look at the leadership that the federal government, the Morrison government, has provided to Australia, it has been, quite simply, extraordinary. That leadership started from the get-go with an understanding that Australia as a country was going to have to learn to live with the virus. We knew that this was here to stay. This is a prime minister who had the maturity to realise this wasn't a short-term thing, that it wouldn't be over in two weeks, that there was going to be a very different approach in the weeks, months and years to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, I think the Prime Minister's leadership has clearly shown that he understands the balance between lives and livelihoods, that we need to get the balance right, that saving lives is absolutely essential—every life needs to be saved—but the impact of this COVID pandemic on livelihoods also needed to be given consideration. Unlike premiers, who are being assessed for their impact on healthcare outcomes, the federal government is being judged on both health and economic outcomes. With that in mind, we acted quickly and decisively. Throughout this pandemic, on critical issues we've acted responsively, flexibly and nimbly. That started with the closure of international borders. It moved through to the development of the national cabinet, which has brought all the state and territory leaders together with the federal government. There's been an enormous amount of work on expert committees. The member for Macarthur and I sit on one of these bipartisan expert committees, which enables all the experts in Australia to provide information and expert evidence to government. That's been incredibly important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest bugbears for Australia has been securing our supply chains. There's absolutely no doubt that there have been rolling critical issues with supply chains. That started right back in March 2020, when we as a country had issues with obtaining personal protective equipment. It's hard to remember now, but we had problems with masks. We were running out of masks. We've had problems with toilet paper. We've had problems with all sorts of things with regard to sovereign supply. The minister for health, under the guidance of the Prime Minister, had secured these supply chains by stepping up local manufacturing capability. And then there were the COVID PCR tests in April 2020. Again, it is hard to believe these things. We were moving at speed to respond with diligence and care to all of these things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently we moved to the vaccine rollout, which we have now delivered ahead of time, actually. In fact, I was in the media saying that I was hoping that we might have 'freedom day' by Melbourne Cup. In fact, we had freedom day well ahead of that. The vaccine rollout had difficulties—there is absolutely no doubt about that—but the government's hard work was able to deliver the outcomes that this country so vitally needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We move to rapid antigen tests. There is no doubt that the PCR testing for COVID was the gold standard for delta. We needed aggressive suppression because delta had a much higher mortality rate and had a different underlying set of data behind it. But, when you look at omicron, it's been more important to move to having access to rapid antigen testing. And there is no doubt that this government has moved very quickly, in a number of weeks, to rolling out RATs and to making sure the general community can have access. We've also made sure that the fringe benefits tax availability for businesses means that businesses can use them more readily, and we've made sure there's concessional card support for those who can least afford RATs. It is worth mentioning that this government has provided an excellent outcome for Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">in complete crisis … my view—and the data supports it—is that the sector is performing and has performed exceptionally well in the work that it's doing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there's any quote that sums up the incompetence of this government, the criminal incompetence of this government, it is the quote from the minister for aged care services, Senator Colbeck, made only a couple of weeks ago, after he came back from going to the cricket: 'The system is performing exceptionally well.' Well, 681 Australians have died in aged-care homes since 1 January this year. This is the government's view of a system performing exceptionally well—681 souls taken because of the incompetence of this government. That's what this government says is a system working well. That is what the member for Higgins presumably means when she says 'living with the virus'. These 681 Australians are no longer living with this virus. It's tragic not just due to the impact on those individuals but due to families having lost loved ones because of the incompetence of this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This incompetence has been on display for the last eight years but has been well and truly elevated to a new level by the COVID crisis. This is because in aged care there is nowhere to hide. This Prime Minister is the master of buck-passing, of blame-shifting. He will blame anyone he can for his own failures. In aged care he can't blame the states because aged care is purely a responsibility of the Commonwealth government. It's purely under the responsibility of the Commonwealth government that 681 Australians have died in aged-care homes since 1 January this year. One-quarter of shifts have been unfilled, and there are not enough boosters for both the workforce and residents of aged-care facilities. There is a sad lack of PPE, and there are very few rapid antigen tests to be found. This is all to be laid at the feet of the Commonwealth government, a government that has failed every single Australian in aged-care facilities and their families. They have failed every single senior Australian who can't get a meal, who can't get a shower, who can't find someone to take them to the toilet—and Australians know it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At street stalls what I'm most often pulled up about is what's happening in aged care. I had a street stall outside the butcher's at Blacksmiths a few weeks ago and I had a couple come up to me to have a chat. The mothers of both the husband and wife were in separate aged-care facilities around the Lake Macquarie area. Both of them expressed huge frustration that they couldn't see their mums. They were worried about the treatment their mums were getting and they were worried that the staff of the aged-care facilities weren't getting enough support to look after their mums and all the other mums and dads in those facilities. The truth is that in this entire COVID crisis this government has been late, late, late. They failed on the national quarantine system, and that's why we had the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> disaster that spread to aged-care facilities in Sydney in 2020. They were dreadfully late in providing vaccines—it wasn't a race, according to the Prime Minister. Again, they're displaying an arrogance completely unrelated to ability. They ignored the inevitable crisis when they opened up the economy and did not secure enough rapid antigen tests. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this was foreseeable. All of this was predicted by experts. The Prime Minister likes to say everyone's exercising 20/20 hindsight, but the truth is that people were warning us about every single one of these issues at the time. What's particularly tragic for the aged-care system is that the system was broken before the COVID pandemic began. The system was broken. You only need to look at the aged-care royal commission findings to see that the title of the entire review—<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eglect</span>—sums up this sector. This government urgently needed to take action in the aged-care sector before the COVID pandemic hit. They failed to do that, and what's worse is that they piled on more of their incompetence in responding to the COVID crisis. What's the result of this neglect? It's that 681 Australians have been taken before their time, this year alone, in the aged-care sector. This motion is really important. The ignorance of the government is shown in claiming that all is going perfectly and the system is performing exceptionally well, and that demonstrates how out of touch they are with the lived experience of every other Australian. </span>

He's somebody who's spent his life making sure Australian kids get the best start in life. As a paediatrician for over 37 years, the member for Macarthur knows a thing or two about keeping people healthy, so I thank the member for Macarthur for moving this important motion that recognises the significant impact that COVID-19 continues to have on the day-to-day lives of ordinary Australians. It also recognises that the Morrison government has demonstrably failed in preparing the nation for these COVID-19 times. I know the impact that COVID-19 is having on people in Moreton, and what's become clear to me is that the pummelling isn't being felt evenly across my communities. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all been let down by the Morrison government's failure to prepare, failure to plan and rabid failure to take responsibility. But for some people these failures have had huge impacts on their lives, especially those in multigenerational households. If you're unable to isolate, everyone under the same roof will get sick. Casual workers who get sick or need to isolate have no income to buy food for their families, and when they get better they can't access a rapid antigen test to ascertain if they can return to work safely. It's been especially hard for single parents. Some permanent employees who've been infected have had no leave available and have had to take time off to recover with no pay. Many people were not eligible to get a pandemic leave disaster payment. Older people have found it really tough. Many are too afraid to leave their houses. They're staying at home, not helping local businesses, in terms of spending, not getting any exercise and getting lonelier day by day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was in a good place to prepare for this pandemic. Our island nation is isolated from the world. That bought us time, but the precious preparation time gifted to us by our geography was wasted by the coalition government. The Morrison government didn't properly prepare. They didn't adequately plan, and they fobbed off every responsibility they could, firstly, to the states and territories and, secondly, to everyday Australians. We should have had access to vaccines earlier, but the Morrison government didn't properly plan and didn't pick up the phone. Australians should have had access to rapid antigen tests—so that businesses could continue to operate, so that truck drivers could deliver food to shops and so that families could visit loved ones safely—but that didn't happen, because the Morrison government again failed to plan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has made an art form of ignoring good advice provided by experts, and many of our most vulnerable older Australians have been locked in their rooms in aged-care facilities. They're soiled and desperate, and many of them are infected with COVID-19. It is a horror show. Hundreds have died—our parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, neighbours and loved family members. Just this year—and it's only February; it's Valentine's Day—681 older Australians have already died from COVID-19 in aged care. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services been doing while aged-care facilities have been in crisis? He went to the cricket—not for a day, but for three days. This is the minister who said in early February that the aged-care sector was doing 'extremely well'. What is he smoking? Just last week we had 1,700 Australian Defence Force personnel launched into the aged-care sector. That's a full-blown Cyclone Tracy meets Cyclone Yasi-type crisis. Six hundred and eighty-one Australians are dead. The Leading Age Services Australia CEO, Sean Rooney, said last week: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;">there is no doubt that there would have been fewer cases and fewer deaths if we had had enough RATs for daily screening of everyone, access to PCR tests where needed, access to surge workforce as promised and reliable access</span><span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;"> to PPE.</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission into aged care's report, released just two years ago, was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. What would they call it today? Maybe their next report should be called '<span style="font-style:italic;">Disgrace</span>'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locals are confused about pandemic information, with no communication from the government about the virus and what to do if you catch it, about vaccinations and boosters and about rapid antigen tests and where to get them. The void has been filled with misinformation and conspiracy theories on social media and in our mainstream media. It's not just the failure of the Morrison government to keep Australians informed during this very difficult time; as the Prime Minister will know, members of his government are actively undermining our health workers by spreading and encouraging dangerous misinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic and making money from it. If the Prime Minister stands by and does nothing, he is condoning this behaviour. Less ukulele, more whip!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  The priority of any government is the cultivation and preservation of lives and livelihoods. There are few programs that truly embody this ethos more effectively than this government's Road Safety Program, with the corresponding $3 billion in record investment that has been placed towards it. I don't think it matters which side of the floor you sit on; we can agree that this investment is a worthy and necessary investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been said many times in this place—certainly many times by me, in my former role as chair of the Joint Select Committee on Road Safety—that even one death on our roads is one death too many. Previously, in my life as a police officer I personally attended many scenes of traffic fatalities and serious injuries, and I know firsthand the devastating effect that they have on not just those who are involved in the accidents but also the families and loved ones as well as the long-lasting effects on the first responders. Can I just thank all the first responders, current and former, for the work they have done and continue to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that the responsibility for road safety advice lies not only with all levels of government but with each of us individually. We all need to take responsibility for our driving and for monitoring conditions. Those small decisions that we make every day on the roads have the potential to directly and significantly impact the lives of many, many others. Surprisingly and unfortunately, during COVID, with fewer people on the roads—fewer people driving—the incidence of death and serious injury on our roads didn't decline; in fact, it increased despite that expectation. Whether that sad fact is because drivers didn't make better choices or whether the quieter roads gave them the opportunity for increased speed and complacency, one might be forgiven for saying that every year we have a pandemic on our roads. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago, over 1,188 people lost their lives on Australian roads. The majority of those were in regional Australia. In my electorate, statistically, we have five times the rate of fatalities when compared with metropolitan counterparts. In this country, 55 per cent of all fatalities occur on regional roads, despite having significantly lower populations. These are statistics that the government is taking seriously, and it is investing in lives by increasing investment in road infrastructure and ensuring the effective monitoring of conditions. I should note that the monitoring is meaningfully achieved through the proviso that, to receive funding under the Road Safety Program, states and territories are required to provide road safety data and to report against road safety metrics. Through the continued statistical analysis gained from evolving initiatives, we know the infrastructure improvements that actually work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the provision of life-saving measures in and of themselves are their own reward, as a member of parliament for the last three years I've also seen the direct positive impact on the community and on job opportunities that addressing and improving dangerous areas has created. Investment in infrastructure projects provides consistent opportunities in my electorate of Cowper for its residents to find gainful employment via councils and private contractors alike. In fact, it's expected to support around 13,500 jobs across the country, with the bulk of works being completed in regional areas, which I know will be welcomed by many. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's record $110 billion 10-year infrastructure pipeline will support and secure jobs, drive growth and help rebuild Australia's economy from the COVID-19 pandemic and meet our national freight challenge in getting Australians home sooner and more safely. Regardless of what happens in May, I know that we agree that we need a bipartisan approach, both sides, so all our people can return home safely.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  It's Valentine's Day today, and one thing's for sure: I have a whole lot of love for the people of Gilmore. Since coming to office in 2019, I have proudly delivered over $1.6 billion in community infrastructure and roads projects right across Gilmore, in the local government areas of Kiama, the Shoalhaven and Eurobodalla—from Minnamurra in the north to Tuross Head in the south, to my home town of Nowra and the bay and basin to Ulladulla. These community and roads projects are ones that I have actively advocated, with many discussions with community groups, associations and advocates, and, of course, I have taken up the fight for these projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the Nowra Bridge project—$155 million in federal funding for this important new bridge across the Shoalhaven River at Nowra. The Nowra Bridge is set to be across the river by the middle part of this year. So far, 1,900 workers have worked on the bridge, over more than 700,000 work hours. It's a huge boost for jobs and local spending, with 120 workers on site each day. The new Nowra Bridge is set open in the middle of 2024, depending on the weather.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all the workers on this very necessary project. I want to thank locals who have put up with some pretty horrendous traffic conditions during construction of the new Nowra Bridge. But I have been very vocal in saying that the government needs to do much more. I said at the Nowra Bridge official sod turning that we have to get on with the Nowra bypass. Quite honestly, I am dumbfounded that no elected representative before me—and there have been a lot of Liberal ones—has done anything about a Nowra bypass. Sure, they like to talk big on roads, but, when it comes to doing it, their complete failure to do anything about the Nowra bypass has been one of the biggest abrogations of responsibility there could be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is the Nowra bypass a New South Wales government priority? No, it's not. In fact, the New South Wales government's Illawarra-Shoalhaven Regional Transport Plan doesn't even include the Nowra bypass. The local council, Shoalhaven City Council, wanted it included, but it wasn't. Forgive me, but the New South Wales government has completely failed on the Nowra bypass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, it doesn't matter where you live on the coast—whether it's at Tuross Head, Gerringong, Milton or Bomaderry—one thing is for certain: if you want to go north or south through Nowra, there is only one river crossing, the Nowra Bridge. Ask residents of Nowra, North Nowra and Bomaderry what they think of the bottlenecks and of travelling at a snail's pace to get to their place of work or to school or even to get around on weekends. Locals have certainly told me. Since launching my petition I have received thousands of responses from people, and the stories of frustration with the traffic and the need for the bypass are compelling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Summer bushfires taught us many things, including that egress along our highway is paramount. We saw and felt what happened when the Princes Highway was cut off during the bushfires: how our one-road-in and one-road-out communities were cut off from access, power and communications; how tourists were stranded on our highway and camped in their cars as, thanks to the love and support of locals, they were brought food and supplies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When councils consider development applications good road access to properties is a condition, but our entire community on the New South Wales South Coast has a massive access problem. There is only one way north and south through Nowra, and that is over the Nowra Bridge. If the Black Summer bushfires have taught us one thing, it's that we have to be ready for the next disaster. We have to be ready and able to get people out by providing safe egress, and we have to provide safe access for our emergency services workers and volunteers. That's why the New South Wales government must make the Nowra bypass a priority. That's why the Nowra bypass must be included in the Illawarra-Shoalhaven Regional Transport Plan. Make no mistake: without it, Bomaderry and Nowra will turn into the next Albion Park bottleneck, which routinely saw traffic backed up for over five kilometres in the summer months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For over 40 years, the bypass has been mentioned. Since 1986, land has been earmarked for the Nowra bypass. It's beyond time to get on with the Nowra bypass. My message to the New South Wales government: make the Nowra bypass a priority. Include it in the Illawarra-Shoalhaven Regional Transport Plan. Start the preplanning for the Nowra bypass now.</span>

                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  It's with great pleasure that I join today's debate, and I acknowledge the member for Gilmore as representing the second most beautiful electorate in Australia—just behind Gippsland! It's great to have you here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no surprise to see that the speakers on this particular motion are predominantly from regional communities, because regional MPs understand better than most the critical importance of good road networks. Roads are the arterial life of our regional communities, the critical component making sure we can stay connected, whether it's for freight or to stay connected with our families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member who just spoke reflected briefly on the impact of the Black Summer bushfires and what they exposed as the frailty of our road network when it comes to natural disasters. In Gippsland, the Princes Highway and several major roads linking coastal communities were badly exposed for being poorly maintained, in terms of vegetation. We spent several weeks in which communities were cut off or relying on the Australian Defence Force to deliver the most basic supplies. We have to change our approach to maintaining the resilience of the road network to ensure that our communities can stay connected even in the face of natural disasters. What we saw post bushfires on the Princes Highway was a major tree-clearing exercise, which locals reflected on quite dryly as, 'It's about time.' They had been calling for it for decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do appreciate the opportunity to speak in relation to the Road Safety Program. As the member for Riverina, who initiated this program, often reflected, too many people are killed and injured on our rural and regional roads. In fact, a disproportionate number of people continue to be killed and injured on rural and regional roads. From memory, in my time as the minister for transport, I think it was something in excess of 50 per cent of road trauma that occurred on rural and regional roads. Given the higher speeds often involved, the chances of someone being killed or injured are much higher in a crash on those rural and regional roads in comparison to the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the former minister and now a humble backbencher—or not so humble, as the member for Hunter is probably reflecting—I don't accept that we have to have any road trauma on our roads. We as a government have signed up to the safe system approach: safer drivers, safer vehicles and safer speeds on safer roads. The safe system approach is designed to ensure that no crashes need to occur in the future, as we move towards zero road trauma. I fear, though, that governments at the state and federal levels are often guilty of focusing on the driver component of the safe system. It's far easier to blame the drivers than to accept responsibility for the lack of investment in infrastructure in the road network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for us is to work constructively, in partnership with local and state governments, to deliver the types of roads that our rural and regional communities expect. That's why the Road Safety Program, brought forward by the member for Riverina when he was the minister and continued by the member for New England in that role, is so important. It's important because it has a 'use it or lose it' component. The 'use it or lose it' component is of great importance for this particular program because it forces the state governments to develop a sense of urgency about getting the job done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I've seen in my electorate of Gippsland—over the past three years, in particular—is a recalcitrant state government unwilling to work in a constructive way to deliver the projects that have been funded by the federal government. The federal government doesn't actually build the roads; the federal government goes into partnership with the state government to deliver projects. What I've seen in Gippsland is tens of millions of dollars allocated in the 2019 election still being held by Treasury, not ending up with black stuff on the roads in Gippsland. It's to the eternal shame of the Victorian state government that they haven't been able to reach an agreement to secure projects that would deliver road safety improvements in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast has been the Road Safety Program. The moment there was a 'use it or lose it' component to it, the Victorian state government suddenly found the capacity to improve road shoulders, to improve sight lines, to install roadside safety barriers, where appropriate, and to roll that program out in an expeditious way to improve road safety in the Gippsland electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm calling on the Victorian government to be a better partner when it comes to delivering road infrastructure safety improvements in Gippsland. I'm calling on the Victorian state government to develop a greater sense of urgency and reach agreement with the Commonwealth on money that is already there. The federal government often pays up to 80 per cent of the funding for road projects in Victoria—up to 80 per cent. The state government only has to find 20 per cent to get these much-needed projects rolling out across my community. Perhaps it will take a 'use it or lose it' approach from the current federal transport minister to try and force this state government to get onboard and deliver the road safety improvements that we deserve in our regional communities. Too many people are being killed and injured on roads that could be fixed. The money is available to fix them. We just need the state government to demonstrate the capacity to get on with the job.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RAMSEY:</span>
                  </a>  As I was saying, over $1 billion in total for road infrastructure in the electorate of Grey is coming from the federal government. It's phenomenal. From this particular program, we've seen shoulder sealing, audio tactile line marking on centre-lines, kerb widening and surface improvements on the Eyre Highway, the Augusta Highway, the Barrier Highway, the Stuart Highway and the Upper Yorke Road—thousands of kilometres of roadway. We've seen a complete upgrade of the Upper Yorke Road between Maitland and Arthurton. I rated it as the roughest bitumen road in the whole electorate of Grey, so I'm very pleased to see that. We've seen shoulder sealing and surface treatment on the Todd Highway. The Todd Highway runs down the centre of Eyre Peninsula. It's what we called a 'mirror knocker': as the road got narrower, as the trailers of the semitrailers dropped off the edge and broke down the bitumen, it got to the stage where the road train drivers were clipping mirrors as they were going down the road. That was definitely not a good outcome. That road has now been reshouldered all the way through to Kynecutter. So that's been an absolute improvement for road safety. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same thing for the Birdseye Highway, which cuts across from Lock to Cowell. With the establishment of T-Ports on the Eyre Peninsula, which is a barging operation that ships grain—I believe they took over 600,000 tonnes this year—we've seen a complete redirection in the way grain is moved on the Eyre Peninsula. With the closure of the railways, some people said, 'How will we get our grain to port?' Well, we've actually shifted the port for many growers for the moment. Things change, times change and we need to adapt. So the upgrading of the highways has been very important to my electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen money go towards the Middleton to Maitland road. It's the same as the Arthurton to Maitland road; it just runs through town. After my 14 years in parliament, it's so gratifying to see this road being upgraded. I can remember a time when we had a different regime in South Australia. I managed to secure some federal funds, but I couldn't convince the Premier at the time, Jay Weatherill, to take the federal funds because they were required to put up 20 per cent and they thought it would so badly affect their GST receipts that they couldn't bring themselves to do it. I've got to say that the advent of the Marshall government has been an absolute revelation. We've now got a state government that is keen to do works outside the capital city and a federal government that is keen to invest in them; hence, as I said, we've got the $1 billion for this particular program and the $82 million coming back into Grey. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a considerable amount of work going on with the Horrocks Highway. For those who don't know South Australia well, it runs from about the middle of the Flinders Ranges at Wilmington right down to Gawler. It runs through the beautiful Clare Valley. In running through the Clare Valley, it is a big commuter route—a tourist route, if you like. That road had become very bumpy. It's winding and quite narrow in places and, without a doubt, dangerous. While work is not yet complete there, we're certainly getting on with the job. We're down south of Auburn now. That's making a considerable difference. We've come all the way from Wilmington to Auburn with that significant upgrade, and we're continuing that work. It has been warmly met on the ground. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Stuart Highway has been in the press a bit lately. It's been cut off for about a fortnight due to floodwaters at Glendambo, which has resulted in the isolation of Coober Pedy. Thank you very much to Senator Bridget McKenzie for bringing the national disaster relief funding arrangements into operation and to the rest of the federal cabinet in making the RAAF available to do those food drops into Coober Pedy. With the railways cut, at the moment, the Stuart Highway is one of the essential feeders through to northern Australia. It's good that it's open again now and it's good that we're spending extra money on making that roadway safer—the same thing: putting the shoulders out, putting the tactile markers down the middle to keep sleepy drivers awake and to keep people safer on the roads. There is a lot of traffic going on in northern South Australia. It is the economic future of our state, in many ways. We'll see more big copper finds up there—BHP are on the trail at the moment—and the roads need to be in a suitable state to deal with those loads.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  In December last year I presented the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Innovation, Science and Resources entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The now frontier: developing Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> space i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ndustry</span>. On 11 November 2020 the committee adopted an inquiry into developing Australia's space industry and was asked to focus on how the Australian government can support and encourage the space industry while preserving and protecting the space environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Space is an industry that inspires, fascinates and excites people. Generally, rockets and astronauts come to mind when we think about the space industry, but, in fact, it's technology and equipment that are very much part of our day-to-day lives. There are enormous opportunities for individuals, organisations and communities to take advantage of this growing sector, particularly in regional and rural areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians are familiar with our nation's involvement in the moon landing in 1969—a little bit before my time—and the tracking stations at Honeysuckle Creek and Parkes, in New South Wales, that relayed images back to earth of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon. This followed the rocket-testing program in the late fifties at Woomera, in South Australia, as part of the Australian government's Weapons Research Establishment. But perhaps less familiar to Australians is the continued use of space based technologies and applications in our daily lives. Mobile phones, the internet, weather forecasting, GPS technology and banking services all rely on data derived from space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Space related technologies—robots, drones, remote sensors and artificial intelligence—were once considered those of the future but are now very much where we are. For Australia to be competitive, we need to not only foster these technologies and their applications but ensure that we have the right people, with the right skills and expertise, to make it happen. Australia needs to position itself—it must position itself—to capitalise on these opportunities. Australia enjoys natural and structured advantages that can be leveraged to benefit us socially and economically. Our geography and landscape, education and training systems, technical expertise and international partnerships and agreements all combine to form an important foundation for access to the global space industry supply chain and the development of sustainable commercial activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has set a goal to grow the domestic space sector by $12 billion and create an additional 20,000 jobs. The report presented last year makes recommendations designed to support this growth and beyond. Some of these recommendations include the call for an overarching vision of the industry in Australia, to inspire confidence and investment in our space capabilities and give an increased visibility of space across the government and parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, space is an accessible industry to those wishing to pursue a career in this field. The sector presents many opportunities for young Australians, and the need to grow a workforce to support it is paramount. There are a range of professions not generally associated with the space industry, such as law, medicine, project management, communications and business, that will be able to support and facilitate Australia's industry to grow to an internationally competitive sector. Further, there is so much potential for our rural and regional areas to benefit from and get involved in Australia's space sector. This includes the links between our regional industries and the space sector; the application of space related technology and infrastructure to agriculture, health and telecommunications; and, of course, the uptake of regional education and training to better equip young people to build their careers in the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an exciting time for the Australian space industry, with awe-inspiring work already being done here. In terms of growing the future workforce, the report tabled in December identified the need for greater education of young people in science, technology, engineering and maths. We had evidence that most of the higher level jobs are filled by those who have been educated overseas. We need to make a change in that regard and encourage education at a university level in both space engineering and aeronautical engineering, rather than look overseas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  Firstly, I would like to extend my belated congratulations to Mr Enrico Palermo, who became the head of the Australian Space Agency last year. Mr Palermo has a decorated career in physics and mechanical engineering, having spent over 14 years at Virgin Galactic at the time of his departure as both Chief Operating Officer of Virgin Galactic and President of the Spaceship Company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to space exploration and space industry I am fortunate to represent the electorate of Bean. We are home to the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex, which is one of only three deep space network stations around the world. Its dishes are a remarkable sight to see against the beautiful backdrop of Tidbinbilla and, in true Australian fashion, there are cattle around its base. Just as its predecessor at Honeysuckle Creek played a critical role in the first moon landing, with footage of that first giant step coming from Bean, the CDSCC has played critical support roles in the Apollo space missions to the moon, the Skylab space station and the early flights of the space shuttle. It has been involved in hundreds of other missions since its establishment in 1965 and today is providing vital around-the-clock contact with more than 30 spacecraft on deep space missions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The deep space complex, together with other critical space infrastructure across Australia, is a tribute to our skills and expertise in the space industry and what we can achieve. Bean is also home to the ANU Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, including the Mount Stromlo Observatory, and EOS's satellite laser ranging facility, which is also based at Mount Stromlo. This region has decades of experience in satellite technology. We can build on our proud legacy. It makes sense for this region to be one of the hubs of such activity. We continue to have the science, technology, infrastructure and skills to punch significantly above our weight in the global space industry, but it's critical that we make the investment in TAFE and university places that will underpin this industry for decades to come. Only a Labor government will do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only does the space industry have value and importance for space exploration; space based applications impact our everyday lives and are particularly important for Australia. For example, supermarkets use satellite navigation in their delivery fleets, autonomous and driverless vehicles rely on satellite navigation enhancements, emergency and disaster relief responses rely on specialised satellite imagery, and adaptation to climate change relies on space data. The pace at which space based technologies and innovation are developing is set to revolutionise the way we live. Increasingly it's where money is being made, where jobs are being created and where industry is being undertaken, and it is expected to grow exponentially. Estimates of its global value into the 2040s range between $1 trillion and $3 trillion, and data shows that for every dollar invested there is a direct return of between $2 and $10. It's a tremendous opportunity for Australia going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have been calling to expand Australia's space industry for many years. We sought an Australian space science and industry agency to ensure that we did not miss out on the opportunities a space industry provides. We understand its capacity to create thousands of new high-skill, high-wage jobs in advanced manufacturing, research, earth observation and space technologies, but, additionally, a range of professions are needed to support that industry, creating new jobs in law, medicine, project management, communications and business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, Australia ranks 18th among the G20 countries for government investment in space as a percentage of GDP. Globally, it's about one to 1.5 per cent of the global effort. It's clear we need to capture a bigger slice of the space market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomed the establishment of the Australian Space Agency in 2018, and I'd like to acknowledge the importance of the agency and the role it has played in strengthening the industry. As someone who worked closely with the engineers and scientists in the sector, I say that funding announcements, while welcome, need to be backed up with clear plans for such investment, and, critically, this needs to include an investment in skills. Let's hope that these are the first steps in what will become a giant leap for Australia's space industry.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  In the heart of my electorate of Adelaide, on the former Royal Adelaide Hospital site, a real industry transformation is happening, and what's known as Lot Fourteen has become the national hub for the space industry in Australia. It is home to the Australian Space Agency, Australian Space Discovery Centre, Mission Control Centre and SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre. It is also home to over 90 private companies, research and educational institutions and government departments in this sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an industry that has enormous potential to generate much-needed local manufacturing and high-tech jobs for SA and beyond. The target in Australia is to triple the size of the space sector to $12 billion by 2030. In addition, it is estimated that around 1.4 million companies across Australia will benefit from the growth of the space industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adelaide company Fleet Space Technologies, also based at Lot Fourteen, is a perfect example. Fleet, run by its amazing CEO, Flavia Tata Nardini, has grown from three staff in 2015 to about a hundred today. It made history in 2018 when it launched the country's first commercial nanosatellites into low earth orbit. Since then, it's gone from strength to strength. Fleet is now planning to build a satellite hyperfactory at the Australian Space Park at Adelaide Airport. It will be the nation's first dedicated space manufacturing hub once it is completed. And now Fleet has opened its first office in Houston and is partnering with NASA to put the first woman on the moon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the sector growing by around 50 per cent over the past 10 years, companies such as Fleet will need a whole generation of highly skilled technicians, mathematicians, engineers, physicists, chemists et cetera, and this will be South Australia's—and, indeed, Australia's—great opportunity and challenge. We need to ensure that we are training people locally to fill these jobs locally. That starts in the very, very early years. So, in addition to ensuring that our universities and TAFEs are responsive to the growing demands of this industry, we need to inspire children, from their earliest years, to see the beauty and potential of STEM subjects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Andy Thomas Space Foundation, launched in November 2020, will also play an important role in this, and I'd like to acknowledge its CEO, Nicola Sasanelli. The foundation, also based at Lot Fourteen in my electorate, will be an interface between the space industry and the wider Australian community. It will support education and training from primary to tertiary levels and promote career opportunities in this expanding sector. The Australian Space Discovery Centre, also based at Lot Fourteen, will play an additional role in sparking young people's imaginations through school programs and other learning initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, too, take this opportunity to congratulate the new head of the Australian Space Agency, Mr Enrico Palermo, on his appointment. He brings a great deal of industry and corporate experience, which can only benefit this industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to congratulate all the companies, agencies and investors who have believed in Adelaide and South Australia. It is thanks to these people that we are starting to see the much-needed return of manufacturing and technology in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to pay my respects to the former South Australian Labor government, under the leadership of Jay Weatherill, whose foresight at the time—and I remember having discussions with him and him saying how important this industry was—was the catalyst for this expansion of the industry that we are witnessing today. It was that state Labor government under Jay Weatherill's leadership that established Australia's first dedicated space office in Adelaide in 2015. Without this foresight, we certainly wouldn't be where we are today, reaching for the stars.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I rise to congratulate the Australian Winter Olympic Games team on their fantastic achievements in Beijing to date. The Olympics aren't over yet, but from an Australian perspective they've already had the most successful winter games ever. I congratulate Jakara Anthony, Scotty James, Jackie Narracott and Tess Coady, who have been among the medallists. We still have seven days to go. There are amazing athletes still competing, including Warringah's very own Sami Kennedy-Sim, who is competing in her third Olympic Games. I wish Sami the best of luck in the women's ski cross on Thursday. She has overcome great adversity, including injuries and a stroke in 2013. She is a proud ambassador of the national Stroke Foundation. She raises awareness of strokes in young people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian winter Olympic team has come a long way since I first competed as a 17-year-old in Albertville in 1992. The team has nearly doubled in size and now more than half of the team are women. I congratulate all the athletes for making it to the Olympic Games. I wish the athletes the best of luck for the events still to come. I remind people that, by supporting the Australian team overseas, you are supporting Australians who are doing their very best. They really should make us all feel very proud. Whether it's summer or winter Olympics, they do need support. I remind the government that funding of sport is essential for that message of health and wellbeing to our communities.</span>

That's why I'm so proud that I have delivered one of Australia's first Head to Health clinics, a mental health clinic in my community in Penrith. I want people to have the highest quality care and support when they need it most. I worked really hard for that $14 million investment.

It was a real collaboration, bringing the needs and real-life experiences together to create something that will make a difference to people's lives. The centre can be contacted through the Head to Health phone line on 1800595212. It's open, as I said, 365 days a year.</span>

It's becoming a joke, not a funny one, because this incompetence is hurting the people I represent here and fight for in this place. We're entering the third year of the pandemic and we're watching the way other countries are navigating ahead of us and still not once did it occur to the Prime Minister that he should focus less on marketing himself and more on rolling out the vaccine smoothly. Not once did it occur to the Prime Minister that he should ensure that there were plenty of rapid antigen tests available as we began to open up, so people could use them as a tool, not to protect themselves but to protect their families, workmates and communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unsurprisingly, the Prime Minister, who doesn't know how much a loaf of bread or a litre of petrol is, didn't think he needed to provide rapid antigen tests for free. Why? Because he doesn't understand how much the ever-rising cost of living is weighing down on Australians. He thinks that spending up to $2 a litre for petrol to drive around looking for rapid antigen tests, at $25 a pop, is something everyone should have the time and the money for. He's out of touch and, hopefully, soon he'll be out of a job.</span>

Grant guidelines for the second phase of the $50 million National Soil Carbon Innovation Challenge have been released. Applications are open until 3 March.

Recently, with the member for Hume and Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, I visited YLAD Living Soils, in Hilltops shire. He used to represent it; I do now. It was an important meeting. Certainly, Bill and Rhonda Daly, who operate that farm—a farm that has been operated by Bill and his family for four generations—are working wonders with soil health. They're cutting costs with every method, absolutely lowering synthetic fertilisers, chemicals and pesticides and making the most of their soil. They're saving money because of it. They're making their farm more profitable, and that's what it's all about. They are doing what all farmers should be doing, and that is looking after your soil.</span>

I have been fortunate to be out in my community, helping organisations receive funding to do things that will make the Perth community even stronger. These include: the Friends of Coolbinia Bushland, who will be restoring some of the bushland that was damaged from a recent fire; Mount Hawthorn Primary School Parents and Citizens, with new instruments for their school band; Sexual Health Quarters in Northbridge, who provide sexual health and domestic violence prevention services, to improve wheelchair access for their facilities; OzHarvest, based in my electorate but serving the entirety of the Perth metropolitan area, which will be getting a new forklift to help their volunteers prepare food and get things out the door quicker; Green World Revolution, a new plastic recycling service, to help members of my community recycle plastic; and the Mount Lawley Bowling Club, so terribly treated through the sports rorts affair, which will be getting some new lawn bowls so that more people can participate in this fabulous sport. There are also security cameras for the Mount Lawley Inglewood Roos Junior Football Club, a new couch and feeding chair for the Maylands Playgroup, an oscillating edge sander and welding fume extractor for the Bassendean Men's Shed, new fencing for Cahoots and a new gazebo for Ellis House Community Art Centre.</span>

The Goomeri community joined police, SES and fire and rescue, risking their own lives searching for a 14-year-old, young Krystal Cain, after she and her father were swept away in a once-in-a-lifetime flood near Booubyjan, on the way to Krystal's grandmother's house.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When someone goes missing in a torrent 10 metres deep, in raging floods, it quickly becomes evident that it's not a search for a survivor. Survival and safety overrule normal workplace health and safety. You're exhausted and wet and you don't know what you will find, but you do what needs to be done. In the city, you often go years without knowing who your neighbours are. In the country, particularly in remote localities, relationships with neighbours are forged partly by necessity, in preparedness for times like this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of Wide Bay, I would like to recognise those brave and determined people who left their own families to venture into the flood affected territory to search for Krystal and those who looked after Krystal's father, Lenny, who suffered a heart attack while clinging to the tree with his daughter, before she was tragically swept away.</span>

Today I want to tell the parliament about Delacombe Park Cricket Club and one of the most special events that I have been privileged and proud to be a part of. It's described by the driver of the event, Bill Mallinson, as 'an event which sent waves through the club and community, an event that will be remembered for years to come as a significant day in the fight for recognition and opportunity for girls and women'. Delacombe cricket club has a girls team for the second time this year, and they want to have a women's team. They want to have a team for people with special abilities. They want to have a team for people who are vision impaired.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But their clubhouse and their culture reflected the history of men, and it didn't reflect the contributions of women and girls. Bill, Ash Hudson, Miranda Maling, the girls from the girls team, the women who are part of that club and the men from the first team came together, and on Saturday we officially opened the Women's Wall, where photographs of the first girls team, the coaches and the women who have run the canteen and been supporters were put up on that wall and everybody there was told, 'Girls and women can be whatever they want to be as long as they get the opportunity.' It was the most special event I've been to in a long time.</span>

We don't need a survey to say that we are the centre of the universe. We don't need a survey to tell us that the Sunshine Coast is dearly loved. But, alas, a survey we got. This is in fact a global survey, the Tourism Sentiment Index. The Sunshine Coast has been announced as the world's most-loved destination of 2021, as it should be. Indeed, this accolade doesn't come from applications. It doesn't come from lobbying. It comes from word of mouth worldwide. I tell you what: if that's what they're saying now, let's wait to see what they say in 10 years time, because, as home to the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, we will indeed be on the TV set for half the world's eyeballs. They love us now; they're going to love us even more in the future. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  It is disappointing that the Morrison government is failing to recognise that the aged-care sector is in complete crisis right now, and the lack of response and the lack of planning from both the minister and the Prime Minister is just not good enough. Of course, we want every elderly Australian to get high-quality care, and, to get that quality care, we need amazing people to support them. Unfortunately, at the moment, 60 per cent of aged-care workers haven't had their booster shot. At least 60,000 residents still haven't had their booster shot. The Prime Minister said it wasn't a race to get vaccines in arms, but it still is a race, and he has gone missing in action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A quarter of aged-care worker shifts are not being filled. Wounds aren't being tended to, and residents are not getting food and water. This is having real-life consequences. Of course, one of the consequences of not filling these shifts is that families remain separated. This is why Brenda, a resident from Seaford Rise, was separated from her mother, who was 95, unable to see and unable to hear. Their only communication is through touch. Yet, because of the staff shortages in aged care, Brenda was told she could not see her mother. She could not have that experience. Shame on this government!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  In October last year, I spoke in parliament about the shadow pandemic and the need to increase mental health services in our local communities. I've been engaging with local communities about the Head to Health program and my advocacy to see Head to Health satellite centres rolled out following last year's budget announcement of over $487 million for 40 Head to Health sites across the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One community in particular has been active in its support for my advocacy on this cause. Before travelling to Canberra for this sitting period, I received a petition with almost 3,000 signatures from the Limestone Coast community, asking for one of the 24 Head to Health satellite centres to be located in Mount Gambier. Last week I presented those signatures, along with letters of support from Limestone Coast community service providers, to the minister for health, Greg Hunt. The community has sent me a clear message: they want me to fight for a Head to Health site for Mount Gambier. I enjoy a good fight, so I'm looking forward to doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health is an issue that will impact everyone at one stage or another. Mount Gambier is South Australia's second-largest city and services the wider population of the Limestone Coast and the 'greater green triangle'. Giving this region the services required to tackle mental health issues when they arise will make for a happier, healthier Limestone Coast, and the flow-on benefits will be immeasurable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  The people of Blair have been paying 42 per cent more to visit a GP since the coalition government came to power, with a 67 per cent increase in out-of-pocket expenses for specialists as well. One of the biggest changes this government made was the Distribution Priority Area classification system that came in on 1 July 2019. Doctors are telling me it's much harder to get overseas trained doctors and bonded doctor access to Medicare, which means poorer health outcomes for my area. I've been on this case now for a number of years and I've been pushing it, along with local GPs, and I want to pay tribute to the work they've done—people like Dr Cathryn Hester and Dr Magdy El Ashrey. Dr Hester is at Karana Downs, at Colleges Crossing Family Practice. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to announce that a Labor government would make a difference here. If we get into government, an Albanese Labor government will make it easier for people across Ipswich, including in rural towns and the Karana Downs area, to see a GP. We will change the classification to make sure people can get access to GP services that are currently reserved for the bigger cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. We will make sure this is the case. I want to thank the shadow minister for health and my good friend the member for Oxley, for his advocacy, as well as local GPs. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met with both the current minister and the former minister, and I've written to them. And guess what? Their correspondence said they wouldn't change this until we got poorer health outcomes in my area. It's not good enough. Labor will make a difference. </span>

Today I want to acknowledge the Latrobe Council, which has been successful in its application under the program's last round. The iconic Australian Axeman's Hall of Fame in Latrobe celebrates the role that the timber industry and the sport of woodchopping have played in forging our nation's identity. This funding will create a display to commemorate the specific contribution made by Australian service personnel with connections to the forestry industry. This is something that hasn't been specifically honoured anywhere else in Australia thus far. </span>

This concert is his way of welcoming those refugees to our community and also thanking the ADF and the diplomats who have worked on this evacuation. The concert will be raising money, in particular, for educational supplies for Afghan students here in Canberra. Tickets are still available, though there are not many left so you'll need to get to it quickly. You can also support these refugees by donating vouchers to the Red Cross. I understand that the Canberra Centre has supported this community very generously by donating some vouchers. I want to thank Michael Rabey and the Rotary Club of Canberra, the Australian Red Cross and the Canberra Theatre Centre for putting on this fantastic event. </span>

Unfortunately, their goodwill and generosity have not been matched by the Australian government. These temporary protection visas are cruel and should be abolished. People should have a permanent means of becoming Australian residents because there is nothing temporary about the situation in Afghanistan. </span>

Unfortunately, for too long this alignment has been ignored by Western Australia's state government, despite the concept having been part of the Perth Metropolitan Regional Scheme since the 1990s. The current government has failed to build this vital infrastructure. Continued population growth in Perth's northern suburbs has compounded the traffic issues associated with this intersection and increased the demand for this much needed project to be completed. The Barnett Liberal government committed funding towards this project in 2016, only for the then replacement state Labor government to remove the funding and allocate it to other projects the following year. Now we're six years on and the traffic congestion at this intersection is substantially worse. Despite the WA Liberals committing $10 million at last year's state selection, disappointingly there's only been more silence from the state Labor government on this matter. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project simply needs to happen. It will reduce congestion, improve traffic flow and provide greater safety for road users. It will benefit the local governments of Wanneroo and Joondalup and, importantly, the residents of Wangara, Darch, Landsdale, Madeley and Pearsall. It requires a little bit of foresight and vision from the WA Labor government and a little bit of political will to get it done, but this project is a no-brainer. Delaying or ignoring the project would not be a viable option. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  Last Thursday morning I had the pleasure of participating in the launch of the Legacy Cup, an annual event as part of Legacy '23 in women's football. Not surprisingly, the former Matildas were the victors in the game of football, beating the parliamentary football team 6-4, so they hold the trophy. Even though I have it here, I'm holding it on behalf of Senator Nita Green who's on maternity leave. There were three senators involved in the match: Senator Watts, Senator Chisholm and Senator Canavan, all Queenslanders like me. We were joined by a couple of Matildas, including Ashleigh Sykes, but couldn't compete against their superior skills. Hosting the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023 is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to realise a truly meaningful legacy for football, which is what this is all about. It's an ambitious plan to ensure we deliver positive and enduring benefits for Australia's largest community sport beyond 2023.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The five pillars are participation, community facilities, leadership and development, tourism and international engagement, and high performance. We know that sport is important and that football is an inclusive platform that can deliver economic, health and social benefits to more Australians than ever before. As I finish I would like to go on the record to apologise to the Matildas that I played against. I've played a lot of rugby league and rugby union and did some bad slide tackles, so I do apologise. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  As the federal member for Wentworth, I often hear from young people in my electorate who feel disenchanted with the political process. They feel as though their voices are not being heard. I'm keen to fix this. I often say to people that the political system in Australia is only as good as we make it, and the level of engagement, particularly of young people, will materially determine the quality of our elected representatives and the quality of our decisions as well. That is why I am seeking the assistance of young people aged from 14 to 24, living or studying in my electorate of Wentworth, to help me build and to participate in the first Wentworth Youth Advisory Committee. It's my hope that this youth advisory committee will help raise the voices of young people from a variety of backgrounds, a variety of life experiences and a variety of political opinions, and those whose views are not as well represented in the political debate as they should be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of us who participated in the Raise Our Voice campaign know, when given the opportunity, young people are only too willing and enthusiastic to put their views forward and help shape the political debate, and I want to make sure that that's an ongoing part of my representation. So, if this sounds like you or someone you know, please encourage them or yourself to speak up and be heard. I'd like to know what issues are important to you as a young Australian. What issues would you like me to raise right here in parliament on your behalf? Please reach out to me and share your thoughts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Good, sufficient local infrastructure has never been more important for local jobs, for health and for our quality of life. Recent ABS data shows that by 2041 my electorate of Greenway will experience some of the highest rates of population growth in the entire state of New South Wales. We will experience a population increase of, for example, 72 per cent growth in Blacktown, 65 per cent growth in Acacia Gardens, and a 318 per cent growth in Riverstone, to name but a few suburbs. But with this population growth will come growing pains if we don't have sufficient infrastructure. Sue Hunter from the Riverstone and Schofields chamber of commerce has reached out to me, saying: 'We are bursting at the seams, and without a plan we are in serious trouble.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative that the roads we drive on, the parks our kids play at, the hospitals our most vulnerable attend and the mobile coverage we rely on every day are well equipped for this explosion in growth. That's why I'm dedicated to ensuring that we have the Rouse Hill Hospital emergency ward we need and deserve; provide local job opportunities through the relocation of the SBS to Western Sydney; provide better mobile coverage infrastructure locally, like in our local suburb, The Ponds; plan for TAFE, where we will skill up our local apprentices; and employ local people to build this critical infrastructure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that to build the Western Sydney of tomorrow we have to start planning today. This Liberal government has let Western Sydney down, time and again. Only Labor has a plan to do better by the people of Western Sydney.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I rise to update the parliament on a very important day for the young people of the Ryan electorate, and I talk not about St Valentine's Day but the fact that today we have a brand-new headspace centre opening its doors—a new, expanded centre. Headspace Taringa was one of the busiest centres in the country—the second-busiest in the whole nation, in fact—throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and demand for the support centre has skyrocketed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They had a fantastic team there, but the simple fact was that, because they had outgrown their facilities, they were faced with the problem of having to cut off their waiting list. They had a wait time of over eight weeks. Thanks to a $780,000 contribution that I secured from the federal government, headspace Taringa has now been able to relocate to a brand-new, much larger facility in Indooroopilly. It's far more fit for purpose not only for the staff but also for the numbers of young people who they need to service there. Those staff have worked tirelessly to keep up with the additional demand, and I know that the new larger facility will help them to reach even more young people in the Ryan electorate. Its doors are open today for young people to visit, and I encourage anybody who needs a hand to reach out to headspace Taringa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate Jamie and the whole team—now, headspace Indooroopilly; formerly, headspace Taringa. I can't wait to visit the new centre and officially launch it. In the meantime, I'm delighted that the doors are open and it's servicing and helping young people in the Ryan electorate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I rise today to throw my support behind thousands of nurses and midwives across New South Wales who are preparing to strike tomorrow for the first time in 10 years. This strike has been a long time coming for our frontline workers, who have, quite frankly, been overworked and undervalued for far too long. Our nurses and midwives are striking for better staffing ratios and a small pay rise. After what they have had to go through over the last two years of the pandemic, it baffles me that it has come to this. They shouldn't need to strike to be heard. Our nurses want to give the best possible care, and this means they cannot keep working with unsafe ratios. They cannot keep running themselves into the ground. They are exhausted. They're striking because their calls for a one to three ratio in ED and a one-to-four ratio on the ward are falling on deaf ears. The fact is: our nurses and midwives are currently running on goodwill in a broken system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow, I'll be travelling to the Yass hospital to stand with workers and show them that I care—that I am listening. I wish more coalition members would do the same so they could hear firsthand what our nurses and midwives are experiencing every day. Staffing problems and ratios are a significant problem right across New South Wales. In Bega, we have a brand-new hospital, but we don't have the staff to fill it. In Yass, the ward was supposed to be closed for two weeks over Christmas; it ended up being closed for over a month, only opening on 31 January. Nurses and healthcare workers have borne the brunt of this pandemic and our healthcare system has been unprepared to cope with it. They have always had our community's back, and, as they strike tomorrow, I am proud to have theirs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

These security cameras, which have been funded for a long period of time now, are making a real difference. When you switch these cameras on, you switch off crime, you detect crime, you deter crime, and it gives the community great confidence. In the electorate of Casey, new networks are being installed in Warburton, Millgrove, Seville, Wandin and Montrose. An existing network in Monbulk has also been extended to the new pavilion at the Monbulk Recreation Reserve. Existing camera networks are located in Lilydale, Healesville, Yarra Junction, Yarra Glen, Woori Yallock, Mount Evelyn, Mooroolbark and Belgrave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this has been a very successful program, not just for the towns themselves but for the collective of those towns that I read out. It really has created a network across the Yarra Valley-Dandenong Ranges and the outer east of Melbourne that has been most useful for the police. The cameras go straight back to the police stations. Of course, the footage is stored, and it's made a real difference in fighting crime—graffiti, vandalism and some very serious crimes as well. I pay tribute to this program, and long may it continue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  Buying a brand-new home in a brand-new housing estate should be an exciting and happy time for any family, especially when they've bought in at a premium price, with the promise of first-rate community facilities, infrastructure and services. But for residents of the Ashbury housing estate in Armstrong Creek, within my electorate, it hasn't turned out as promised. They've been badly let down by their council, the City of Greater Geelong. Council has failed to ensure delivery of much promised infrastructure and services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with a group of Ashbury residents recently and was dismayed to hear of the challenges they and their children are facing in getting basic services, like walking and bike paths, playgrounds, sporting and community facilities and road traffic safety treatments. They were promised these facilities by council, and they were told they would be well and truly delivered by now. But, instead of playing fields, there is a mosquito-ridden drainage swamp. Instead of 18 kilometres of bike and walking paths, there is predominantly long grass and mud. Major access roads to the estate are potholed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents rightly feel neglected. Other estates are receiving promised infrastructure while their estate is lagging. Residents deserve to know a time frame for the provision of overdue facilities. That's why I've started up a petition. I want residents to sign the petition, to have a voice to say to the council: 'You must deliver the infrastructure. You must deliver it now.' I urge the council to do the right thing and deliver what's promised.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Earlier this chamber debated a motion on the space industry. Unfortunately, because of time constraints on the debate, I missed an opportunity to speak, so I briefly want to add my support to that motion. I am from Adelaide, and the Australian Space Agency is located only a few hundred metres outside of my electorate. It's a great honour to have the Space Agency based in South Australia. South Australia has an enviable heritage when it comes to the space industry in this country. Of course, we have the Woomera Test Range in northern South Australia. Andy Thomas, the first Australian to travel into space, a great Australian hero, is from Adelaide and went to the same school as I did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Space as an industry will grow exponentially over the next few years. We plan to increase it to a $12 billion industry, and that might be low-balling. It's probably the sort of sector that will grow way beyond our expectations. But it is definitely the future. We must have a Commonwealth focus on this area. We have that now, having established the Australian Space Agency back in late 2018. It was decided that it would be headquartered in Adelaide. That has meant that an ecosystem has grown up around that agency at Lot Fourteen in Adelaide. I'm a great supporter of the industry. It's going to be a huge part of the South Australian economy into the future, and that's why I support the motion that was passed earlier today.</span>

This was very well deserved—indeed, as were all the other recipients. Trish is the creator and administrator of the very successful local Facebook group Murwillumbah Matters. The page now has almost 30,000 followers, and Trish works tirelessly to provide information for our community. This was especially true during our devastating floods of 2017. Throughout the past two years during the pandemic, Trish has been there, working tirelessly to provide information for us, always updating us. Murwillumbah Matters is always a great place to get local information and support across a whole range of issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Running a Facebook page can be very challenging at times, but Trish is always respectful of the very differing views within our community. Murwillumbah Matters really provides a great place for people in the community just to find information, provide support and pass on other information. As Trish said when she received the reward, 'It's a joy to run a successful community page where information is vital and gives people a chance to be heard.' She said it was challenging during the height of the pandemic, but she felt people were relying on her. People are relying on you, Trish, and we really appreciate your commitment to our community through Murwillumbah Matters. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  There's nothing quite as sad as hearing aged-care nurses and carers these days talking about their love for the job that they do and then telling you why they just can't do it anymore. I can't count the number of aged-care workers who've told me that they just can't keep going—people like Sue, who told me she has been an aged-care nurse for 20 years. She has had the honour of nursing the parents of many friends in our local area but has walked away from it. She has described it as 'too shameful to continue doing the job'. So I'm very pleased to speak to this motion moved by the member for Corangamite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nurses and carers are walking away because they know they simply can't meet their own standards of care and that the load is just too great. Another worker tells me how hard it is to communicate with residents with the masks, the face shields, the full PPE, and says some of the nicest moments with residents are when she can link families via Zoom and FaceTime. She says 'watching their faces light up with happiness, just being able to see each other' is a real highlight for her, as is delivering parcels that families have dropped at the front door, the closest that families can get to their loved one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that care workers see that, as hard as it is for them, it's really hard on residents and their families. Tony, another aged-care worker, tells me that he loved working in aged care, but, he says, 'The government has stripped me of my love for aged care, and I will not work in it again.' It is a real loss to the sector that, throughout this pandemic, incredible carers and nurses have walked away because they just don't feel supported by this government. There haven't been the resources put in to make their job bearable. Families are seeing that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marie has described to me how her uncle has been locked in his room since the week before Christmas. The week she wrote this to me she said that he was 'now allowed to have a visitor, but the visitor had to bring their own rapid antigen test and do it on site'. Of course, in the past few weeks, that has been a really difficult thing to find, let alone for people to be able to afford. For Karen, the decline in her mum from the ongoing lockdown is really apparent to her. Her mum suffers dementia. Karen says that when she's able to get out she is stimulated and operates at a much better level. But that obviously hasn't been happening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the stories that show how critical the situation is in aged care. I think the Morrison government has been betting on out of sight, out of mind when it comes to aged care, that only a relatively small number of people are in residential aged care or work there or visit, and that people just won't notice. Well, we've all noticed. It isn't good enough that aged care is being really left on its own to struggle through some extremely difficult times. I think the government is betting on the fact that these are the people who will be silenced either by age, by exhaustion or by respect, because the families of residents really respect what the workers are doing and they don't want to make life more difficult for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission, which cost more than $100 million, told us this before COVID, before the pandemic. The report, which was the size of a box of wine, showed us that it isn't good enough and there is neglect in these facilities. That was before COVID. I wish that had been enough to distract the Prime Minister from his photo-ops and the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services from going to the cricket. Clearly, it wasn't enough. The pandemic continues to be not enough to get their attention—the attention that aged-care residents deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has to be bad, doesn't it, when the government calls in the troops? It is bad beyond what any of us not living or working in those facilities can perceive. I don't speak from my own perspective in recent times. I haven't been inside an aged-care facility since Boxing Day because of the ongoing lockdowns that occur. It opens for a day and then an outbreak slams it shut. My mum, like many others, has to look at an email at 11 o'clock tonight to see if she's allowed to go and feed my father the next day. This is what so many families are going through. We cannot, in this place, think that that is good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to challenge the concept that the people who live in aged care are palliative. They're not. They are living and they deserve a richness to their lives. It is our job in parliament and as a government to make that happen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I thank my friend the member for Corangamite for moving this motion and bringing this debate to the parliament. The aged-care crisis is an utter disgrace. This is a national emergency. This is a national crisis. It is not an exaggeration to say that. Right now we have more than 1,100 separate COVID outbreaks in aged-care facilities across this country. Many of our most vulnerable Australians, in their frailer years and days, are isolated in their rooms week after week. They are alone and scared. Some of them are in their last days and they will die alone because the government didn't order enough rapid antigen tests to give to the aged-care facilities and they can't have visitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They rightly expect the government to support them, given all they've done for our country. One-quarter of workers' shifts are unfilled. That means no food, no showers and no toilets. Aged-care residents across the country are left untoileted and unbathed. There have been more than 640 deaths in aged-care facilities this year alone, many of which were preventable. They should not have happened. Those older Australians should be alive. They are literally dying because of this government's inaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the government's response? The Prime Minister's standard formula—to deny there's a crisis. He says there's no crisis. In fact, the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services said that it's all going 'exceptionally well'. Why is the government calling in the Army if there is no crisis? The Prime Minister lives in denial. Some 60 per cent of workers still haven't had their booster shot, and we know the difference that the booster shots make to transmitting COVID. They slash the risk of outbreaks. More than 60,000 residents, our most vulnerable Australians, have not had their booster shots because of this government's incompetence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If denial doesn't work then he distracts. He was washing a woman's hair in a hair salon—in a downright creepy fashion, frankly—when he could have gone to an aged-care facility and washed the hair of someone who actually needed it. He could have done something useful with his time. If that doesn't work then he deflects. He tries yet again to blame the states, just like he did during the Victorian outbreak in 2020, when the vast majority of deaths of Victorians were in Commonwealth run aged-care facilities, because of his failure and neglect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When all else fails he dreams up something, but it's always too little, too late—like the insulting $400 bribe to aged-care workers. It's another bribe that runs out, of course, around the election. Do you know how many aged-care workers are going to get that $400? Six per cent, because it's pro-rataed. What this government has done to the aged-care sector is criminal—casualisation. Only six per cent of aged-care workers in this country have a full-time permanent job. Only six per cent of them will get the $400. The rest of them would be lucky to get $100 or $200. That is not dealing with the aged-care crisis. It's an announcement that he made up to try and survive the National Press Club, not a serious response to this national emergency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the big lie—or the untruth, because I'm not allowed to tell the truth and call the Prime Minister a liar, of course, under the standing orders—is his line: 'It's COVID. It's a one-in-100-year pandemic.' Well, yes, sure it is a pandemic. But he was warned. He was told about this outbreak. He knew it would happen. He was told there'd be more strains. He didn't order the rapid antigen tests like every other developed country did. Their governments secured supplies, but not this bloke. He wanted to leave it to Harvey Norman and the private sector to make a profit instead of buying them with taxpayer funds for a lower rate and giving them to the community. Shame on him! But, really, it comes after a decade of neglect. That is the big lie. It didn't just creep up on him. It's not like someone yelled, 'Surprise, there's an aged-care crisis!' He's in his ninth year of government—nearly a decade of failure and neglect. The one common thread through all of this is the Prime Minister himself. He was the Minister for Social Services who presided over nearly $2 billion of cuts to aged care, he was the Treasurer who baked them into the budget, and now he's the Prime Minister. He broke it. He owns it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, of course, the pandemic has exacerbated and weakened the sector. But these problems are longstanding, and they're structural. The government has had 21 expert reports into this crisis. He then commissioned a royal commission, thinking he was going to lose the election and he'd kick it down the road to be Labor's fault. There were 148 recommendations, and he hasn't responded to over half of them or he has made an inadequate response. There's no 24/7 nurse on call in a nursing home, nothing for workers' wages—and $3.2 billion has been given to providers, with no strings attached. Shame on him. He should sack the minister and then sack himself.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  Aged-care workers came to Canberra last week, exhausted and overworked, some straight from a night shift, determined to tell their stories so that Australians know the truth about aged care. They spoke of frail, elderly people stuck in their rooms with wounds untended, without water to drink, and sitting for hours in incontinence pads left unchanged. They spoke of their devastation at not having time to care, to comfort someone dying alone or to share a kind word. Sadly, this government was warned and failed to act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was clear from countless reports and inquiries that the aged-care system was in crisis long before the pandemic. But many people will remember that it wasn't until <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> aired their investigation into abuse and neglect in residential aged-care homes in 2018 that the Prime Minister was forced to act. The final report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, <span style="font-style:italic;">Care, dignity and respe</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ct</span>, was delivered, almost 12 months ago, in February last year. The report contained 148 recommendations to urgently address the crisis in aged care. Some 12 months later the implementation of any of the recommendations has been painfully slow—even recommendations which were accepted in full, which were less than half. Many are only being partly implemented, and nearly a quarter have been rejected outright or listed for further consideration. As a result, the aged-care sector has lurched from neglect to crisis, and older Australians are the ones who are bearing the brunt of the government's inaction. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm often contacted by locals concerned about the quality of care. They know that aged-care workers are dedicated but under strain. They know that aged-care workers are doing their best but in a crisis. Bruce from Hamlyn Terrace told me that his sister-in-law has been in aged care for five years and that, during that time, he's noticed a significant deterioration in the quality of care, particularly after the home was taken over by a major corporate provider. Bruce said that prescriptions don't appear to be kept up to date, sandwiches now count as meals for both lunch and dinner, and the home is completely understaffed. He was concerned, after his sister-in-law's diabetes diagnosis, that the meals provided would cause her health to deteriorate further. He says that when the family couldn't visit due to COVID restrictions it was impossible to get an update on his sister-in-law's care, but they are reluctant to complain in case it impacts her. He said: 'Nobody is doing anything or taking notice of residents' needs. Something needs to be done.' This can't and won't improve while aged care is underfunded and understaffed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care homes are already struggling to retain existing staff, and the token buyout of a retention bonus from the government won't keep aged-care workers in the system or attract others while work is insecure and the demands grow day by day. Aged-care workers are dedicated, but a warm inner glow doesn't pay the rent, keep food on the table or protect their family from harm. Leanne, an aged-care worker from Lake Haven, told me recently:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Nothing has been done to retain aged care workers through improved wages or conditions. Politicians have constantly been told of this crisis. Staff are leaving the workforce, they are burnt out, tired, sad, working so many additional hours to cover staff shortages. We are overwhelmed with conflicting responsibilities—to care for residents, look after our own health and that of our families. Making sure we don't let our guard down even in our private lives, the care of the residents is at the forefront of our thoughts even when not at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">Aged care workers are being separated from our families to try and keep the residents safe. How can we continue to work like this? We are giving our absolute best, but that just isn't good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was four years ago yesterday that I lost my father to younger onset dementia, a cruel disease that stole my father from us piece by piece, day by day. I will be forever grateful to the dedicated aged-care staff at his day care centre, in my parents' home and in respite care who lovingly helped to care for my father. But I cannot forgive this Prime Minister for his cuts to aged care as Treasurer, leaving older Australians abandoned and neglected and alone. And I can never forgive the minister for aged care for abandoning older Australians in his care, under his responsibility, and for leaving aged-care workers exhausted, overworked and in crisis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  I rise to support the motion regarding the recommendation of the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal for the creation of a new class of medals and clasps, which recognises the loss suffered by families of Australian Defence Force personnel killed or wounded as a result of their service. This recommendation was made following a referral of the matter to the tribunal in January last year by the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting that Australia, through the Order of Australia and the Australian Defence Force honours and awards system, already recognises the service of ADF members. However, there is a need for an expression of the gratitude of the nation for individual sacrifice. The tribunal therefore recommended that the time had come for Australia to initiate a physical expression of its gratitude to members and their families. This would provide a meaningful and widely recognisable expression of national gratitude for the sacrifice of ADF members killed or suffering a serious wound, injury or disease as a result of their service, and that of their families, and would do so in a way that allowed existing Defence Force honours and awards to better tell the story of that service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to take the opportunity this afternoon to speak about the contribution many local businesses are making to Australia's defence industry; in particular, a couple of businesses in my home state of Queensland. I've spoken before in the chamber about the Rheinmetall factory in Redbank, in the heart of the Oxley electorate. I've had the privilege of visiting that facility, and I'm so pleased that a Defence Force capability is being built in the Oxley electorate. It's certainly my hope and vision, as the member for Oxley, that our region, particularly the south-west suburbs of Brisbane and the Ipswich corridor, becomes the hub or epicentre of Defence Force manufacturing in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the opportunities I've had of talking to the sector and its industries, I was lucky enough to visit a world-leading Queensland company, Gilmour Space Technologies. The company was founded in 2013 by brothers Adam and James who, by sheer willpower, built a company which will be launching small satellites into orbit later this year. Gilmour will make lower-cost access to space available, and their first payload will be a bushfire early warning satellite. The work that the company is doing is incredibly important in improving Australia's sovereign capability. The company receives support from the Queensland government, including an investment by QIC announced by the Queensland Treasurer in July last year. This was part of the company's $61 million series C capital raise. Clearly, the private sector sees the opportunity here, as we all should. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government recently included space as one of the 14 sovereign industrial capability priorities for Defence. Last year defence scientists signed an agreement with Gilmour to develop defence related space technologies as part of a long-term strategic arrangement. There is plenty happening in this sphere, particularly at Gilmour Space Technologies. I look forward to their first launch from Queensland soil later this year, and I strongly encourage the federal government and the Department of Defence to look for more ways to work together to support the company's efforts to get Australia and Queensland into the space race. I'm really proud that Queensland is leading the way when it comes to not only investment but also the opportunities for our Defence Force capabilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to highlight the work of Products For Industry, a locally owned and operated business. PFi Aerospace work for the Australian Defence Force using their program Skyfall, a low-cost, high-volume, client-customisable real-world threat simulator, and they have also unveiled their Australian development program for low-cost, high-speed surrogate ballistic targets designed to provide enhanced local, area and theatre air defence training for the Australian Defence Force and allied nations. Once again, I commend this motion and the intent behind it to the House, and I want to finish by recognising the incredible service of each and every member of Australia's Defence Force, past and present. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  It is a privilege to rise to speak to this motion. I'd like to recognise some of my colleagues who are also participating in this debate and may have already spoken. I note in particular the members for Blair, Solomon and Bradman. The recognition of our veterans and their service is an issue which enjoys bipartisan support in this place. I know all members, not just the ones contributing to this debate, share a common desire to see our veterans and their families cared for and recognised. But sometimes that care and recognition is elusive and can only be found after some struggle and trouble. That is why this motion is so important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As things stand, Australia lacks formal recognition of injuries, wounding and death in service. If you look around the world, other countries have formal recognition for wounding and death in the service. The United States, of course, famously has the Purple Heart. Canada has the Memorial Cross and the Sacrifice Medal. France has the Medal for the War Wounded. India has the Wound Medal. The United Kingdom has the Elizabeth Cross. Sweden has the Armed Forces Medal for Wounded in Battle. But Australia has no such recognition for our defence personnel who are injured or killed in the course of their service. This is in spite of the fact that, since the Second World War, our service personnel have experienced a variety of deployments around the world. These have ranged from peacekeeping missions to counterinsurgency stabilisation missions, to direct combat against an enemy force. These deployments have been dangerous, and many of our service personnel have been injured or killed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the dangers from service do not begin and end with a deployment overseas. Too many are injured and even killed in training and other everyday occurrences and accidents relating to service. Make no mistake: serving your country carries dangers, and it's frankly baffling that we have no suitable recognition for those who fall victim to those dangers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a peacetime accident that brought into stark contrast this lack of recognition for the price of service. In 1996, two Black Hawk helicopters carrying troopers from the Special Air Service Regiment collided near Townsville. When the smoke cleared, 15 members of the Special Air Service Regiment were dead, as well as three members of the 5th Aviation Regiment. This terrible disaster highlighted that those who were killed and wounded in this accident would receive no formal recognition for their sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Kerry and Kay Danes, this accident was a catalyst. Alongside others, they began to campaign for proper recognition for those wounded and killed in service. Like others have in too many examples, they had to struggle against the inertia of a bureaucracy which often seems allergic to change. Indeed, in the course of my work as the member for Bean, I've been approached by many veterans whose service has not been appropriately recognised. For some, my representations have resulted in some measure of justice or recognition; for others, the work continues; and, for some, the recognition comes too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After some time, the government agreed to an inquiry which resulted in the recommendation from the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal that we are discussing today. We are finally at a point where we will be able to secure recognition for the service of those killed and injured in our Defence Force. But the final steps are up to this government. The final steps to turn the recommendation from the tribunal into an applicable mechanism for award recognition are entirely up to this government. I commend this motion, and I call on the government to take all necessary steps to finally give full recognition to those wounded and killed in the service of our country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  Access to high-quality public education is a fundamental right, particularly when you're training to work in a dangerous job. Working with horses is one of those jobs. The equine industry is a pillar of the Hawkesbury, estimated to be worth around $160 million per year. Formal training for those working in the industry helps to make sure everyone comes home safely at the end of their day—from the races, from shows or simply from holding horses for the farrier or leading them from the stables to the paddock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales government is undermining this valuable industry in the Hawkesbury by axing equine studies from Richmond TAFE. Under the Liberals' plan, a total of three racing industry courses and performance horse studies will go, and farriery will move into animal studies. It also means 12 dedicated TAFE teachers will lose their jobs. Slashing equine courses from Richmond TAFE has caused deep concern among the horse community in the Hawkesbury, from employers to students to teachers to former Melbourne Cup-winning jockey Darren Beadman, now working with global racing giant Godolphin. But I've also heard from people who might have a horse or two in the Hawkesbury who are simply worried about what the cuts will mean for the future of the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A rally held at the campus last Friday added many more voices calling for an end to these ridiculous proposed cuts. Among those was Brooke, a trainer at Hawkesbury Race Club who is responsible for 25 horses. She did her accreditation through TAFE. She said the closure of the equine course will not only mean it'll be harder to find workers to fill roles in her stables; it could also make the workplace more dangerous. Brooke says that TAFE teaches students horse management, how to manage wounds and how to spot injuries. There's a riding program so that students can also safely learn how to manage different horse temperaments. She told me that, if the course doesn't exist, they're going to have to learn on the job, but she fears that will lead to more workplace accidents, describing it as 'a strong possibility'. That's the fear from someone in the industry. Tara, who co-trains horses in the Hawkesbury, has employed students from Richmond TAFE. She just can't believe that the equine courses are being abandoned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Graduate Montana tells me that, when she was 16, she travelled an hour each way by car with her mum to attend Richmond TAFE. She gained a valuable set of skills that landed her a job she loved in the racing industry. Here's what she says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It gave me so many opportunities in the industry and if they stop the courses it's going to take those opportunities away from so many kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixteen-year-old Brianna is one of those kids. She's been riding since she was five and wants to turn her passion into a career. She was devastated when her application to study at Richmond this year was unsuccessful, and she came to the rally with her mum to support reinstating the courses. All students at the rally spoke of the extraordinary dedication of the TAFE staff—people who love sharing their passion for the animals and passing on their knowledge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's also concerning is what these cuts will mean for the future of the area. There are so many unanswered questions surrounding this move. With the viability of Richmond TAFE undermined, what is the future of that campus? What effect will the cuts have on the future of the local equine industry? And, if the industry heads elsewhere, will we see more development and the loss of what is now a prized rural lifestyle?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to quality vocational job training and education should be expanded, not dismantled. It's what an Albanese government would deliver, providing 465,000 free TAFE places. That's including 45,000 new places under our free TAFE plan. The Liberal-National government has cut TAFE and slashed apprenticeships for nearly a decade now, and we have 85,000 fewer apprenticeships and traineeships compared to 2013. That's what the government has done. Cuts like those happening in Richmond are part of the Liberals' privatisation by stealth, something we want to end by ensuring that at least 70 per cent of Commonwealth funding and Commonwealth vocational educational funding is dedicated to our public TAFE. Free TAFE will help rebuild industries hit hardest by the pandemic, like hospitality and tourism, as well as meet current and future needs in the care economy—things like child care, aged care, disability care, nursing and community services. Free TAFE will provide opportunities for school leavers in the new energy jobs and advanced manufacturing of the future, and only Labor will deliver that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  As the member for Chisholm I want people in my community, from Box Hill to Wheelers Hill, to get ahead, whether that is through developing a new skill or pursuing further study. Today I am proud to say that Australia's education and training system is strong, with guaranteed choices for Australians looking into a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring that Australians have the right skills for the workforce of today and the future. That's why we are providing a record $7.7 billion in skills and training this year—that is more than double the pre-COVID levels—to support students and apprentices, training organisations and employers. As part of our economic response to COVID-19, we are providing free or low-fee training courses across the nation through the $2 billion JobTrainer Fund so Australians can upskill or reskill in areas of identified skills need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a fantastic program, and less than two weeks ago it was great to be able to talk about JobTrainer with the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison; and the Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business, Stuart Robert. The setting was KOR Equipment Solutions in Mulgrave, an amazing local trucking company and a fitting place to share the news that JobTrainer has now seen more than 300,000 enrolments across the country, with nearly 100,000 course completions in areas of employment growth. I want to take this opportunity to thank KOR managing director Stephen Pewtress for hosting us on site and for talking us through some of the company's own fantastic training programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to this record of achievement, you have the Labor Party. When it comes to helping Australians get the skills they need to get into a job, Anthony Albanese's record is pretty clear, and it's a record of failure. The last time Labor was in government, in 2012-13, the number of apprentices and trainees in training collapsed by 22 per cent or 110,000. Between 2011 and 2013, when Anthony Albanese sat at the cabinet table, Labor cut employer incentives to businesses that employ apprentices nine times, totalling $1.2 billion. And let's not forget the failed VET FEE-HELP system, which resulted in thousands of Australians being lured into dodgy courses with free iPads and dubious career opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now you have to feel for the member for Dunkley, who has been sent out to attack our skills and training policies, when it is those same policies that have delivered record numbers of trade apprentices in her own electorate. Departmental program data demonstrates that trade apprenticeships hit over 1,540 in Dunkley in September 2021, the highest number on record, and an increase of 41 per cent since Labor left office. So it is clear that Australia's skills system is firing ahead, both in the member for Dunkley's electorate and across the nation. It is not, as the Labor Party would argue, a system in crisis. The only people talking down skills and training in Australia seem to be Anthony Albanese and the rest of the Labor Party. Well, they're entitled to do it, but we'll just keep getting on with the job of delivering more jobs and more opportunities for the people of Chisholm and the people of Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We do have very different values and priorities. I put my name down to speak on this motion because it's incredibly important. We often hear the catchcry that Liberal and Labor are both the same. There's that bloke that keeps putting those ads on the front of the newspapers saying that we're the same. But I'm sure those opposite would agree that we're not the same. We have different values when it comes to different policy settings. I think it's just become the catchcry of opportunists, the cynical, the disengaged or others who have different motives altogether. But it is true—and I tell people this when I'm in my electorate—that we work together across the aisle most of the time, but from time to time we have differences in policy because we attach a different value to things. I'm proud that when it comes to education it is really important in our mob, and that's what I'll talk about. I won't be like the member for Chisholm, just having a crack at the Leader of the Opposition, with some ridiculous stats she's plucked from somewhere. But I agree with the member for Dunkley.

                  </a>  I was just saying how committed federal Labor is to education and I was painting a picture of what had happened prior to the COVID pandemic arriving. I guess the dangers were there for all to see. Before the pandemic we had an overreliance on international students. We assumed that they would always be travelling here. Once the pandemic hit, the federal government excluded higher education from its JobKeeper package, providing a further and completely unnecessary hit to the bottom line of universities. We all know that some companies and organisations with rising revenue—they were doing well and didn't need JobKeeper—got it. The unis really struggled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government did drop the ball when it came to supporting unis. We on this side will not and have not. We have a series of plans that will put the sector back on track, with real benefits for every level of education in this country. We'll start by rebuilding the tertiary education sector, which was so badly hit during the pandemic, by creating up to 20,000 new university places across the country, including at Charles Darwin University in my electorate. We're also going to stop the rort in the skills and training being provided, by providing a massive 465,000 free TAFE places, which will give every Aussie kid an opportunity to learn at TAFE or a VET training provider. We will take advantage of the opportunity presented by the climate crisis and will support 10,000 new energy apprenticeships. All of this is underpinned by the Australian Skills Guarantee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Younger Australians in primary and high schools have faced so much disruption. We'll invest $440 million to improve ventilation in classrooms and to provide more counselling and psychological support. I have a couple of young kids at primary school. All the staff have been fantastic. Up in the Northern Territory we've done better than most with the pandemic, in terms of having the kids at school for longer, but I want to give a shout-out to all of our educators, principals and staff, who have done such a wonderful job. We'll keep backing them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  [by video link] Australia's education, skills and training systems are important for our country's foundation. Education and training lays the groundwork for strong economic growth and creates pathways for more jobs, skilled and experienced workers, and stability across the nation. The Morrison government recognises that young Australians have been heavily impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns, creating increased levels of stress and anxiety, disrupted school routines, restricted face-to-face contact and difficulties associated with social relationships. But the resilience and adaptability of each and every school system and each and every teacher is to be applauded. It is great to see that more than four million students have returned to the classroom for 2022. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The education and training of young Australians is paramount. Choosing to invest in the time it takes to hone the skills you need to get into a job is one of the most important decisions you will ever make, because the skills you develop can help you get your dream job. I want people in my community of Longman to get ahead, whether that's through developing a new skill or pursuing further study. I'm proud to say that today's Australian education and training systems are strong, with guaranteed choices for Australians looking to get into a job or wanting to start a trade or their dream career. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring that people have the right skills for the workforce today and in the future, and I expect the future of education and training to be even stronger under the Morrison government. Through record funding, $7.1 billion in this financial year alone, the Morrison government is ensuring that Australians, whether they live in a city, on the outskirts of a city, or in a rural or regional area, can get into high-quality jobs in their local area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, our $2 billion JobTrainer Fund is supporting up to 463,000 placements in free or low-fee courses in areas of skill shortage through TAFE and registered training organisations. We are seeing results. We started 2022 on the right track, with almost half a million job-ready Australians skilled up, with over 300,000 Job Trainer enrolments and the highest level of trade apprentices on record, with 220,000 in training. That is why the government is providing a record $7.7 billion investment in skills and training this year, 2021-22, more than double pre-COVID levels, to support students, apprentices, training organisations and employers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of its economic response to COVID-19, the Australian government is providing free or low-fee training courses across the nation through its $2 billion JobTrainer Fund so that Australians can upskill or reskill in areas of identified skills need. This investment has seen more than 300,000 JobTrainer enrolments across the country, with nearly 100,000 course completions in areas of employment growth. As part of the 2021-22 budget, the Australian government extended the JobTrainer Fund until 31 December 2022 and expanded it to fund a further 163,000 placements—great news indeed. Under the extension, any Australian who wants to enrol in aged care, digital skills, disability care or childcare qualifications can access a JobTrainer place, regardless of their age, employment status or prior qualifications. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to JobTrainer, the Australian government has invested $4.8 billion over four years from 2020-21 through the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy to support businesses and group training organisations to take on new apprentices and trainees. This includes $1.2 billion announced in the 2020-21 budget, $2.7 billion announced in the 2021-22 budget, and a further $900 million through the portfolio additional estimates statements 2021-22. There are already more than 1,300 apprentices in Longman, and these new measures will lead to even more opportunities for apprentices and trainees in my electorate and around the country, with expanded wage subsidies. The number of Australians taking up a trade apprenticeship is at its highest level since data was first collected in 1963. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to school funding, this government invested a record $23.4 billion in all Australian schools last year and will invest a further record $24.8 billion this year. Since we first came to government, funding across all schools has increased by 80 per cent and will increase by a further 40 per cent by 2029. Commonwealth funding for government schools has doubled—it's grown by 100.7 per cent—since 2013 and will see a further 46 per cent increase to 2029. We've locked in record school funding that provides fairer funding for Australian schools, agreed to by all state and territories and approved school authorities. The success of these— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  I'm pleased to contribute to this important motion today about the impact of cybersecurity and, moreover, the attacks that have taken place against Australia and Australians. There are many well-known sayings we're familiar with in this place: 'as safe as houses' or, as we used to say, 'as safe as the Bank of England'; and, if something was secure or impenetrable, we always used to say it was 'as secure as Fort Knox'. Well, it's no longer enough to ensure that our banks are safe and secure; our IT and online software programs need to be as well. It's more than just the buildings and the infrastructure; it's the software and the computer hard drives et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's motion refers to the impacts of cyberattacks on Australian businesses. Some would assume that cyberattacks are simply targeted at large organisations and corporations. I say: not so—not so at all. Unfortunately, I've seen it even locally, with such organisations as Riverina Water. Just last year, the local water supply organisation for the southern part of my electorate, servicing 73,000 people with fresh drinking and domestic water across four local government areas, had its IT systems hacked as a result of an unauthorised electronic intrusion. They are not alone. Indeed, we've heard from previous government speakers, in this and other debates, about the attacks on local governments and other organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's critical that people update their software and put those patches on. It's critical that, indeed, they do visit the various government websites—and cyber.gov.au would be a very good start—to take the steps to protect themselves, their businesses, their families and Australia's digital sovereignty. It's critical that they protect their businesses and their bottom lines, because to get hacked means that you could very well have all your information sent overseas by nefarious characters who would use it to harm you and, potentially, your families, and, indeed, Australia's digital sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard some very good remarks in question time today from the Minister for Home Affairs, who talked about, last November, this government introducing into parliament, and passing, the first tranche of its critical infrastructure reforms so that our nation is much better equipped to deal with a range of threats, including cyberattacks. That was the first stage of a two-part legislative approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the home affairs minister introduced the second tranche of this critical infrastructure legislation into the House of Representatives. It includes changes that will deal with risk management systems and how requirements for systems of national significance are actually put in place and administered. Minister Andrews talked about the Australian Cyber Security Centre receiving more than 67,500 cybercrime reports just in the last financial year alone and that more than a quarter of those incidents were on critical infrastructure systems. She said that these critical infrastructure systems are the systems that deliver 'essential services that all Australians rely on'. They include such things as water and sewerage, energy, our banking and financial services, transport, and food and groceries. As she said, and as she reported to the House in question time today, any threat to these very vital services is a threat to our way of life. If anybody were to become complacent about these things, that would be a critical error to make, because, as I said, it's very often the case that it's small businesses, family-run businesses, that are the target of these attacks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an article in April 2021 in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>, it was reported that more than half of the businesses in Australia reported being cyberattacked—more than half! That is an amazing statistic. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Review</span> reported that these businesses lost an average of four days of productivity just to get their businesses back online. The frustration, the exasperation of that when you're trying run a small business, particularly during COVID—it's difficult enough without these attacks. That's why I urge and encourage people to visit cyber.gov.au. The other thing is that half of the businesses that were impacted paid their attackers and many of them did not have their stolen data returned. There's a lesson to be learnt there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, make sure you've got the right patches, make sure you have the right processes in place, and never, ever be complacent when it comes to cybersecurity. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has been in government in this country for 19 of the last 25 years, and it has been in government for the last nine years. Today, when the government talks up the importance of national and regional security, when there is instability in the region and when Australia should be prepared, Australia has an ageing submarine fleet, no submarine replacement contracts and no clear path for the replacement submarines. All we have is an announcement about nuclear submarines and an agreement with the USA and the UK. None of us know what's in that agreement, but we have, supposedly, an agreement. We don't know who the supplier is going to be, we don't know how many submarines are going to be ordered, we don't know what the cost will be, we don't have a delivery date, and we have no commitment whatsoever on the Australian workforce content or even the skills that will be required if we do have Australian participation in the build. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Simultaneously, we have thousands of workers and small businesses throughout this country who had secured contracts and work from the French submarine replacement program who have been left hanging with no contract, no work and no certainty about their own future. Hundreds of millions and perhaps even billions of dollars have been wasted over the French submarine contract. Again, we'll probably never know what the real figure is, but there is no doubt that the figure will run into that amount of money—such has been the incompetence of this Morrison government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last nine years this coalition government has gone from a Japanese proposal, under the Abbott prime ministership, to a French contract, under the prime ministership of Mr Turnbull and the then Minister for Defence, Minister Pyne, to the US-UK nuclear option under Prime Minister Morrison and the Minister for Defence, Mr Dutton. This is a serious issue. The Australian government's incompetence has undoubtedly damaged Australia's credibility and trust around the world, particularly with important allies in Japan and the European Union. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have credible reports that the proposed Hunter class frigates may also not be fit for purpose. The BAE model is reportedly too slow, unsafe and more costly to run. These are huge investments, estimated at $45 billion for the nine frigates alone. To have doubts about the design and suitability before we even start the build, again, highlights the incompetence and bungling of this government. I hope we don't go down the path of seeing hundreds of millions of dollars wasted again. What is somewhat concerning is that BAE, which is the builder of these frigates, has also been suggested as the possible builder of the submarines. That in itself raises questions. Of course, none of the government ministers responsible for those decisions are likely to be around in 10 or 20 years time or whenever any of these vessels are delivered, be they the frigates, which are supposed to come online in 2033 or thereabouts, or the submarines in 2040. They won't be around to be held to account for their decisions today, just as former Minister Christopher Pyne, who campaigned on delivering the submarine contract to South Australians in 2016, is no longer here to account for the embarrassing backflip and failure of his government to deliver for South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real issue here is that the naval fleet, and the work attached to it, is so important, particularly given this government's decimation of the auto industry around Australia and particularly in South Australia, where the hope was that the naval contracts would at least pick up some of the losses that we incurred as a result of the auto industry being closed. Sadly, we have no guarantee at all that that will be the case, particularly with the submarine contract, which for the last six or seven years has been mooted as being a winner for South Australia. We now have an agreement which tells us nothing about where the submarines will be built, how many jobs will be created in South Australia or what research and development from the South Australian defence industries will go into that. Once again, we see another key South Australian industry left in limbo, with skilled workers being lost and businesses struggling to stay afloat, because the Morrison government treats South Australia as irrelevant and the South Australian Marshall Liberal government is too weak to stand up for South Australia.</span>

I thought: 'This is great. We're going to see some well-earned praise for the coalition government and what it has done for naval shipbuilding, what it has done for defence investment and what it has done for the fine state of South Australia.' But all we get is carping and whining and whingeing—typical negativity. I like the member for Makin. He's a great fellow, but that five minutes that he just delivered is five minutes of my life I'm not going to get back. I'm annoyed about that because I thought he was going to talk up our sovereign capability. I thought he was going to talk up the fact that we are investing record amounts. I thought he might even have been just a tad honest about the fact that, during the Gillard and Rudd years, defence spending dropped—and the defence minister talked about this in question time today—to 1.56 per cent of gross domestic product. That was the lowest level since 1938, and the member for Makin knows, as we all do, what happened in 1939.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr McCORMACK:</span>
                  </a>  There's up to $62 million in workforce growth and skilling initiatives to enable the delivery of these platforms. It's not just the ships and the infrastructure to build those ships; it's the upskilling of the people. It's making sure we've got the right trades and the right apprentices, and, when it comes to getting young people into the workforce to do all those sorts of jobs, there's no better side of the House to do it than the Liberals and the Nationals. We have a proven track record. The member for Makin talked about the longevity of this government and how many years, over the past quarter of a century, we have been in government. There's a reason for that. It's because the people of Australia know and trust that, when it comes to national security and when it comes to defence investment, we will be the right ones on the treasury bench to deliver, and deliver we are doing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the member's reference to the contract with Naval Group and the AUKUS announcement. I'm not going to enter into a debate about contractual arrangements. They form part of the national security, which is quite rightly kept within the confines of the Prime Minister, defence chiefs and others who decide national security. But, whilst I recognise the talents and skills of those who work in the electorate of Makin—I do—I welcome any opportunity for workers in any electorate of Australia to partake in this process. I know, having gone around as the then Assistant Minister for Defence—and, indeed, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs—to the various military bases and to where they manufacture armoured personnel carriers and other equipment, that it is a question of not just where the product is completed but all the other manufacturing plants and factories in towns right across the nation. That includes Tasmania—and I acknowledge the service of the member for Braddon, who is no longer in the chamber. It is the entire country that feeds into the process of getting the right military equipment, and that is what we're doing. When it comes to shipbuilding, 70 defence vessels and 1,700 vehicles are being built in Australia right now.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're getting on with the job. We're getting the job done. That's because the people trust us when it comes to defence and when it comes to national security. When it comes to shipbuilding, certainly, they know that the Liberals and Nationals will deliver, and they remember that when Labor was last in office there was not a ship built. Labor did not build a single ship. We are getting on with the job. We're fixing up the errors of the past—the Labor past—and we're making sure that, for us, national security comes first.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  I rise to speak on this important motion, and I thank the member for Makin for raising this very important debate. For South Australians, defence industry jobs were meant to provide a vital lifeline following the loss of manufacturing in our state, especially the loss of General Motors Holden. Thousands of people worked not just at GMH but at manufacturing plants around the place that supported GMH. But this government's continued mismanagement of defence contracts has thrown the manufacturing industry into chaos and insecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian naval shipbuilding industry is facing a double threat. Firstly, we have the submarines. Most experts feel that the decision to switch to the nuclear option makes sense from a defence point of view, especially given that the French submarines contract was plagued by cost blowouts, changes in the commitment of local content and delays. We on this side of the House have been supportive of the arrangements with the AUKUS deal, the Australia-UK-US deal, but that doesn't mean we can ignore this government's constant bungling of defence contracts; nor should it detract from the fact that it was a diplomatic debacle with the potential to impact Australia's honour, security and sovereignty. As a consequence of this mismanagement, around 350 Naval Group Australia jobs, the majority of which are in South Australia, will be lost. That's not to mention further potential job losses and uncertainty about the future in some of the supply chain companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, the Prime Minister has not provided any details or guarantees as to whether the submarines will be built in Adelaide. This creates continued uncertainty for the workers and associated industries. We must ensure that Australian industry is involved in the development of these submarines from the start in order to ensure that Australia has the capability to maintain the vessels into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, this was reiterated to me during a meeting I had with representatives from Engineers Australia. Their studies have shown that, to meet the demand for workers over the next 12 months, the defence industry will be required to grow at unprecedented levels. This can be challenging at the best of times, as we all know, given the unique nature of defence jobs, such as security clearances and a whole range of other things. While Australia possesses some skills in nuclear, we lack the skills required to work on the maintenance of nuclear propelled submarines. In fact, a 2016 Australian Department of Defence paper looking into Australia's requirement for submarines noted the government had ruled out nuclear since the time required to amass such support systems and skilled people would extend beyond the time frame for replacement of the Collins class fleet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand it takes five to seven years of postgraduate experience before an engineer is considered competent for independent practice. This means we'd need to begin training our local skilled workforce immediately if they're required by 2032 and if we want to employ people here in this country. Given these challenges we must ask the question: even if the submarines are built locally, how many of the jobs will be local? It is not only the submarine project that is creating uncertainty for workers and industry. There are now reports that raise concerns that the future frigates program is facing multiple technical capability and safety issues. The future frigates, the second-largest procurement project in Australia's history, is based in Adelaide, and it's another example of mismanagement by this Morrison government. It's already running $15 billion over budget, it has faced delays over several years, and now we know there are serious concerns that the vessels may be slower, vulnerable to detection and with limited range. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government must take control of our critical defence contracts, get them back on track and see these projects delivered to create local jobs and save current jobs. We on this side of the House have provided a bipartisan commitment to spend $270 billion on defence over the next 10 years. We have committed to the nuclear powered submarines, but we now want to see a clear commitment by this Morrison government and the state's Marshall government to growing our sovereign defence industry with a focus on creating local jobs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  If the global pandemic has reminded us of anything at all it's the importance of national security and our sovereign capability and their impact on Australian jobs and the Australian economy. Minimising our reliance on and the impact from external supply chains and other state forces has never been more important. Thankfully, this government is committed to effectively facilitating all of the above, and Australia's shipbuilding industry forms an important part of this commitment. In fact, a recapitalisation commitment this significant has not been seen since World War II. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad fact is that Australia's national security and strategic environment has seen a negative downturn in recent years, with military modernisation evolving at speeds not experienced before. The capabilities of potential threatening sources have been rapidly advancing and expanding, meaning our homegrown technology edge is not what it used to be. We are now in a position that we must act swiftly to meet the evolving threat, with the Indo-Pacific region now at the centre of strategic competition. It is uncomfortable to realise that our naval shipbuilding enterprise faces a real threat from foreign espionage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said this when discussing matters relating to national security, but the sad fact is that what you can't see can hurt you. There are those with different interests to our own that seek to compromise or collect Australian intelligence. Unfortunately, this includes our next generation of naval capability. Thankfully, under the current proposed reforms to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act, the federal government is introducing a naval shipbuilding identity assurance program. Harnessing the capabilities of AusCheck, it will provide a constant and consistent level of background checking and identity assurance for every person requiring unescorted access to our naval shipyards and multi-user sustainment sites. It will be modelled on the aviation security identity card, also managed by AusCheck, which is used to conduct background checks on people requiring access to restricted areas in airports, and to date this has proven to be very effective. It is a relief to see the program will be rolled out very quickly in the coming year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a very positive note, in my own electorate of Cowper, companies like Birdon Group and Bale Defence are set to benefit directly from the renewed focus of national naval shipbuilding enterprise. Both Port Macquarie based companies have previously secured large-scale overseas contracts, and in recent months it was great to see Bale Defence awarded the ADF contract to supply 40 rough terrain vehicles, with potential for larger future orders. It will be exciting to see Mid North Coast local ingenuity being utilised for our own naval capability, as it absolutely should be. Seeing our world-class local heavy engineering and industrial manufacturing capabilities used to their full potential is a gratifying prospect. This commitment to naval shipbuilding will support at least 15,000 jobs nationwide by the end of the decade, and I look forward to seeing Birdon Group and Bale Defence expand their teams and capabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in the process we must recognise that mid-sized and small Australian companies are more cost-competitive than the large overseas primes and their subsidiaries and suppliers. Australian companies must be given the opportunity to compete and participate on a level playing field as prime contractors. Examples like Birdon Group and Bale Defence in my electorate have already proven their capability and cost-competitiveness in not only US military contracts worth billions of dollars, just for the two, over the past decade, but also have received high praise for quality performance. Before now, I appreciate, there has been a reluctance for local companies to invest in equipment and manpower without the security of Australian contracts to shore up the spend. This government's longer-term commitment now and into the future will allow local industry to invest with confidence.</span>

Firstly, I'd like to thank the member who moved the motion in my absence in a previous sitting week, because debating this motion gives me a great opportunity to express my unwavering support for the Australian Defence Force Cadets, their vital service to the country and the work that they do instilling values into our young people. Service, courage, respect, integrity and excellence—these are the values of the ADF Cadets that underpin their mission to lead and serve our local communities and our nation.</span>

It's, of course, a community based youth development program, which focuses on preserving the customs and traditions of the Australian Defence Force. That's incredibly important for the Ryan community, because the Ryan community is, as I said, home to the Gallipoli Barracks, so it is home to many serving defence personnel but also ex-defence personnel and veterans who have chosen to stay located in the local area and those who have located there as part of their service at the Amberley barracks, further down the highway. We have a very proud tradition in the Ryan electorate of supporting our service men and women and veterans, and promoting the values and the ethos of the Australian Defence Force in the cadets is a tremendous way to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year in May—I'm just trying to get my dates right; with COVID, things tend to blend together—I was very pleased to have the Assistant Minister for Defence, Andrew Hastie, come to the electorate. It was one of the few visits that he was able to successfully complete given the on-and-off border openings in Western Australia. He came to look at the site and to have discussions with those who are helping me lead the charge for the new Brookfield cadet unit in the electorate of Ryan. The Morrison government, at my urging, has already committed some $100,000 in funding to help get this new cadet unit off the ground. There is significant need in the local community. Brookfield is some distance from the existing cadet unit over at Enoggera, and already, since the call was put out that we were looking to establish this unit, over 40 young people have put up their hands and said they are keen to become cadets as this unit is started up. Assistant Minister Hastie is revered for his own service, but not many people would know that he was a cadet himself and he credits the cadets with instilling in him that love of service and that love of country and encouraging him as he got older to then join up to serve in the ADF. It was great to have him there to talk all thing cadets because not only is it his portfolio but he embodies everything we're trying to achieve with the program, in terms of instilling those values in our young Australians and then, hopefully, inspiring them to go on to a career of service with the ADF. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to give a shout-out to the local residents who are helping in this endeavour to put the new cadet unit together—that is, the president of the Kenmore-Moggill RSL Sub Branch, Lieutenant Colonel Rick Maher; and the sub-branch treasurer and a former officer in the Royal Engineers of the British Army, Richard Ponsonby; and Leonie Smith. These individuals have been instrumental in getting this cadet unit started. It was their initiative. They came to me and said, 'We'd really like to start this up. Can you secure some initial funding,' which indeed we have been able to do. As the unit progresses, ultimately, to its establishment, all three of them are working incredibly hard. Rick and Richard are obviously both servicemen themselves and are devoted to bringing that to our local youth, as I am. So I give a shout-out to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also give a shout-out to the 129 Australian Army Cadet Unit, which, as I said, is based at the Gallipoli Barracks, at Enoggera. They have 144 currently serving cadets, so that unit is going very strong. Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, they've still been able to conduct regular parades and weekend activities together, including obstacle courses and other ways to build their skills as part of the cadet training program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a pleasure to deliver that $100,000 worth of funding. I very much look forward to welcoming our very first cadets in the very near future to the Brookfield cadet unit and to helping to see those values instilled in even more young people within the Ryan electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I thank the member for Ryan for his motion and I'm pleased to support it. The ADF cadet program is a community-based youth development program focused on leadership and team building. At a time when other youth development programs are declining, the cadets remain a popular, respected and reputable youth program. The cadet program has been successful in appealing to a diverse audience, attracting a high ratio of young women into its ranks, as well as Australians from culturally diverse backgrounds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For our part, Labor supported legislative changes, following the 2015 first principles review of Defence, to provide a clearer legal framework for the cadets. These changes established the cadets as a volunteer-based youth development organisation and enhanced the administrative oversight of cadets. A future Labor government will continue to support the cadets as an important youth development program, while avoiding an excessive administrative burden on the volunteers who make this program possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are about 28,000 cadets currently enrolled in three cadet programs; about 4,200 officers, instructors and approved helpers who supervise and support these young people; and 584 ADF cadet units across the states and territories. I've had the privilege of engaging with a number of cadet units in and around the electorate of Blair, both Army and Navy cadet units in Ipswich, up at Milford Street; in Springfield as well, with the member for Oxley; and the Air Force cadet unit at RAAF Base Amberley, the largest Air Force base in Australia, in Ipswich in my electorate. I want to take this opportunity to commend all our ADF Cadets and recognise the great work of the volunteer cadet leaders and staff, many of whom are parents or former cadets or veterans themselves, who give up their time to mentor these young people. Indeed, one of my electorate staff, Tyler Brennan, is a former cadet and now a cadet instructor. Thank you, Tyler, for the work you do with the cadets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cadets are an important source of defence recruitment for the ADF, with many going on to serve in a permanent ADF capacity or in the reserves. We on this side recognise this and the important role of the cadets and of a commitment to their continuity and growth. An Albanese Labor government will ensure a vibrant and well-equipped cadet program into the future. This is critical because, really, in many ways the current government has failed when it comes to the recruitment and retention of defence personnel. The cadets provide a conduit to the ADF, as youth sporting teams do to the NRL, the AFL, the AFLW, the A-League or any other elite sporting competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest Defence annual report shows that in 2020-21 Defence met only 90 per cent of the permanent force recruitment targets, and we know it has failed to meet the <span style="font-style:italic;">2016 Defence white paper</span> targets every year since 2015-16. At the same time the <span style="font-style:italic;">2020 Defence strategic update</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">2020 Force structure plan</span> showed that workforce costs are set to fall as a percentage of the defence budget while capability acquisitions will rise. In other words, investment in defence people and defence jobs is significantly lower than spending on capability and procurement. Given the government is failing to meet its current recruitment targets and that personnel shortages are already impacting the ADF, this could become a pressing defence capability issue in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2020, as part of the defence strategic update, the government promised to deliver a new defence workforce strategy in the following year, 2021. Well, 2021 came and went, and they failed to release it. Now we hear that the government will release the defence strategic workforce plan in early 2022, a year late. We understand it has been delayed by the new AUKUS agreement between Australia, the UK and the USA. That's disappointing. It puts, obviously, national security issues front and centre. Of course, there's no guarantee the government is on track to meet the current white paper target of 62,400 personnel, so we need to see the new workforce plan as soon as possible if we're going to have enough people, both permanent and reserve, to operate the ADF.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talk a big game when it comes to defence, but the reality is they have failed when it comes to not only defence capability and major acquisitions but recruiting and retaining enough ADF personnel to keep this country safe now and in the future. For nine years they have had no credible plan to grow the ADF. That's where the cadets come in. We commend the cadets. They play a key role in the pathway to ADF recruitment. I commend the work they do. I thank them for what they do. I thank the instructors and helpers in the cadet units around the country. Labor will continue to support this important youth development program.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I join my colleague the member for Blair in congratulating the cadets across our country. Bendigo, which is in my electorate, is an old town that has a long defence history. We too are home to Army cadets, Air Force cadets and Navy cadets. We see them each and every Anzac Day. They play an important role not just at Anzac Day events but at a number of other events that happen. Our RSLs quite regularly call upon our cadets to participate, help and raise the flag at their activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cadets are critical, as others have said, in providing an opportunity and pathway to young people who might be interested in a career in the ADF. They do so much more than introduce young people to our Australian Defence Force opportunities. They also provide young people with an opportunity to come together to learn leadership skills, participate in team activities and be engaged in a really proactive and positive environment. You are part of a team when you're part of the cadets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all young people are active in sport and not all young people are active in theatre. Cadets provide young people an opportunity to be involved in another activity after school. It's not for everyone, but some people really connect with it. Some make friends for life through being involved with the cadets, regardless of whether they go on to a defence career or not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been particularly hard for young people in all of our electorates but particularly those in Victoria over the last few years. I give a special shout-out to the people in my electorate, including the cadets, who haven't been able to gather like they usually do. There haven't been a lot of activities. Our Anzac services have been pared back because of COVID. They haven't been able to gather regularly on their parade nights, because of social-distancing requirements, or they have had to do it via Zoom. One young cadet said to me that, after having schooling via Zoom all day the last thing they wanted to do was cadets via Zoom. It missed the point of why they would gather in person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a challenging two years for these young people and all young people. Last year I spoke to our year 12s, who were getting close to graduation. They were in year 11 when they were doing homeschooling. For most of year 12 they did homeschooling. I asked them what their plans and hopes were for the future. It was also to offer them an apology. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Those final two years of schooling are such a rite of passage. There's a plan from day one about what your final two years looks like, and so many of our young people just didn't get that opportunity. School formals looked different. Exams looked different. Being able to get together and do the regular extracurricular activities at school looked different. A number of them deferred their studies. They said that they weren't going to study this year and that they were going to look for other opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think that, when we're talking about our cadets, we need to talk more broadly about young people in Australia and we need to work out what we're offering a generation of teenagers and people in their early 20s—a generation of younger people that, because of COVID, have missed out on so much of what the rest of us got to do. Yes, it's different in states like WA and Queensland. But in states like Victoria and New South Wales, where we were subject to a lot of changes around what we could do, this is a generation that didn't get those rite-of-passage moments like the rest of us. This is a generation that may not have got the marks that they wanted and may not be studying. This is a generation for whom homeownership is looking more and more unlikely. This is a generation who, it looks like, will have four or five career changes, maybe even more of that.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the more that our government can do to create opportunities for younger Australians, the better. The more cadet programs leading into apprenticeship programs within the Defence Force, the better. The more we look at expanding out and paying a proper wage to people who might want to work in conservation, the better. There's an opportunity for us here in this place to really think about how we can support that generation of young people, who've really borne the brunt of a lot of what's happened with COVID. I couldn't imagine being 18 or 19 and having to go through the last two years of what a lot of our young people in Australia have. They should be congratulated, but they should also be listened to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm keen to hear more from our cadets about what they'd like to see in the future. I'd like to thank them for what they do. We couldn't have the events that we have in Bendigo without their service. I'd also like to encourage any young person thinking about it to give it a go. You might meet a best friend, you might have a career in the ADF and you might have some good fun along the way. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've moved is a motion for a ban on the export of oil. There could be nothing more illogical and stupid than to allow 27 per cent of our requirements in diesel and petrol to go overseas, which we then buy back. It goes overseas to Singapore and to South Korea. If China places an embargo—'Oh, they wouldn't do that!' Well, talk to the Germans in World War I, when Winston Churchill made sure the Anglos had control of every drop of oil on earth. The Germans decided they wouldn't be a third-rate power and they went to war. As to World War II, we all know what forced Japan into the war—an oil embargo. As a young man—I think I was 21 years of age—I joined up because we were at war with Indonesia. Over what? Borneo oil. But this government has no supply of oil whatsoever in the country. They can't use their own Australian oil because it can't be processed in our refineries, except for about three per cent of it. So if China embargoes our fuel, the whole thing becomes a mockery. There is no way that you can move one single soldier from that point to that point. So we're moving this bill. We're not talking about it; we're doing something about it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to reducing CO2—well, quite frankly, I think the things that have been done in Australia are a farce. I've always been one for reducing CO2. But if you convert waste to diesel, that's 33 per cent of your oil needs. And they're already doing it: Southern Oil are already doing it in Wagga Wagga and Gladstone. It's not pie in the sky. The Prime Minister has visited; the Premier of Queensland has visited. So they're already doing it. The Germans did it for the last two years of the war—waste to diesel; pyrolysis—by the Fischer-Tropsch method.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, what we are proposing is that all government vehicles in metropolitan areas be electric; that would extend our fuel supply but also would mean that we're not dependent upon the fuel supply for at least three or four per cent of our vehicles. They are to be made in Australia by an Australian-owned company. Now wouldn't that be something! Wouldn't that be something, if we were actually constructing motor vehicles in Australia again! Did we make good motor cars? Seventy-two per cent of the market was held by Australia.</span>

As to renewables, of course, no less a person than Al Gore in <span style="font-style:italic;">An Inconvenient Truth</span> said that the first answer to the world's CO2 problems is ethanol.

On fuel: we are at 28 per cent, whereas, in America, they're almost totally self-reliant now as to fuel. They are sick of fighting wars. You had World War I; you had World War II; you had the Indonesian war; you had the Arab wars, which just seemed to go on forever; you had the Gulf War and the Afghanistan war. Let's stop fighting the wars and supply our own petrol so that we don't have to fight the wars, and, if we get into one, we can defend ourselves. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  I'd like to thank the members for Kennedy and Clark for bringing this debate forward today. Fuel security has always been important, but these are probably the most fraught times for this since the seventies. Aside from the more protectionist nature of trade today and the implications on tariffs at international borders, the pandemic has tightened supply lines, and a single container ship wedged in the Suez has shown us how dependent global trade is on a few small choke-points. This debate really does matter. It also couldn't be more timely. On the weekend, I saw fuel at $2.28 in Sydney. Clearly, fuel shocks are real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I don't agree with all of the protectionist measures in this motion, there are certainly some elements which are critical and should be addressed immediately by the government. The call to stockpile six months fuel supply is vital to ensure we can keep moving, even in a crisis. I am pleased to see that the government is acting on this. We are securing a baseline level of key transport fuels to be kept onshore to act as a buffer against supply shocks through the implementation of a minimum stockholding obligation. This will see a 40 per cent increase in our local diesel stocks. But, when prices stabilise again, we must invest in fuels to ensure that we have domestic storage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the need for storage, sovereign manufacturing capabilities are also essential, which is why the government is ensuring that we have access to the fuel we need to keep Australia moving. We have already locked in Australia's refining capacity and its 1,250 employees through the landmark Fuel Security Act. This means that the Ampol refinery in Brisbane and the Viva Energy refinery in Geelong will both remain in operation until at least mid-2027. In fact, the Viva Energy refinery at Geelong in Victoria has extended this commitment until 30 June 2028, one year more than the minimum required period under the Fuel Security Act 2021. Locking in our refineries is a matter of national security, of Australia's sovereignty and our self-sufficiency at critical times, our resilience, and our resilience as a nation. It means that we continue to have the ability to refine domestic crude oil in times of emergency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing in our refineries through the fuel security services payment, which recognises the vital role that refineries play in our long-term fuel security. The payments are designed to ensure that refineries are supported in downtimes, not when they are performing well. Due to reduced demand, the pandemic resulted in a surplus of fuel products, particularly jet fuel. With the demand dropping by over 80 per cent, refineries faced challenges in reducing the production of petrol and jet fuel while maintaining diesel production. The first quarter of the fuel security services payment has now been finalised by the government, with payments well below the maximum support available. For quarter 1, 2021-22, Ampol will not receive any payments, as their payment rate is zero cents per litre. The results demonstrate the fuel security payment system is working as intended, with refiners only receiving support from the government when refinery market conditions are poor. In the case of Ampol, their margins have rallied to such an extent that they do not need any support. Viva's margins are also improving, with the payments well below the maximum available. This is the economically responsible way to support domestic industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to see the government has remained committed to domestic refining. It is not too long ago that most states had their own refinery, and, while the companies operating them saw business sense in moving offshore, it is good to see that the government has acted to ensure that not everybody has left the market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Australia's fuel supplies have remained secure and affordable through the pandemic, we know we need to shield Australians from potential shocks in the future and enhance our national security in the process. Our economy relies heavily on energy and liquid fuels, and this will continue to grow. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  Let there be no misunderstanding: this country must achieve net zero carbon emissions as soon as possible, and by that I mean 2035, not 2050. It also means that this country must not invest in any new oil, gas or coal projects, but it does mean we need to fast-track our renewable energy industries, including fast-tracking the development of an Indigenous electric vehicle industry. But none of those ambitions and needs let the government off the hook that, right now, and for the immediate future, we need energy security when it comes to fuels, oils and lubricants. Yes, let's get rid of them as soon as we can. But right now, tomorrow, next month, next year, we must have absolute fuel security when it comes to our carbon based fuels, oils and lubricant. What have we got instead? This country imports 90 per cent of our refined fuel—90 percent coming from overseas—and much of our 68-day stock that we claim to have in our possession is, in fact, in the United States of America and on ships at sea. In other words, we have bugger-all fuel reserves within our borders, on our land. In fact, as of November last year we had only 54 days of jet turbine fuel, 24 days of petroleum and 20 days of diesel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the point again: fuel in America is useless in a crisis and fuel on ships is potentially useless in a crisis, in particular, when we have only four refineries in this country and two are closing. All this is happening at a time of real, genuine international drama. What if there's another war in the Middle East? What if there's a war over Taiwan? What if there's a war in Ukraine? I notice that even today, just a couple of hours ago, Minister Dan Tehan warned that supply chain issues may worsen with a Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is real. What if there are industrial catastrophes in the oil refineries of Singapore or South Korea? These are all potential scenarios. These are all real threats to the importation of fuel to this country. So why on earth we don't have at least 60 days supply of jet fuel, of petrol, of aviation gasoline, of all the oils and lubricants, beggars belief and is a failure of governance in this country by a series of governments of both colours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the best solution to this is absolute self-reliance through renewable energy. That's what we actually need, and we have an abundance of these renewable energy sources that we can be bringing online far more quickly than we are already doing. In fact, Australia is genuinely a renewable energy powerhouse with remarkable resources like our wind, our solar, hydro, the potential for geothermal, wave and tide. There are also the emerging technologies that are on the drawing board and technologies that we can't even fathom just yet, ones that we will discover over the next several years if we get behind these industries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose one of the key points of this motion by the remarkable member for Kennedy is that we need government to be involved in every way possible by investing in these new industries and new technologies. I think paragraph (7) of the motion is very important, that Australia move to establish the manufacturing of electric vehicles:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's achievable. We have the know-how, we have the money, we have the resources. We just don't have the political will and the incentives to make it happen. That's all we need. If this country is going to achieve net zero—I hope by 2035—and 100 per cent reliance on renewable energy then we need the government to be more involved with regulations, with funding, with incentives. I reckon a great start is a target of 100 per cent local, state and federal government vehicles and buses by 2035. Heavens, all those levels of government rely on federal funding and so we have the levers at our disposal to force them to make it happen. </span>
