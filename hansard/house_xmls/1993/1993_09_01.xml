         â€”As stated by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in his second reading speech on 18 August, most of the amendments contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 flow from recommendations made by the commissioners of ATSIC in February 1993 following their review of the act. The coalition supports the thrust of these proposed changes. After all, they respond to a number of concerns expressed by the opposition parties in relation to the conduct and accountability of regional councils.

         They also broadly reflect sentiments contained in the coalition's policy at the last federal election which, among other things, signalled the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in the decisions that affect their lives and determine their local priorities, and the intention to decentralise the ATSIC operations and devolve to the maximum extent possible its administrative decision making to the regions.

         The coalition's policy on ATSIC also expresses an absolute requirement for focus on tangible benefits on the ground as a result of programs rather than the present focus on timely distribution of funds. It also has a requirement for the decision making to be open and transparent for organisations receiving government money to provide services in an efficient and equitable manner, and accountability in all levels of service delivery.

         This amendment bill is the second in a three-part legislative package. The minister has advised that the third package of amendments will be introduced later in the sittings and will deal with arrangements for the Torres Strait and with streamlining the financial provisions of the principal act. It will also grant the Office of Evaluation and Audit powers to evaluate and audit regional councils, Aboriginal hostels, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, and ATSIC funded corporations. While the coalition will certainly look to this third legislative package with a great deal of interest, I will be concentrating solely on the measures before us today.

         The principal act currently allows regional councils to establish advisory committees to provide advice in relation to the performance of their functions. Such an advisory committee may include members of the regional councils. The proposal will entitle future members of the advisory committees to receive remuneration and allowances for their services, and provides that such members will hold office on terms and conditions determined by ATSIC.

         The proposed amendment will also strengthen the obligations and guidelines for regional councillors.

Declarations of pecuniary interest must be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

         Provisions add to the list of circumstances that make a person ineligible to stand for election or be elected as a member of a regional council.

         Changes in relation to electoral boundaries will enable the introduction of a ward system for regional council elections and allow for the reduced number of regional councils. The introduction of a system of electoral wards is, as I understand it, a measure in response to concerns that the reduction in the number of regional councils might lessen the opportunity for representation by minority groups. Such a system is not unlike the ward system for local government elections in operation in Australia today.

Finally, there is provision in this bill for the deferral of the 1993 regional council elections in the Torres Strait islands to bring them into line with elections due under Queensland's Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984.

         The coalition parties appreciate the necessity for the smooth passage of this bill to enable the institution of measures vital to the ATSIC elections to be held in early December 1993. We have considered all the measures which, as acknowledged earlier, respond to a number of concerns for accountability and effective monitoring of federal funding through ATSIC. It is recognised that these measures make provisions for increased accountability and strengthen the ability of ATSIC to monitor its own affairs. However, notwithstanding our recognition of these genuine moves to respond to accountability concerns in so far as ATSIC is concerned, there are further question marks which the coalition sees hanging over the $1 billion-plus annual funding now directed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs; funding which aims to reverse the great disadvantage which currently besets the majority of indigenous Australians. We have to ask the question: what progress are we making?

         A recent report on maternal deaths in Australia in 1988-90 stated that the incidence of direct deaths amongst Aboriginal women was the highest since 1972. Today, 20 years on, the incidence of maternal death for Aboriginal women through pregnancy and childbirth is eight times higher than for non-Aboriginal women. As recently as one month ago, the federal Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, was moved to state:

        Just over a month ago, at a tropical diseases conference in Darwin, Dr Christine Phillips highlighted research from central Australia in which 374 Aboriginal people with diagnosed diabetes were monitored between 1984 and 1991. During that seven-year period, a staggering 130 of themâ€”60 men and 70 womenâ€”had died. Another report, by Professor John Mathews, Director of the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, told the same conference that nearly all rural Aboriginal infants at six weeks of age were permanently infected with harmful bacteria.

         , that in the last 20 years there has been a reduction of 60 per cent in infant and maternal deaths and a reduction in the impact of many infectious diseases. We can claim that for the non-indigenous population also. The real bottom line in examining all these performance indicators is that, in relation to the rest of the Australian population, the figures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians show them to be a seriously disadvantaged group. This is totally unacceptable.

         It is clear that federal funding allocated to address the abysmal living standards of a large number of Aboriginal people in Australia still is not hitting the mark.

       <para>
        I must stress that this amendment is not introduced as an ATSIC bashing exercise, but as a move which ATSIC should welcome and support.

         The coalition is aware of the criticisms directed towards ATSIC; most notable is the recent expressions by Ms Pat O`Shane who said, `On every social indicator the position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders has deteriorated over the past decade in the lifetime of ATSIC'. This is not fair or balanced criticism on any count. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was proclaimed on 7 February 1990. ATSIC commenced operations on 5 March 1990, just 3 1/2 years ago. Ms O'Shane should check her facts. At that time, ATSIC's statement of purpose was that it would work towards the achievement of a situation of justice and equity in the longer term where Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have sufficient economic and social status to enjoy fundamental civil, social, and economic rights.

         While appreciating the recognition in this statement of the long-term view, it has opened up a question as to whether vital areas such as health and housing should be the sole responsibility of ATSIC. This question has also been put to the shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), during his recent travels to various Aboriginal communities around Australia. Professor John Mathews, whom I quoted earlier, also made this point recently: `We know that chronic bronchitis and damaged lungs in later life are a sequel to childhood infections that aren't treated properly. These bacterial infections undermine a person's health later in life. Death rates from pneumonia in people with damaged lungs are very high in middle age and that is probably a consequence of what's happened in childhood'. The yardstick by which one measures the effectiveness of programs, particularly health programs, is also significant. The 10 years offered as a yardstick by Ms O'Shane is, I believe, an unrealistic indicator.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A further sad commentary on all this lies with Professor Mathews' two statements quoted previously. The prognosis for today's six-week-old rural Aboriginal infants who are permanently infected with harmful bacteria will be realised in their middle age. This is a national shame, and it requires a national effort to combat it. The coalition welcomes the health minister's interest in becoming involved, and it has no reason to doubt that he is genuinely anxious to do something tangible about the poor living standards of indigenous people.

         Finally, I remind the House that the coalition's policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders emphasises the need for clearly defined objectives for the achievement and improvement in Aboriginal health, in the provision of housing and infrastructure, in Aboriginal education, and in Aboriginal economic development. Benchmarks must be set for assessing these four practical and vital indicators of human wellbeing  and quality of life. The coalition believes it is essential that an independent review be made of the ability of the ATSIC structure to realistically deal with the multifarious demands required to be met to reduce the disadvantages of Australia's indigenous peoples.

         â€”I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. This legislation furthers the reform process of the ATSIC political structure, particularly as it applies in the regions. This legislation advances the effectiveness and integrity of this body, both within and outside the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. ATSIC has built an impressive record over its three years of operation. This legislation will enable the political and administrative arms of the commission to operate much more efficiently in achieving its aims and objectives.

         It is important for all honourable members to appreciate that this is very much an evolving process of self-determination and self-management by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. When the original ATSIC legislation was enacted, the concept of giving the power to Aboriginal and Islander people to determine their own priorities and manage their own affairs was a new idea for non-indigenous Australia. Many thought it would not work. There was much scepticism and some fierce opposition from some sections of the Aboriginal community as well as others in the political spectrum.

         ATSIC had a very stormy gestation and its birth was difficult. The decision by many to boycott the first elections for regional councillors and commissioners did not cause stillbirth as some had hoped. Three years later we have a healthy developing organisation that grows stronger, wiser and more proficient with each passing day. There are of course many things still to learn and many improvements that can be made to strengthen the decision making processes and to provide greater control over funding decisions in regions.

         In using the analogy of the birth and growth of a child to describe the evolving development of ATSIC, I do not seek in any way to be patronising or paternalistic in my approach to the process of self-determination for Aboriginal and Islander Australians. Far from it. I am strongly committed to advancing the process of self-government for indigenous people. Rather, I seek to emphasise that all of usâ€”members of the parliament and the government, workers in the bureaucracy both in ATSIC and in other departments, Aboriginal and Islander people and the rest of the Australian populationâ€”are on a sharp learning curve in shaping this new concept within our political and administrative structures. It is a radical new concept, untried anywhere else in the world in the fashion of our model, and all participants in the process need time to grow with it and to reshape it as it evolves.

         ATSIC does have limitations. It has made some mistakes over the past three years. There are still areas where improvements are required. Many Aboriginal and Islander people do get frustrated with some of the bureaucratic processes that are used. Many would like to have a lot more control now over some of the national programs and over expenditure on Aboriginal needs done by other departments. But all of these issues will be worked through and will be improved if we keep our eye on the long-term objective and do not allow ourselves to be sidetracked or become short sighted or too desperate.

         I am disappointed that a quorum was called because I was just about to praise the opposition for the role it played in Aboriginal and Islander affairs. I might have to withdraw those words. In the last three years a hallmark of Aboriginal and Islander administration has been the spirit of cooperation between the government and the opposition. Unfortunately, that spirit of cooperation has not been demonstrated in the House today through those opposite interrupting people who are trying to make some very important points on a very important area of public administration.

         The task for ATSIC over the first three years of its existence has been to shape a political and bureaucratic structure which enables Aboriginal and Islander people to determine their needs and priorities and to target resources to those needs with strategic programs that they are responsible for. That task has been made much easier by the cooperation and support of the opposition in this parliament. I acknowledge the very important role the former opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), played in achieving this.

         I welcome the continuation of that policy under the wise counsel of my friend, who is absent, the current opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). Too often in the past, the administration of Aboriginal and Islander affairs has been used for cheap point scoring and very destructive political agendas. A great deal of hysteria had been built up among the non-Aboriginal Australian community about allegations of gross mismanagement, corruption, excessive waste of resources and accusations that indigenous Australians were being given unfair advantages in the allocation of government support.

         These continuing allegations built up considerable tensions, caused significant disruption to the administration of Aboriginal needs and led to racism and abuses of the rights of many indigenous people. Those processes have very much diminished in the past three years. We have been able to operate in a much more cooperative and cohesive way in tackling the isolated examples of waste or mismanagement without the climate of hysteria and hatred that existed previously. The positive relationships between the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and his opposition counterparts have been a significant factor in this achievement.

         The other very important factor in achieving constructive reform in the administration of Aboriginal affairs has been the excellent leadership provided by the Chairperson of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue. Lois is a woman of outstanding character, ability and compassion. She has overseen the establishment and development of the new commission with determination and intellectual rigour, and also with personal qualities of calmness, sincerity and understanding of the complexities of the needs of the individuals for whose welfare she is responsible. I do not believe ATSIC would have had the stature it has today without Lois's contribution as chairperson.

         Without wishing to pre-empt the final report of the standing committee in its current inquiry into the access and equity strategy, I would like to outline some of the ways in which Aboriginal and Islander people believe ATSIC needs to be further strengthened. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) goes to the very essence of the problem ATSIC has. There is a misconception in the Australian community, within both the indigenous and non-indigenous populations, that ATSIC is responsible for the totality of Aboriginal affairs. That misconception is creating enormous problems for ATSIC and Aboriginal people.

         Many Aboriginal people turn up at ATSIC regional offices expecting ATSIC to be able to help them with a whole host of areas that it does not have responsibility for. The fact is that mainstream government departmentsâ€”whether we are talking about the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Department of Employment, Education and Training or the CES; whatever department we might be talking about at the Commonwealth, state or local government levelâ€”have prime responsibility for delivering services to Aboriginal people as well as to other Australians.

         Unfortunately, I do not believe that those departments are delivering those services in the way they should.

         There is a view and a wish amongst Aboriginal people on ATSIC's regional councils that they should have a much greater say in the way in which these other mainstream departments deliver their services, but that is not currently the case. They do not have a say in the way in which the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services delivers its services to Aboriginal people; they do not have any say in the way in which state housing commissions might allocate housing to Aboriginal and urban communities where Aboriginal people might live; they do not have a say in the way in which state health departments provide hospitals and other community health services to Aboriginal people as well as to other Australians. Those are the areas where we have great problems.

         It is a misconception to be blaming ATSIC for the fact that we have not been able to make significant inroads into health and education issues for Aboriginal people. ATSIC's responsibility is to complement mainstream government departments. It is there to top up. It is there to identify where there are some specific areas of neglect from those mainstream departments and to put some extra money in to help those communities. It is not there to provide prime services. It is there to give a voice to Aboriginal and Islander people so that they can identify their needs in that area, and to say to those mainstream departments, `This is what you should be doing. This is the major area of concern that we have in our area, and we have real health problems'. That is clearly understood by the government and the opposition.

         There are incredibly poor health statistics for the Aboriginal and Islander people in this country. But it is not ATSIC's responsibility to do the job alone. ATSIC's responsibility is to work with those government departments at state, Commonwealth and local government levels in order to identify strategic ways in which to tackle those primary health problems. Officers of government departments have a responsibility in this area and they should be talking to ATSIC and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander political leaders in the community. They should be asking, `What strategies do we need to undertake together to achieve these improvements in health, education and housing needs?'. That is the real challenge.

         Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are Australians. They deserve their share of mainstream government expenditure on their needs. ATSIC's responsibility is to coordinate that service delivery in its regions. Where there are pockets of need that are not being addressed, ATSIC has to ensure that it comes in with a specific program and assists the Aboriginal organisations to work in the communities.

         The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) is part of an evolutionary process for ATSIC. It is giving a bit more power to the regional councils. It is tidying up a few problems that have been identified in the last three years. It is part of an ongoing process that I think we are going to be going through for the next 20 or 30 years in this place: that is, making minor amendments as needs emerge, as Aboriginal and Islander people raise with us their needs for further change in the political structure. This parliament and the people of Australia have to recognise that ATSIC is here to stay. Our challenge is to make ATSIC a very strong and effective organisation and to give it the skills to work with all the other government departments to achieve its real objective. That will lead to a massive improvement in the quality of life for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country.

         â€”In rising to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2), I do so with some deep grief and disappointment at what has happened in Queensland. Over 30 per cent of Australia's people of Aboriginal descent live in Queenslandâ€”arguably over 40 per cent of people of Aboriginal descent live in Queensland. In the history of Queensland there has only been one change of government in 100 years. For the first 60 of those 100 years the Australian Labor Party was in office. That was the party of socialism and humanity. Let us look at the record of the laws that existed in Queensland when the Liberal-National Party coalition took office in 1957. A person of Aboriginal descent who worked for a wage did not have his wage paid to him; it was paid to the Director of Native Affairs whose local officers were the police officers. The Aboriginal worker had to go along and speak to the police officers and tell them what he wanted the money for and they would give him sufficient money to cover that particular need. I leave to the imagination of the members of the House how pleasant that function would be.

         When a mustering camp or droving trip finished, everyone went and drank some of their earnings at the hotel. But of course the black ringer could not, firstly, because he would not have any money; and, secondly, because black people in the state of Queensland were not allowed to drink in hotels by law. So when a droving trip finished, the whites would go to the pub together as mates but the black people would be excluded.

         The worst law of all was the removal order. An officer of the Department of Native Affairs could simply pluck someone of Aboriginal or part-Aboriginal descent off the streetâ€”at the officer's whim and discretion, with no appeal systemâ€”and send that person to what was affectionately called a reserve. When a person went to a reserve, he was totally in the hands of and under the direction of the superintendent.

         `Superintendent' was the word used in the act, and that same word was used in the act with respect to gaols in the state of Queensland. The superintendent on a reserve had powers similar to the superintendent of a gaol, except that the powers of the former were more extensive. He could give an orderâ€”the act did not specify what the order could be; it could be `brush my shoes' or `mow my lawn' or any order whatsoeverâ€”and if that order was disobeyed the person so ordered could be punished. In fact, the superintendent could punish that person in any event; he could, at his discretion and without any appeal, impose a punishment.

         The removal order allowed the superintendent to apply corporal punishment. I will cite a case. A gentleman who was not 50 years of age came to see me when I was state minister. He showed me the marks on his back from when he had been tied to a telephone pole at Cherbourg and belted with a strap. The whole community was ordered out to watch this occur. This man was less than 50 years of ageâ€”that is what he claimed, and he did not look more than that. That is what happened to him. One of my senior officers standing behind the man, and who was in fact from Cherbourg, nodded to me that this had actually occurred in our day and age. I am not talking about past history here.

         â€”This Johnny-come-lately to Queensland does not understand what happened in the last six years. He has not been there long enough. In the last six years, we decided to take two initiatives which were unique in Australia. One initiative was to give the people on the reserve areas in Queensland ownership of the seven million acres of those reserve areas. It is not ownership as in the Northern Territory, where nothing can take place on 50 per cent of the land without the matter being referred to the government in Canberra for permission. This is absolutely, completely fee simple. Maybe as a lawyerâ€”and the honourable member for Leichhardt did not enjoy a very good reputation as a lawyer either, let me tell himâ€”the honourable member would understand what fee simple means. It means freehold land.

         The only difference between title and freehold land is that land title could not be sold to outsiders. The land could be sold only to community residents.

Without loans from the banks, no community can growâ€”whether it be the Australian community or a community at Kowanyama.

         Our second initiative was to grant what the people call self-managementâ€”local government, as most of us would know it. As with everything else, the ALP claimed it was not self-management. There was a caseâ€”the R. v. Smallwood caseâ€”involving a gentleman who was a member of the land council at Yarrabah. It was decided in that case that proper, complete local government powers had been handed to the properly constituted Yarrabah community council.

         That is not quite true because far more extensive powers were granted to the councils. Those councils also had extensive control over the police force and various other activities.

         That is the situation in Queensland. The seven million acres are no longer owned by the land councils or in private ownershipâ€”because the councils had the machinery means to pass the land on to private ownership. All of that seven million acres is now owned by the government. The absolute towering stupidity of the eight white officials that drafted the legislation has been such that the only way the black people can get at that legislation is to prove tribal relationship. That is very helpful in Yarrabah because there are only about 50 people in a town with a population of 2,000 to 3,000 that are of the original tribe! At Cherbourg, there are about 12 from the original tribe. In fact, almost all of the reserves in Queensland have virtually none of the original members of the tribe on the land. So the legislation has not only taken the land away from these people in the short term but also ensures that the majority of the people living on the reserves can never have that land.

         Even in the short term and even if one is a member of the original tribe, land ownership is still very difficult to prove because one has to mount a campaign in the courts and through legal tribunals, which of course lines the pockets of the Aboriginal legal aid lawyers who have parasited and bloodsucked off the people of Aboriginal descent in a most dreadful manner. The last legal aid lawyer in Mount Isa was being paid $72,000 a year, and I am told he could not get a job for $26,000 a year as an articled clerk in Melbourne. I do not know whether that is true but I am fairly certain it is, because he most certainly did not do too well when he got out of the job.

The ALP government in Canberra has sent up a white public servant who has come in as a development officer and is undermining you and taking control of the running of the council'. He said, `How did you know that?'. I said, `Because they've done it in every single community in Queensland. Our efforts to put real power in the hands of the black people and to force them, even if they don't want to, to make the decisions themselves are being undermined by another group of white parasites, the so-called do-gooders. And I tell you what: my experience is that the do-gooders have done bloody well for themselves, bloody well'. Excuse my language, Mr Deputy Speaker.

         This young man, the white officer there, Darvel Longâ€”this white parasite put in there by the ALP government, the socialists and the paternalistsâ€”started going to the shire chairman and saying, `This particular person doesn't really understand some things. You could get yourself into trouble here. I think I'd better take over the running of this function or that function'. As he started taking over the running of all of these functions, the confidence of the council in its own shire clerk was undermined more and more. Thanks to the degradation imposed upon these people by 70 years of ALP rule, these people do not have very high self-esteem.

         Our policy created a situation in which only six of the 28 councils in Queensland attracted any bad report or comment from the Auditor-General. This year, of the 28 councils, only six did not have a bad report from the Auditor-General. In other words, whereas previously almost every council was doing its job as well as any shire council in Queensland, we now have a situation in which virtually not one is doing so because the accountability provisions were removed.

         What I do know is that this bill further enhances self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. The section 26 review which brought about the changes provides proof of this. I travel among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities more than most members of this House. The message that I get, which has been put by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), is that there are problems with ATSIC; people do concede that. After all, as the honourable member for Moreton said, it is not an organisation that has been with us for very long. When one asks Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, `Okay, there are problems with ATSIC; do you want to go back to the old DAA days?', they say, `Oh, no, we don't want that at all'.

         The primary focus of this bill is not necessarily on the commission itself but on the regional councils. I found it strange that the honourable member for Kennedy would choose to make a comment about people being governed from Brisbane, or even from Canberra, when the very point of this legislation before the House is to devolve more power to the regional councils. The regional councils are, by definition, in the regions.

ATSIC is structured so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a say in government decisions that affect their lives. The way in which the commission gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a voice, as we know, is through the election of community representatives to the regional councils. ATSIC has only been in operation since Monday, 5 March 1990; that is, just over three years. In that period, the regional councils have played a critical role in determining funding priorities and planning in local areas.

The election process to be followed for the regional councils will be the introduction of a ward system for those regions where it is considered to be desirable. I understand this legislation provides for the minister to make that determination with advice from the regional councils. But I must emphasiseâ€”and it is very important for the House to noteâ€”that in future, the intention is that the ward system and those boundaries be determined by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. The only reason that that is not introduced in this legislation is the time factor that is involved in the section 26 review. We are then faced with the next elections. Therefore, that leaves no time for those ward systems to be determined by Aboriginal people. In the future, they will be so determined.

         The reforms in this bill reflect the fact that the responsibilities of regional councils have been progressively increased. In my electorate, the Cairns and district regional council, the Peninsula regional council, the Torres Strait regional council, the Yarrabah regional council and the Palm Island regional council have been making more of the decisions about how funds are appropriated to ATSIC and how they are distributed.

I sat with the committee during hearings in Rockhampton, Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, and Cairns earlier this month. I was disturbed to hear evidence in all three places that ATSIC regional councils are still having problems with some federal, state and local government agencies. For the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Commission to work, the power of the parliament has to be vested in the regional councils, and this must be recognised by all levels of government. I believe the provisions in the bill passed earlier this year, along with the reforms in this bill, will help strengthen the role of regional councils.

         The first bill included provisions dealing with two of the recommendations of the Aboriginal and Torres Islander Commission relating to regional councils. The regional council structure was strengthened by reducing the numbers of councils. As at the next round of elections due later this year, the number of regional councils will be reduced from 60 to 36. This will be achieved by providing for full-time appointments of regional council chairpersons. Therefore, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate will participate in the ATSIC election process for the Queensland far north and communities regional council, the Queensland north regional council and the Torres Strait regional council. Because the act requires that regional council elections be held before the end of this year, it is essential that those who wish to stand for election are aware of the new rules that will govern the elections and operations of the regional councils.

I have the pleasure of having regular contact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the Cape York Peninsula, the Torres Strait, Yarrabah and in and around the city of Cairns itself. I believe that the current regional councils are deservedly going down in history as trailblazers for the cause of self-determination within ATSIC.

         It is difficult for honourable members who come from suburban electorates to imagine the difficulties. The honourable member for Kennedy referred to the difficulties that people in remote areas have in dealing with bureaucracies thousands of kilometres away in Brisbane or Cairns. The demolition of that southern based power has been very important for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Far North Queensland. That is especially so after the decades of control of every aspect of their lives by successive Queensland governments up to 1989, including the government in which the honourable member for the Kennedy was a minister. In this context, the empowerment of regional councils in Far North Queensland has been quite remarkable. I am confident that this package of amendments will further improve the ability of councillors to serve their constituents in the far north.

         When introducing the first package of amendments to the act, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Affairs announced that a series of workshops will be held to discuss the proposed changes, and one of the key matters to be discussed will be the offer of introducing a ward system. I am assured that there is widespread support for this idea. Again, it is very important to note that, in remote areas, distinct areas should get distinct representation. This legislation provides that. Given the level of support for the idea, as I have already indicated there will be a provision in the legislation for the subdivision of wards in time for this year's regional council elections.

It is their work that has put ATSIC in the position it is in now. It is their work that I praise, and for that reason I commend the bill to the House.

         The indigenous people of Australia have rights in this country. They have the right to have a proper health service provided to them. They have a right to access and equity to mainstream government services, yet evidence supports that they are not provided such access. They have a right to lead their lives without the input of paternalistic non-Aboriginal Australians, which holds back the development of their own culture and values. Frankly, the enormity of the current social issues disturbing the indigenous people are awesome.

         Back in 1992 the coalition first brought to the attention of the government the need to introduce the amendments outlined in this bill. The coalition, in its white paper of that year, noted:

        Currently there are 60 regional councils in Australia. This is an impossible number of councils to be adequately serviced by ATSIC.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the regional councils are to become the prime decision making body at program and project level it is essential that they have the best people on them and are adequately resourced and adequately serviced. The reduction in the number of regional councils is absolutely essential to ATSIC's future success and the implementation of these proposals. The smaller number of regional councils will allow those regional councils to be better serviced by existing ATSIC regional offices.

        Obviously, the coalition had flagged the need for revision of the management structure, and the government, to its rare credit, is taking up the advice we provided. It is no surprise that the major concern for many Australians is the use and misuse of public funds provided for ATSIC and whether those fund are bringing important advancements to the Aboriginal people. Although the reality is very different to community perceptions, it seems that the use of government money is being questioned by the community generally. As an example, the McCarrey report, released in the Western Australian parliament recently, reinforced the concerns of the community. The McCarrey report was a sad inditement of the performance of the Labor administration in that state over the last 10 years, and confirmed the ALP as a poor financial managerâ€”as, I guess, budgets one and two have indicated this week.

         It was interesting to note what it said about Aboriginal expenditure and operations. The report noted that government Aboriginal programs in Western Australia, both federal and state, were poorly administered, inappropriate and failed comprehensively to address underlying issues of the indigenous communities. In 1992-93, total federal and state expenditure in Western Australia was $288 million in addition to the $380 million associated with other mainstream Aboriginal programs. Despite these programs and the funds expended, the report was damning in stating that a broad range of social and economic statistics show that, despite these programs, Aborigines remain disadvantaged. The question then has to be: is ATSIC living up to the high expectations placed upon it by indigenous Australians and the wider community?

         I bring the attention of the House to two recommendations from the report, which the government would do well to recognise.

Secondly, it should encourage local government to become more involved in service delivery of mainstream services, community management and employment issues.

It can be considered that the current Aboriginal community has a mortality rate greater than a war zone as exists in some of the areas around the world at the moment. The community is actually at war with some of these health issues. Last week during my visits to Aboriginal communities with a few of my more compassionate colleagues of the other side we had discussions with many Aboriginal leaders.

         I certainly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). I think it is fair enough and reasonable that after some three years of operation an organisation of such vital importance to indigenous Australians should be subject to an external review. I know there was an internal review in February this year, but I tend to have some doubts about internal reviews, whether they are conducted by ATSIC, police departments or anybody else. I think it is appropriate that there should be a thorough and searching review of the operation of ATSIC. It is too important to the indigenous people of Australia not to have that review take place.

         I am concerned about the apparent lack of consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities on the legislation we are considering today. As late as yesterday afternoon I had a meeting with the chairperson and two other members of the Sydney regional council of ATSIC. They had not even received a copy of the bill we are debating, until it was given to them by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), yesterday morning. Quite frankly, this is absolutely outrageous. If we are to put legislation into this parliament concerning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, there should at least be the courtesy of consultation beforehand.

         In this bill we have a proposal to change the regional councils, to limit them in number and a number of other provisions. At the present time, regional councils are able to establish advisory committees, which may include members of the regional council. There can be remuneration and allowances for their services. We are now seeking with this bill to introduce some budget constraints on remuneration and allowances. I think that is fair enough. There should not be an open ticket with no limit.

         I also agree with the introduction of a ward system. That will be a more democratic way of electing members of regional councils. I am certainly aware of situations where, if there is one family group that is larger than the others, we do get a degree of ascendancy and dominance and views of other groups are not necessarily fairly represented. I think it is fair to say that there is a great deal of concern about the rights and the roles of advisory committees. Regional councils in effect only make recommendations and do not make decisions, yet if we go and talk to communities they see their regional council as being at the coalface. They do not realise that the regional council does not have the absolute authority to make the decision on where programs are to be allocated and where funding will go. I think it is probably fair to say that most people in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities think that their regional council has far more power than it actually has.

That may well be true, but I suggest that the honourable member for Capricornia should cast her arms a little wider and take in Queensland. After all, we have been waiting for three years for something to happen with the Torres Strait health strategy. We should also talk about South Australiaâ€”where we visited. All I am really saying is that it is probably not appropriate, in what we hope will continue to be a bipartisan area, to single out different state governments because all of them could be spearedâ€”to use an appropriate wordâ€”pretty well on this issue.

         I have spoken about the need for regional councils to be able to make decisions and I referred to Amata. I would like to make another point about Amata. In that community there is housing for the indigenous people and housing for the white people who work there as well. It was brought very forcefully to our attention that the houses of white Australiansâ€”teachers, health workers and othersâ€”have rainwater tanks, even though the bore water is apparently quite acceptable and potable. Black people living in that community do not have rainwater tanks. This is just one of those basic injustices that I think should appal every Australian. It is an indicator of the need for Australia as a community, as a nation, to take a greater interest in seeing that injustice and inequity are wiped out.

As an Australian male, it is absolutely horrifying that one of my male constituents who happens to be Aboriginal has, on average, a life expectancyâ€”I do not have the exact figure; I am sure it varies from place to placeâ€”of about 25 years less than mine. That should be a key indicator to every Australian; it is not acceptable.

While we acknowledge that the first lot of amendments introduced in May tightened up the administration of ATSIC, I am still getting the message from regional councils that the level of consultation is inadequate. We did not see the first lot of amendments until one day before their presentation to the House. Again, in my opinion, this is totally unacceptable. If we are going to introduce legislation into this place about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people there has to be consultation in advance. A draft bill should be sent out for consideration.

         People have also made the pointâ€”it is something that I agree withâ€”that they are told the minister has no power; that it has all gone to ATSIC. Quite frankly, one could perhaps be just a little suspicious about the way it has been set up, in that it enables the government minister to pass everything over to ATSIC. In fact, as one talks to Aboriginal and Islander communities right around Australia, one finds more and more often that people are describing instances where the ball is flicked away to ATSIC more often than a pass in a springbok test. That is probably wrong. I do not criticise the present minister for that, but I think it is inherent in the way ATSIC has been set up that it is now perceived by a great many as having been put there to take the pressure off the government; to take the heat off it. I do not think that is appropriate.

I concede that the job has to be done and that there are many people who are very active in ATSIC, both as commissioners and in the regional councils, who have a tremendous amount of ability. In the course of the last three weeks I have been incredibly impressed with the bearing and the conduct of most of the people who have come before us. They have been articulate, sensible and had commonsense as well. I do not pay tribute to them allâ€”there were some instances where one could have been a little critical of the performances, particularly the stage-managing of media events rather than getting down to the business of giving evidence to the committee. But forget that. By and large, I am totally impressed with the people we are meetingâ€”with their dignity and, as I said, with the way they are conducting the affairs of their organisations.

         But we still have the comment that nobody is consulting with the regional councils as to what the communities want and how the programs are working. That is not coming from me as a member of this parliament; that is coming from Aboriginal people who are members of regional councils. I believe that endorses and reinforces the need to have some form of external review. Three years down the track it is time for another detailed look. After all, the regional councils meet only every four to six weeks and they do not have enough time, hence the need for advisory committees. When we are looking at regional councils, we need to go beyond the power to make recommendations; we need to give them some real power.

         The final point I want to make concerns the composition of the ATSIC commissioners. At the present time two are appointed by the minister and, quite frankly, I believe that is wrong. The organisation should be fully elected by the people it represents. It is an outmoded instance of colonialism for the minister to have the power to appoint two commissioners to ATSIC. It would be just as bad for the New South Wales government to say to the people of Coffs Harbour, `You can elect seven of your councillors, but we are going to appoint two more'. Why should Aboriginal people be treated differently? I appeal to the minister: next time he is looking at amendments, he might take this on board and give to the Aboriginal and Islander people of Australia the right to elect the people that they want to run their particular affairs. Let us give some more teeth and some more real power to regional councils.

The deep cry from the heart of Aboriginal Australians, the deep cry from the soul of the Aboriginal people, is for recognition of them as Aboriginal Australiansâ€”recognition of their culture and their relationship to the land and to have that land, in many areas, restored to them.

We are talking about an area of land that would not be a decent sized farm. But that was knocked over in the Legislative Council. We had to put that legislation through this parliament in its original form, and of course it was opposed by the coalition. When it was passed by this parliament, the now Premier of Victoria, who was then state Leader of the Opposition, set off on a holy crusade through the western districts of Victoria talking about the enormity of this act. The grazing community, which is fairly conservative in that part of Victoria, told him to go away and not talk nonsense because it knew about the relationship Aboriginal people had with their land.

         At the end of the day, this coalition has to make up its mind as to how it will address the very important and fundamental cultural and physical needs of Aboriginal people. There is no argument about the inadequacy of health care. In many areas, the breakdown in health is often related to the fact that we are dealing with a dispossessed people whose culture has been broken. We are looking at people who, in many instances, in inner urban areas have been living as third and fourth generation slum families. In the regional centres of Australia, they have been regarded as second-class citizens for much of their lives.

         The first point I should put on the record is that the coalition has come an extraordinary distance in its understanding of Aboriginal aspirations and particularly Aboriginal aspirations for self-determination. Those of us who have been in the parliament for a while will remember that, when the government moved to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the government and indeed the then minister, Gerry Hand, were subjected to the most extraordinary vilification. There was a most extraordinary campaign against the then minister and the ideas that he was trying to advance.

         Indeed, it is to the credit of the opposition and to the shift in Australian public opinion that ATSIC now enjoys a very large degree of cross-party support in the parliament. In fact, the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), said in this chamber on 13 May that he agreed with meâ€”that is, the ministerâ€”that `support for ATSIC by both sides of the House is largely attributable to the quality, commitment, expertise and performance of ATSIC commissioners and their staff'. He went on to say that the opposition was particularly keen to see the continuation of the present high commitment to accountability by ATSIC. He is right.

         ATSIC is one of if not the most accountable public sector organisations at Commonwealth, state, territory or, for that matter, local level of government in Australia. It is not only subject to the normal constraints and constrictions relating to accountability involving the Auditor-General, the parliament and the attendant committees of the parliament but also subject to a great deal of scrutiny by the Office of Evaluation and Audit, whose powers are to be further enhanced in the legislation that is coming before the parliament later this year.

         It is also the case that because of the particular nature of Aboriginal affairs, because there are sections, regrettably, of the Australian community that are hostile to Aboriginal aspirations, there is no doubt that the media scrutiny of Aboriginal performance and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander accountability issues is dramatically higher than that given to non-indigenous organisations. Additionally, initiatives have been taken by government to subject ATSIC to further levels of public scrutiny and to further levels of accountability. They include the state of the nation report of the social justice commissioner, which I will refer to later in my remarks.

         But there are some very important things that should be put on the record about the achievements of ATSIC. First I emphasise the tremendous pride that we in the government have about the establishment of ATSIC and its performance because ATSIC is unique in the world. There is no other body in comparable countries or anywhere else that has been established and is responsible for a radical shift towards indigenous self-determination in the management, expenditure and control of government programs that impact on indigenous people.

         While it is true that countries such as New Zealand, Canada and, to an extent, the United States of America have shown the way to recognise indigenous rights by treaty making arrangements, there is no organisation like ATSIC anywhere else in the world. It is a great credit to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all those who participated in its establishment.

         The establishment of ATSIC has resulted in the shift of power from well intentioned ministers in Canberra, whether they be Fred Chaney, Peter Baume or people on the Labor side of politicsâ€”a radical shift in decision makingâ€”to the elected representatives of indigenous people in regional councils and a national board of commissioners. That shift in decision making is absolute. It is a credit to the parliament that there is an emerging understanding of the extent to which that shift has occurred.

         Some comparison should be made between the role of the minister responsible to the parliament for the ABC and my role in ATSIC because a very healthy ethos is developing and, provided ATSIC maintains its commitment to public accountability to the parliament, the maximum degree of self-determination ought to be manifested in ATSIC's policies. There ought not to be ministerial directions, however well intentioned, issued on a regular basis to constrain and restrict how ATSIC conducts its affairs.

         One of the best kept secrets of ATSIC is that it is a very lean and mean public administration machine. Only 14 per cent of its expenditure of $867 million in the current year will go on administration. That includes the entire cost of the ATSIC democratic processes. That figure is a great testimony to the extent to which dollars in the ATSIC program expenditure are not wasted on administration but are targeted towards programs on the ground to address issues of disadvantage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

         I understand that the opposition will not be calling for a division on its amendment.

The bill does not seek to challenge the administration of ATSIC but rather to focus on the continuing disadvantages in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and to pose the question why change has not happened at the rate and to the extent that all of us in this parliament would want.

         The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was right in saying that the last thing we need in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs at the moment is another inquiry. This country has had a landmark inquiryâ€”namely, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custodyâ€”which has charted the course for action by governments in indigenous affairs to address those very issues of disadvantage alluded to in the coalition amendment.

         The royal commission found that the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal imprisonmentâ€”resulting in the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody when compared with the wider communityâ€”was due to the underlying issues of health, housing, employment, education, lingering prejudice in the non-indigenous community and the lack of commitment by governments to principles of self-determination. We should be self-critical as a parliamentâ€”especially those of us on the government sideâ€”and leave ourselves open to public scrutiny to the maximum possible extent in determining whether or not we have given effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.

         Within the next month, an interim report on the Commonwealth government's action in giving effect to the royal commission's recommendations will be made public. Without pre-empting what will be in that document, I can say that it is a document of which the government can be very proud, because not only will it minutely detail each and every program that is funded as a result of the royal commission and talk about the impact of those programs but also it will record the names of the public servants who are responsible for the programs, together with their phone numbers. Not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also others in the community will have immediate access to further information about the progress of those programs.

The Department of Employment, Education and Training has programs that boost efforts by state and territory governments, but it is government that has the clear responsibility for delivering educational services to Aboriginal people. The pressure, the spotlight and the scrutiny cannot be on ATSIC alone; it must be on the whole Commonwealth government together with the state and territory governments whose combined resources are vastâ€”significantly greater than ATSICâ€”and who have a crucial role to play in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.

The history of this matter is that that is exactly the proposition that the government advocated in the last amendments to come before the parliament concerning ATSIC. To the credit of the opposition, it did not divide on that matter in the House of Representatives, although opposition to it was expressed. Regrettably, however, when the matter went to the Senate not only was there a division but there was a division that saw a very disappointing alliance of the Australian Democrats and the coalition to defeat the government's proposals to make ATSIC a totally elected body.

Why not have the confidence in Aboriginal people that we profess to have as members of parliament? If self-determination is to mean more than rhetoric and a comfortable turn of phrase in a parliamentary debate, we should give effect to our convictions. I would be the first to praise the opposition and the Australian Democrats if they were to embrace the opportunity presented by the Senate amendments to include an additional amendment to make ATSIC a totally elected body.

         I would like to conclude with a reference to the place of the process of reconciliation in this debate, particularly in the context of the opposition amendment. There are some essential elements of the process of reconciliation which have enjoyed the unanimous support of this parliament. One of those elements is a commitment, I believe, by all political parties and independents represented in the Australian parliament, to put social justice issues and the reconciliation process on the national agenda as one of the central elements to be addressed by our nation as we head towards the centenary of the Australian Federation.

         That deliberate strategy of putting the reconciliation process in place was to give us, as a nation, time to work through these issues. We do have some time, but the need is critical. No-one should underestimate the extent of the suffering still occurring in Aboriginal communities, but if we are going to address that suffering and disadvantage, it can only happen by sufficiently resourcing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs, by supporting self-determination by Aboriginal people and their control of those programs as the key to addressing those social justice objectives of the reconciliation process.

I urge them to play the greatest constructive role possible on their side of politics to make the coming time of public and parliamentary debate about the Mabo issue as constructive as possible. It is going to be extremely difficult in the coming debate to achieve continuing cross-party cooperation in other areas of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, but I hope there are enough of us in this place who realise the tremendous damage done to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when Aboriginal affairs becomes an embittered party political football and who can at least strive for common ground, based on a firm foundation of commitment to the principles that I have spoken of in the course of my remarks.

         â€”My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does the Treasury analysis of the budget that the Treasurer released yesterday allow for the fact that the pick-up in wage inflation generated by this budget will, through bracket creep, increase the tax burden on Australians by around $4 billion over the four-year budget period? If the Treasury analysis does not allow for that, is it not true that the Treasurer has tried to hide the fact that budget mark 2 makes most Australians worse off and hits the poor the hardest?

        The disappointment for the opposition lies in the fact that the analysis which was done does not reveal what the opposition hoped it would reveal. I will not try to imbue the Prismod model with any spurious precision because anyone should know that all of these analyses have their flaws. Those flaws have been pointed out in the explanatory documentation which the Treasury has provided on every occasion that the Prismod analysis has been used, either for the earlier analysis of the opposition's plans or in relation to this particular set of proposals.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is a total furphy to introduce the idea of bracket creep into this particular analysis. This analysis has been conducted on the basis that the price, cost, and distributional estimates may be interpreted as the change from the status quo if all the scheduled tax changes, out to the last tobacco increase in August 1995 but deflated to present values, took place in July 1993 with all the long run price effects occurring immediately. In other words, the analysis has been done on the basis of what the situation was on the day before the budget and what the situation was just after the budget if all of the changes had taken their effect overnight, which of course they do not. They take their effect over the course of the next few years. Therefore, there are no assumptions about additional wages growth, because this is a point changeâ€”a point change from one day to another, effectively, on the basis of these changes. That is the only credible way in which to undertake these changes.

         I also make the point, if the opposition wants to get into some of the particular details, that it should be pointed out that a number of the measures taken in this budget on the outlay side, particularly those which advantage lower income groups, have not been included in the model. For example, waiving the waiting period for jobsearch allowance, increasing the earned income allowance for JSA and NSA recipients, easing the assets test withdrawal for pensioners, introducing the seniors health card, introducing the initiatives to boost the provisions of affordable child care, and a number of other matters, have not been included. If they were, they would all be advantageous to lower income groups.

         Similarly, there are a number of other measures on the revenue side which have also not been modelled; for instance, the changes to FBT and non-deductible expenditures, which overwhelmingly would not impact on lower income groups. In the event, what this analysis has done is underestimate the benefits going to lower income groups and exaggerate the benefits going to higher income groups. I leave it to those people who have a fascination with economic models to have out this debate. I do not intend to get involved in a dispute between economic models. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition has a fascination for these mattersâ€”a fascination I do not share.

         â€”For a long timeâ€”indeed, until 1984â€”wine drinkers in Australia did enjoy a very privileged position. They drank wine which was not subject to excise and was not subject to sales tax, whereas other alcoholic drinks such as beer and spirits were subject to a taxation regimeâ€”primarily excise. This, the government concluded at the time, was clearly inequitable. Over the years we have moved to remove this inequity. In doing so, this is a demonstration of the kinds of decisions which we were prepared to take, and which the coalition squibbed for many years. If we are now to make a comparison on the basis of the changes which were announced in the budget to increase sales tax for wine, we find that somebody who is buying a four-litre cask of wine will be paying 17 1/2 per cent of the post-budget purchase price in the form of Commonwealth taxation. If we take another comparison of five 750-millilitre bottles of beer, we find that about 32 per cent of the purchase price would be taken in the form of Commonwealth taxation.

         This comparison is even more stark if we look at the dollars per litre of alcohol taken in Commonwealth taxation. On cask wine, it would be just over $3 per litre of alcohol compared with $18.50 per litre of alcohol in beer. We believe that this is an equity and fairness measure to remove some of the disparity.

         â€”The honourable member probably belongs to the chardonnay set and does not like beer much. But a lot of ordinary Australians have been taxed more heavily through drinking beer rather than wine. There is another point about consumption patterns of wine since the introduction of the 1986 increase in the sales tax on wine. People talking about reductions in wine sales forget to mention that the consumption of alcoholic drinks by the population as a whole has gone down since 1985-86 by 14 1/2 per cent in response to such things as random breath testing, more healthy lifestyles and so on.

         During that period, consumption of wine per capita has decreased by 14 per centâ€”that is about averageâ€”whereas the reduction in beer has been much greater. For normal strength beer it has been 22.5 per cent. So it cannot be claimed, as some in the wine industry would have us believe, that these changes have resulted in a massive reduction in consumption. Reduced consumption has occurred across all alcoholic drinks.

A single income family with two children, earning three-quarters of average weekly earnings, will have experienced an increase in real disposable income of 18.7 per cent.

         Importantly, and by contrast, a family with two children and a single income earner on average weekly earnings received very little increase in real income at all over the period. So for the people on three-quarters of average weekly earnings there has been an increase of 18.7 per cent. For a sole parent with two children the increase has been 32 per cent. For a process worker, married with two children, the increase has been just on 15 per cent. But someone on average weekly earnings has received next to nothing.

         That is why this time the government wanted the tax cuts designed to help those people on incomes between $20,700 and $50,000 so that somebody on average weekly earnings would get an increase of about $8 a week. People on average weekly earnings have not had a wage increase for two years, yet the opposition wants to deny an $8 a week increase to this group. In the Senate the opposition will vote against the measure to extend the tax cuts to the second week of November this year and provide an increase of around $8 to $10 for people on average weekly earnings and just above.

What a shocking front I have to actually go and say that the opposition is opposing the government's revenue measures in the Senate, and that they will vote against tax cuts for middle income earners. And what a dreadful thing it is to make it clear to the nation that the revenue measures which are there for the government's budget and the nation's budget between this year and 1996-97 will also provide tax cuts for middle income earners.

Let us take the example of unemployed single adults. What happened to them between 1975 and 1983? Their income was down in real terms by 18.5 per centâ€”a cut of 18.5 per cent by the coalition during its period of office. Under us, their income went up by 23 per cent, or 53 per cent if they were renting privately.

As we have made very clear, the effects of these changes are designed to provide benefits to middle income Australians. I reiterate: whatever comfort the opposition might be able to derive from its various economic models, what these models do not prove is that lower income Australians are disadvantaged. They are not. That is the point which the opposition finds very hard to swallow. That is why opposition members have become increasingly querulous during this week.

         â€”The Treasurer has amply demonstrated the decline in real disposable income which occurred during the coalition's period of office. This government set about to remedy that when we came to office in 1983. We started with a program which gave affordable wage increases, which gave periodic large tax cuts and which introduced the family allowance supplement, which is now worth $43 a week per child. For a three-child family, it is about $130 a week. We also offered $42 a week rent assistance. That was $172 a week to somebody on $20,000 or $22,000. There was an enormous change to income support for low income families. There were supplementary payments for lower paid workers, mainly women, and there was occupational award superannuation.

Towards the end of the last parliament photographers were allowed access to question time under strict conditions which were set down after consultation with party whips. One of the conditions is that the cameras focus on the member with the call. Those arrangements involved allowing up to four photographers who are members of the federal parliamentary press gallery or the government photographic service to have access to question time each day. Photographers who wish to have access on any particular day advise the Serjeant-at-Arms's office.

        The Qantas Sale Act 1992 received royal assent on 21 December 1992. At that time, it was expected that the sale of the Commonwealth's entire equity interest in Qantas would be completed in October-November 1993. In line with this expectation, and the requirement that all legislation should be proclaimed within a reasonable period after its passage by parliament, the Qantas Sale Act contained provision for any of its unproclaimed sections to be automatically repealed if they had not been enacted by 31 December 1993.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government's recent announcement that the proposed initial public offering of shares in Qantas would be deferred until 1994-95 means therefore that, in the absence of any legislation to remedy this situation, the provisions intended to commence on the dates on which 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the airline are sold will, in fact, lapse on 31 December 1993. Of most concern to the government in this regard, naturally, are the employee related provisions of the Qantas Sale Actâ€”which are planned to come into effect on the day on which 50 per cent of the airline is sold.

         These provisions either `save', post-sale, certain existing employee entitlements and rights arising from presale service, or else they remove airline employees from the ambit of legislation applying only to employees of entities that are owned or controlled by the Commonwealth. The premature removal of airline employees from the ambit of such Commonwealth legislation while the Qantas group remains 75 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, and the failure to put amending legislation in place to retain those employees' already accrued benefits gained presale, would clearly be inequitable and could not be supported by the government. It is imperative that these provisions not be allowed to lapse.

         To prevent any such inadvertent removal of the rightful entitlements of the airline employees concerned, I propose that the date of automatic repeal in the Qantas Sale Act be altered to accord with the rescheduled timing for the sale of the remainder of the Commonwealth's shares in Qantas in 1994-95. Accordingly, the bill before the House amends the date of the automatic repeal of the unproclaimed sections of the Qantas Sale Act from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The opportunity is also being taken in this bill to make a minor amendment to the Qantas Sale Act to remove any doubt about the intended operation of section 37 of that act. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.

        The purpose of this bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the states, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in 1993-94, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on 5 July 1993. The bill will replace the State Grants (General Purposes) Act 1992 and its provisions closely follow those of that act.

         The current estimate of general purpose funding for the states and the Northern Territory under the bill amounts to $14.7 billion, or about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth budget outlays in 1993-94. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's budget. In combination with the Loan Council allocations agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector and in particular state governments.

         At the 1993 Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth, states and territories recognised that the economy is continuing to expand but the generally subdued growth of the international economy is hampering a more rapid domestic recovery. While recognising that 1993-94 is not the year to cut dramatically into budget deficits, the

         report identified that significant structural repair of both Commonwealth and state budgets is needed in order to lift national savings over the medium-term. Indeed, the government's medium-term budgetary objective is to reduce the Commonwealth's deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, and the states will need to adopt a medium-term strategy of deficit restraint if the public sector is to make a significant contribution to savings.

         Most of the assistance to be provided under this bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $14.4 billion in 1993-94. The level of financial assistance grants in 1993-94 has been set so as to fulfil the Commonwealth's three-year real terms guarantee that was agreed at the 1990 Premiers Conference.

         The distribution of these grants is essentially determined by the Medicare adjusted relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its 1993 report, including a further adjustment for the alternative treatment of stamp duty revenues from corporate reconstructions. The Northern Territory and the ACT will receive special revenue assistance funded from the pool of financial assistance grants of $30 million and $20 million respectively in recognition of the adjustments they face in moving to state-like funding levels.

         The use of the commission's Medicare adjusted relativities reflects understanding reached with the states as part of the new Medicare agreements. The health funding arrangements under the new Medicare agreement took account of a number of health factors which were also addressed by the commission's methodology. Therefore, to implement the new agreement without also amending the commission methodology to exclude these factors would have involved a significant element of double counting.

         The impact of the new arrangements on the interstate distribution of Medicare funding was to increase significantly funding to the smaller states at the expense of New South Wales and Victoria. The adjustments to the commission's methodology were expected to have the opposite effect; that is, to redistribute financial assistance grants from the smaller states to New South Wales and Victoria.

         New South Wales and Victoria were given guarantees that this redistribution of financial assistance grants would benefit them by $131 million and $112 million respectively. In the event, New South Wales benefited from the new relativities, but by significantly less than expected, while Victoria actually lost. At the same time, the smaller states and Northern Territory lost significantly less from the Medicare adjustment to the financial assistance grants distribution than was expected. Against this background, it was decided at the Premiers Conference that the cost of the Medicare guarantee payments to New South Wales and Victoria would be shared between the Commonwealth and the states.

         The contribution from the smaller states is achieved by funding payments totalling $216.6 millionâ€”to New South Wales  $72.5 million and Victoria $144.1 millionâ€”out of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants pool. These payments are funded by each state according to its share of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants pool. Consequently, funding the payments out of the pool costs New South Wales $62.8 million, 29 per cent of $216.6 million, and Victoria $45.5 million, 21 per cent of $216.6 million. The Commonwealth will make payments of these amounts to New South Wales and Victoria totalling $108.3 million, thus ensuring that the net benefit to New South Wales and Victoria will be $72.5 million and $144.1 million respectively. The gross payments to New South Wales and Victoria are therefore $135 million and $190 million respectively.

         For the first time, state-like funding for the ACT will be incorporated into this bill. In previous years the general revenue grants to the ACT have been funded directly by the Commonwealth rather than through the financial assistance grants pool. State-like funding for the ACT will be incorporated into the financial assistance grants pool for 1993-94 and the size of the pool has been increased to reflect that change in funding. Special revenue assistance to the ACT of $20 million in 1993-94 will also be funded from the financial assistance grants pool and is included in this bill. Other payments to the ACT, including transitional allowances and special fiscal needs totalling $64 million as well as a further $20 million special revenue assistance, will be paid directly by the Commonwealth under the annual appropriation bills.

         As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1993-94 of $30 million. In general, the relativities recommended by the commission take account of the particular circumstances facing individual states and territories. The high per capita relativity recommended for the Northern Territory recognises the higher costs it faces in providing government services to its population. In the medium term this level of funding should be sufficient to enable the Northern Territory to provide the same level of services to its population as are enjoyed by people in other states. The purpose of the special revenue assistance is to allow the Northern Territory to adjust to this level of funding from the more generous levels provided in earlier years. It compares with special revenue assistance of around $40 million provided for this purpose in 1992-93 and similar assistance having been provided each year to the Northern Territory since its inclusion in the pool of general revenue assistance for the states.

        The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill makes various amendments to a number of provisions: firstly, modify a provision which has been used to cover productivity superannuation determinations, to reflect the fact that they are no longer `interim'; secondly, modify the right of appeal from conscientious objection tribunals to reflect more accurately the role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; thirdly, streamline procedures covering command and discipline where forces of Australia and other countries are serving together; fourthly, enable trustees of four welfare funds to be appointed by a minister rather than by the Governor-General; fifthly, remove an unintended double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme; and sixthly, provide a special home loans benefit for members of the Defence Force allotted to warlike service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Before dealing in more detail with the last two matters, which are of greater significance, I would like to make a few observations on the other amendments. The superannuation determination amendments are simply to ensure that there is proper authority for determinations dealing with ongoing superannuation benefits for members of the Defence Force.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The conscientious objection amendments would modify a right of appeal. Where a conscientious objection tribunal has determined an application, there is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT, then to the Federal Court. At present, the Federal Court could hear a conscientious objection appeal from the AAT on a question of law and, with the leave of the court, on any other ground. The amendments would eliminate the right of appeal on grounds other than questions of law, to accord with current administrative law policy whereby the AAT provides final merits review.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I should add that, although these amendments are necessary to reflect administrative law policy, they are not expected to have any practical effect. This is because questions of conscientious objection arise only in the context of conscription, and there could be no conscription unless Australia was under direct threat of attack.

         The amendments to streamline command and discipline procedures where forces of Australia and other countries serve together will avoid the requirement for a series of formal declarations where ongoing cooperation could be anticipated. A standing declaration, to cover a particular country, would invoke mutual powers of command and discipline whenever the forces of that country were serving together with ours. Of course, this facility would be used only for close allies where we could anticipate ongoing international cooperation, for example, in peacekeeping activities.

         I now turn to the two more significant matters in the bill. The amendments to remove a double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme will correct a drafting omission. The error would allow some members who elected to transfer from the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme to the military superannuation and benefits scheme to receive a double benefit. The amendments have retrospective effect to the commencement of the new scheme on 1 October 1991 to remove the liability for the double benefit for members who have retired since then. Recent changes to the military superannuation and benefits rules have removed the problem for affected members who retire after 21 April 1993.

         There are two groups of members eligible to receive double benefits: Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme members who had retired with a pension; and members who had separated from the Defence Force and transferred their benefits to another superannuation scheme. Where a member of either group re-entered the Defence Force and then transferred to the military superannuation and benefits scheme, the drafting error would allow the member to retain the benefit derived from contributions paid in the first period of service and also to be paid those contributions again with interest. The amendments would remove the entitlement to the unintended double benefit. Forty-three former members are affected. They have been advised in writing that any payment of the double benefit would be recoverable but, as no additional monies have been paid to date, it is hoped to avoid the need for recovery action.

       <para first-indent="16">

         On a more positive note, I come to the amendments to provide a special home loans benefit for members of the Defence Force who have been allotted to warlike service. In May of this year the government agreed to a framework for conditions of service where members of the Defence Force are deployed overseas. The government's aim is to ensure that members who are deployed overseas will be assured of consistent and timely benefits. An important element of the agreed conditions is an enhanced home loans benefit for personnel allotted to service declared as `warlike'. This benefit will apply to members involved in the recent operational service in Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. The same benefit will be available for members allotted for service in any future overseas operation of a comparable nature.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The additional benefit comprises waiver of the requirement for a qualifying period of six years service together with an additional subsidy period ranging from two to five years, depending on the length of warlike service. For example, members who have completed operational service in Somalia will now qualify for waiver of the six-year qualifying period and an additional subsidy period of three years. The maximum subsidy period is also increased from 20 to 25 years.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          As I have indicated, these benefits will be available also to all personnel allotted for future service declared as warlike and represent an ongoing commitment by the government to see overseas service by Defence Force personnel appropriately recognised.

         The kinds of operation in question are an essential element of Australia's determination to play a fitting role as a good international citizen. As the burden of that role often falls on members of the Defence Force who are deployed in extremely difficult circumstances, I am sure the House will support the government's measures to establish a suitable framework for the associated conditions of service. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

         â€”The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, which we are debating, deals with five separate matters: first, to take into account certain employer fringe benefits in the income test for family payment and the parental income test for jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance recipients of claimants under 18 years of age; second, to take foreign income into account in the income test for the family payment; third, to introduce the government's election promise in relation to establishing a seniors health card; fourth, to make the foreign currency provisions in the Social Security Act more responsive to market exchange rates; and, finally, to extend the period for payment of the advance pharmaceutical allowance. The seniors card was an election commitment. The matters relating to employer provided fringe benefits were the subject of comment in the 1992-93 budget. The other three items are new initiatives.

         At this point, let me make it clear that, while I will be moving a second reading amendment, these are measures that we do not intend at this stageâ€”I underline at this stageâ€”to oppose. I make that point because certain matters will be referred to a Senate committee for further examination and inquiry, and that may give rise to possible amendments at a later stage on the issue of the employer provided fringe benefits. I will come to that in a moment.

         I make it very clear in the first instance that this is important legislation. It obviously has certain financial implications for the government. As far as the opposition is concerned, the family allowance, as it is known, and the supplementary benefits are important programs. In fact, it was the Menzies government which in 1941 introduced the initiative known as child endowment. Members of parliament from this side of the chamber take a great deal of pride in the initiatives that enabled those who had families to be advanced in the costs that they have to meet and to assist in family formation through the assistance originally of the child endowment.

         â€”Forty years. It is an outstanding initiative by our predecessor Liberal governments. It is not an important welfare initiative by Labor, but an initiative of non-Labor parties. I take great pride in that. In 1976 the Fraser government brought in the family allowance arrangements to replace the child endowment and ensured that that payment could be made to all families. It was not subject to any income or assets test and it was to assist with family formation.

         Members of the Labor Party may say with great pride, `We were the people who then started to limit it so that some families would not be able to be eligible for that support for family formation'. If they want to remind us that they were the first people to introduce assets tests in relation to the benefits that limit family support, let them do it. But I was not proposing to remind people that they were the niggardly folk who introduced those sorts of limitations on the access to those important benefits.

         â€”Do not let me bait you? I can never be baited in relation to these matters. It is important to look at the steps that the government took to introduce a form of income and assets testing of eligibility for family assistance. If we are to have a schema which is designed to limit payments in that wayâ€”it has been part of the government's philosophy to pursue that approachâ€”then it needs to be effective. It is one of the matters that we noted in Fightback. This government had allowed a situation to arise where family payments could be limited to those who had a family income of up to about $65,000 and those beyond it would be excluded. But it allowed situations to persist where people might have had notional incomes of many hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some people were known to be taking their benefits in forms other than salary.

         We made it very clear in Fightback that, if one was pledged to this sort of targeted approach, it needed to be effective. We believe the system in that senseâ€”as the government allowed it to developâ€”had become inequitable and badly targeted. People with very substantial additional fringe benefits were obtaining access to family allowance. When others with smaller incomesâ€”and only one source of incomeâ€”were excluded it created serious problems of inequity.

         We highlighted that and the government, very properly, after giving it a good deal of thought, has come forward with a package that, in the end result, seems to us to be severely flawed. That is the result of the government's period of deliberation. I draw to the attention of the House the manner in which these provisions are flawed. The package was designed to take into account a family's total income rather than just its taxable income. It was designed to include very specific benefits for health insurance payments by an employer; the provision of a car by an employer; school fees, if they might have been paid by an employer; certain subsidised loans; and housing fringe benefits. Housing fringe benefits were intended to garner up those situations in which people might be established in a fairly substantial residence, where they either paid nothing for it or paid a rental that was considerably below market value.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In endeavouring to put provisions of that sort in place, the government's proposals run very much further than one might have thought. The government tries to exclude relatively minor additional and supplementary payments. It excludes union fees where they might be paid by an employer. They might run to cover a whole lot of other things. It has been suggested to me that some unions even include payments of health benefits as part of their fee to enable people to escape the provisions of the fringe benefits tax. They are able to run it through union fees. If there are such rorts in place, it is obviously of concern to me that this legislation is deficient in not running to cover those matters.

         The government drew the rental subsidy in such a way as to cover its own employees and also the defence forces. It drew it in such a way as to cover those people who may be living in rental accommodation in more remote parts of Australia, sometimes in situations where the provision of housing might be a very important condition of the very service that people have to give.

         The way in which the provisions are to operate provides some flexibility in terms of what will actually be deemed to be a market rent, so the subsidies may not necessarily be a real test in that sense. Nevertheless, it is clear that people who have very small incomesâ€”and where there are fairly marginal benefits in the form of rental subsidiesâ€”could be affected by these proposals in relation to their supplementary benefits. Or, in the case of the defence forces, those people at officer level might perhaps be excluded from eligibility for family allowances in circumstances where they suffer a very considerable disadvantage in other senses.

         These are some of the matters that we believe ought to be looked at by a parliamentary committee. We think it is important to establish whether the concerns that have been raised with usâ€”by the RSL, some defence families in particular, and also by other people who are required to serve in remote places, such as police, teachers, and fairly low-paid public servantsâ€”about these provisions to assess rental subsidies may in fact be so unconscionable as to warrant reconsideration of the proposals.

         I want to take up the issue of the rental subsidy. It was drawn to my attention in a letter from a member of the defence forces that there have been certain policy statements by the government which might have some implications in this area. This lady wrote in her letter:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I believe that the inclusion of ADF rental subsidy as income is wrong. It is not part of the ADF salary package. That is shown by the fact that the subsidy ceases when a member has his own home in the posting locality.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it was not part of the salary package; it was not paid to everybody who was living in that particular situation. When people own their own homes in that locality the subsidy is not paid. That would suggest that it is not a fringe benefit in the sense that we normally regard these matters as fringe benefits. She went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The rental subsidy is compensation for the housing disadvantages suffered by ADF members through being moved frequently. You may recall a Task Force looked at ADF housing in 1984-85 and out of its study some Government policy goals for employee housing were adopted.
       </para>
       <para>
        She attached a copy of those goals. I had not seen them before, but I think it would be worth while for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) to look at them. It does suggest that other factors were taken into account in establishing this form of benefit. In other words, it was not seen as a salary substitute or as supplementing people's income; it was seen as a compensation for the particular service that they are rendering to the nation.

         I welcome the fact that in relation to the testing for family payments the government now intends to take into account foreign income. My colleague Senator Calvert was one of the first to draw attention to the fact that people who had been resident in Australia were able to move overseas and draw very considerable incomes overseas, leaving their wives and children at home and continuing to receive benefits. These people were in a position to remit to their families very substantial income that was not taken into account for assessment under the income test. Having drawn attention to that, we believe that this is an appropriate response.

         I raise also the issue of making foreign currency provisions more responsive to market exchange fluctuations. I recently had the opportunity to visit Western Australia. I know the Department of Social Security is familiar with the case. A lady there had had what is often referred to as a `complex assessment' of the pension benefits that she was eligible to receive. This lady was subjected to review because she had a small amount of overseas income, some shares and some annuities, but not so large as to exclude her from eligibility for a pension.

         What the department did in her circumstances was remarkable. The first advice date was 19 November 1991, effective from 29 August, and there was a change in the payment of pension. There was a further advice date effective at 5 December 1991, one at 9 December 1991, one at 22 January 1992, one at 7 February 1992, one at 27 February 1992, one at 12 March 1992, one at 26 March 1992, one at 7 May 1992, one at 18 June, one at 2 July, one at 13 August, one at 29 September one at 8 October, one at 19 November, one at 3 December, one at 28 January, one at 11 March, two at 25 March, two at 8 April, one at 6 May, one at 20 May and one at 3 June. What will the government do when it starts adjusting pension eligibility more frequently for currency fluctuations? And the government expects its departmental officials to be able to manage those sorts of cases!

It also pointed out the large number of errors that were occurring. It did not quantify the extent of those errorsâ€”a matter that I would like to see clarified by the estimates committeeâ€”but it is obviously a matter of concern when there are such frequent variations that adjustments are required as often as I have indicated.

         The other matter to which I wish to draw attention, and the reason I have proposed this amendment, is the impact that the government's budget is having on the most vulnerable people in Australia, the people generally reliant upon welfare for their support. While there has been a lot of discussion to date about the government's budget and its regressive nature, yesterday the Treasury tabled a model which illustrated the number of people affected by the government's budget measures, particularly with relation to taxation changes. It is a very interesting table and it clearly establishes that pensioners are the most vulnerable of all those affected.

         Dr Neil Warren, an economist at the University of New South Wales, substantially criticised the model because of the extent to which the data was flawed and because matters affecting the most vulnerable were ignored. Even if one accepts those criticisms, as I do, the model discloses that the lowest income quintileâ€”pensionersâ€”are the third most disadvantaged group. The second quintile, married pensioners, are the second most disadvantaged group. The income effect upon them is negative, as it is for those in the fourth quintile, who, as the government's own analysis establishes, are the most disadvantaged of any group.

         We all know about taxation and pensioners receiving supplementary income. It had been government policy to exclude pensioners from the taxation system, but, as a result of the Treasurer's announcement, they still have to pay tax even though they are in receipt of pensions. They are also affected by bracket creep, which is another matter not taken into account.

         The budget changes are regressive because those on higher incomes are the real net beneficiaries of the government's budget. In other words, the government gave tax cuts to those who are well off but not to those who are most in need. One of the points that need to be made is that the government has introduced very significant increases in indirect taxation which will impact very significantly on the most disadvantaged people in the community, particularly those with little or no supplementary income and who are reliant on welfare.

         On the other hand, the opposition proposed a broadly based consumption tax which would have provided an eight per cent increase in the pension level and a six per cent increase for all other beneficiaries against a gross impact on their cost of living of around two per cent. In the main, they would have been between four and six per cent better off. That was the compensation package that the opposition proposed. This government proposes no compensation package at all to those people reliant on welfare.

         I want to make some very simple points particularly in relation to the sales tax issue. The way in which the government's sales tax changes have been structured affect the most vulnerable. How does that occur? It occurs in this way: the government increases all rates of sales tax by one per cent. If a person is paying 10 per cent wholesales sales tax on products he might be consuming, then a 10 per cent tax increase has occurred. If it is a 20 per cent wholesale sales taxed item, a one per cent increase in fact is a five per cent increase in the tax payable on those products. If it is at the 30 per cent rate, the one per cent rise is only a 3.3 per cent increase. It is very important that we understand those differences. If we then go and look at what items are taxed at 10 per cent, what do we find they are? They include biscuits, snack foods, ice-cream, iceblocks, confectionery, fruit juice, non-alcoholic wines and beverages, cordial, flavoured milk; a number of homeware items such as garbage cans and bags, compost bins, incinerators, broomsâ€”very basic itemsâ€”buckets, doormatsâ€”

But the fact is that in Blacktown, we find vehicles using unleaded fuel are 31 per cent of those registered while those using leaded fuel are 59 per cent. In Liverpool the vehicles using leaded petrol are 58 per cent and 32 per cent use unleaded; in Campbelltown it is 61 per cent leaded and 32 per cent unleaded; in Canterbury it is 62 per cent leaded and 31 per cent unleaded; and in Bankstown, the electorate of the Prime Minister, it is 50 per cent leaded as against 37 per cent unleaded.

But in terms of the government's constituency, the people who vote for it, the people who are described as true believers, they are the ones who have been hit to leg, and that is the reason we propose this amendment.

         â€”The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) brings about one election promise of 1993â€”in particular, the seniors health card. I am interested to note that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) is not the slightest bit interested in health cards. The opposition is much more involved in the whole issue of private health care. What does the health care card mean? It means that 200,000 Australians will have a health care card which will enable them to have access to doctors, to pharmaceutical benefits, to hearing benefits, and later to the dentistry benefits.

        What is important in this is the range of benefits. It is particularly important for us, as Australians, to look at that whole issue of hearing benefits. No other country has the kind of hearing testing facilities that we have in Australia at the National Acoustics Laboratory. Australians are very well served by that particular agency. It is important as people age that they have access to those services without having problems in relation to money. The extension of the seniors health card is a delivery of an election promise. It also means that people now have access to a whole range of services for which previously they had to pay.

         The 200,000 people include a whole range of people who because of assets or their residency requirements have traditionally been precluded from receiving benefits. The government is delivering on this election promise for these people. When we hear honourable members opposite talking about the poor, talking about people on low incomes, we should remember that they somehow forget the range of services that are available and the kinds of factors which make up the social wage. They have very little understanding of what a social wage is. We understand that that is important.

         The same can also be said about the family payments and the whole issue of wages verses income. As a government, we believe in prior right. It is a prior right of people who are most in need and who are most deserving. How do you say to someone who earns wages and who is on pay as you earn, `I am terribly sorry you can't have the family income supplement, but the person next door who is living in subsidised housing, who is driving a subsidised car, who is having subsidised holidays, and a whole range of other subsidised services is entitled because technically that is not wages'. It is a nonsense, and it cannot be allowed to continue.

         I am very interested to hear the concerns of the honourable members opposite on a range of factors when they look at the issue of wholesales sales tax. I remind honourable members opposite that Australians own more colour televisions per person and more video recorders than any other country yet they are most found in lower socioeconomic groupings within Australia. One may ask: why is this so? Why? Because the area where they live, as the honourable member for Berowra has so clearly designated, has very few services. The whole issue and question of access to those services are at the very heart of disadvantageâ€”disadvantages certainly on a level of income but also on a level of accessibility. When we look at a whole range of products which are available, the people in our community who find those things very useful and, in particular, a very important part of their life, think that those products are much more important than, perhaps, biscuits or ice-cream, which the honourable member for Berowra seems to find necessary.

         When we look at the whole issue of unleaded and leaded petrol, it is certainly true that many of our people do have cars that use leaded petrol. But why? I can cite an example from my very own electorate of Fordeâ€”a city of 160,000 people with the worst public transport in Australia which is recognised and acknowledged in a national report. That is why people have to have carsâ€”cars that they find difficult to own. The local council there has failed to take up the challenge, and it has failed to address the needs of the people. I say to honourable members opposite that it is not a Labor council. Why should our children be subjected to a lead content in the air which is worse than parts of Sydney where we have heard that lead emissions are less? Why should children who come from poorer socioeconomic areas live in an environment where the lead content is heavier and, therefore, the damage to their health is stronger? We have to ask the honourable member for Berowra: is this what he wants? Does he want all those people who live in lower socioeconomic areas to have their children subjected to higher lead levels?

         I am reminded of when I was a very young child and a child down the road was dying from eating paint off the railings of a house because leaded paint was used. The same kinds of arguments were used then against a change from leaded to unleaded paint in that the poor were unable to afford to repaint their houses so their children could die because they had leaded paint. The same is true now. Are we saying now that the children of those people who are poor can continue to live in an atmosphere where lead content is unacceptably high and where their children are in danger? The target for this matter must be the delivery of public transport to those areas to ensure that people, who often do not want to own cars but who find through necessity that they own cars, are at a total disadvantage. That is one of the areas which we must address and look at. We must also look at ways in which people's lives can be made more meaningful.

        There has over the years been a very strong movement towards the remuneration of employees especially higher income earnersâ€”by fringe benefits packages which allowed income tax to be avoided on substantial parts of the overall remuneration. So-called tax-free perks came to dominate salary package negotiations and packages were openly advertised in the market place.

        In his usual, even-handed and objective way he finished by saying that fringe benefits are `the most rutted-in tax shelter and the most untouchable income of all'. We have to look at this legislation in light of what the present Prime Minister had to say about seven years ago at one end of the spectrum and relate that to the impact of this legislation, if we accept it as it has been drafted, in certain areasâ€”particularly the Australian Defence Force, the police forces and, in some circumstances, certain public servants and so on. I remind the House of subparagraph (2) of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra. In part it says:

       <para>
        It is very important to draw the line between fringe benefits and conditions of service and to highlight that differential.

        Many of those fundamental conditions of service are under threat if the legislation unamended is approved in this parliament. Conditions of service within the Defence Force are compensation for those unique demands. Whilst the sharpness of that sort of comment might lose some of its thrust in a time of peace, it is very important that we not lose sight of the fact that those conditions are there to attract and retain uniformed people in the Defence Force. That same report went on to talk about the unique nature of the military and, in part, it said:

         A lot of people do not seem to want to understand that the Defence Force environment is unique. People who receive those payments do not seek to have them paid. They receive them as recompense for their regular movements and the way they are moved around this country and overseas. They are a couple of points in the context of this legislation that I think need to be made very strongly to the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, and I hope to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and, indeed, to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner).

        Having extracted some of those comments from a number of people and organisations, I make three points. Firstly, conditions of service as I have just defined them in relation to this legislation were never given by a government of whatever complexion as any sort of tax shelter; they are a form of compensation. Secondly, a great majority of people who will be affected by the inclusion of these conditions of service as fringe benefits for the purpose of this legislation are not higher income earners. Thirdly, Defence Force personnel clearly do not negotiate their salary packages; they are somewhat hostages to fortune.

         I fully support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra. There is, however, another dimension to the problem that concerns me which I place on the public record. I was informed yesterday that certain directions within the defence hierarchy have told people to use the phrase `clam up on these issues within the Department of Defence'. In fact, I am also told that a particular article in a service newspaper was directed to be withdrawn. So, surely, those relatively small occurrences in themselves are an indictment of what this government is trying to do.

         The honourable member for Forde talked about the increase in the fuel tax and criticised the opposition. I mentioned betrayal and deceit. I will give another example of that. Twelve months ago in Toowoomba I addressed about 1,000 people who were objecting very strongly to the possibility of old cars being put off the road as a result of some of the policies of this federal government. That was in August. It took me until December to get the minister for the environment and the then minister for land transport to make a joint statement. Categorically, they said that this was a beat-up, that people need not worry and, specifically, that there would not be a differential in terms of petrol pricing. What do we find? Of course there is a differential. Why? Because this government is strapped for money. This is nothing but a crass revenue raising exercise without any regard for the social conscience and social awareness which those on the other side of the House think they have the reserve on. That is not so. This government should stand condemned and stands condemned.

         â€”The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a further step along this government's road to greater social justice in Australia. It is a concrete example of the care and commitment that the Keating government has for those Australians who are in need. This bill is the second part of a two-pronged policy of the government. Legislation has already been passed which will improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions asset test. This benefit takes effect from 20 September 1993.

         The bill that we are considering today is the second prong in our policy of easing the lot of low income retirees. It is to introduce a seniors health card, effective from 1 April 1994. The principal help which this card will give is that it will provide for certain older, low income, non-pensioner retirees to have access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions. Even if they are entitled to only $1 of pension, they will be able to get this seniors card. The department estimates that this initiative will help approximately 200,000 people.

         Besides the seniors health card, this legislation seeks to remove an anomaly associated with a small number of families receiving income from overseas in foreign currency.

Social justice requires that the government be constantly looking to see that its resources, which help the needy, do reach the needy.

         It is very important at this point to be clear about a very necessary distinction. There are two vital social security groupings: income assistance payment and income support payment. Assistance payments are given to help parents and others meet the cost of raising children. The family payment is the principal example of an assistance payment. Support payment, on the other hand, is generally a person's sole source of income. The pension is the principal example of a support payment.

         This payment was introduced in November 1990 to offset the introduction of a charge for pharmaceutical benefits for people who have previously received prescriptions free under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. At that time, as an interim measure, advance payments of the allowance were introduced to assist pensioners of limited means, with high pharmaceutical requirements, to adjust to the changes in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Those pensioners eligible were then able to receive lump sum advances of the pharmaceutical allowance, rather than receive it fortnightly with their pension.

         The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) has some commendable features. As the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the opposition is not opposed to the general thrust of the bill. However, we have moved an amendment which I will strongly support.

As our amendment indicates, there are some people who are particularly adversely affected by these changes, and we are asking the government to review those particular aspects. On a number of occasions I have encountered difficulties where taxable income has not been adequate in determining the eligibility for a number of benefitsâ€”Austudy is one that comes to mindâ€”because of the various opportunities that particularly self-employed people have of circumventing that requirement by taking income in fringe benefits.

         It is a positive step to take foreign income into account in the income tests for family payments. The opposition supports the introduction of the seniors card as proposed in this legislation. I strongly support the making of foreign currency provisions in the Social Security Act more responsive to market exchange rates. I have had many pensioners who are getting benefits from overseas, and who have been adversely affected by the way those calculations are done. I applaud the initiative that has been taken to make them more responsive to market exchange rates. Although the opposition has not been opposed to this, I am not personally convinced of the restrictions that are being placed on the family payment.

         The family payment is now regarded as welfare. It was never intended to be welfare. When child endowment was introduced, which is what it was originally called, it was a recognition of the importance of children to our society. It was an encouragement for people to have children. It was a recognition of how much it cost to bring up children.

That is a horrifying thought to anyone, especially to those with young children. The point is that it does cost a lot of money. As originally implemented, child endowment was a recognition of that fact. It seems that the government has totally lost sight of that fact. The family payment is now being regarded as welfare and, in that sense, targeted on the same criterion as welfare is, and ought to be, targeted. I believe that we are losing sight of what family assistance really ought to be about.

That is not ideal and ought to be discouraged. The tax system, and all the other laws we implement, ought to be aimed at supporting families and keeping traditional families together. That is not overlooking the fact that there are single parent families. Whether that has occurred inadvertently or unfortunately, they all need recognition. I am not sure how far the Labor Party intends to go with its definition of families.

         It has all been downhill. The previous Labor government really set the whole thing in train with the Family Law Act. The late Lionel Murphy created many problems for us as a result of that. I am not advocating here, or anywhere else, a return to pre-1975 per se, but I do not think members in this place would not have constantly encountered, when back in their electorates, concern from either a husband or a wife about the fact that divorce has become so easy that it has led to a breakdown in families.

In my view we ought to encourage people to get married in the first place. It has been recognised that the spate of violent child murders and the amount of violence that generally exists almost all occur in the context of de facto relationships or in the broader context of a dysfunctional family. The connection is so obvious that it probably does not need to be stated, but it is a fact, and we need to recognise it. This government should be recognising it.

         The honourable member for McPherson bagged the idea of social justice but we could say that members of the opposition have suddenly become born-again bleeding hearts. The opposition has found a social conscience, which is absolutely astonishing for a would-be government that was going to slash Medicare, slash funding right across the board, and give us the GST that we had to have. But the electorate did not want that and will not want it in the future. The opposition needs to find itself some policies, otherwise its vandalism of the government's legislative program will become clear to the electorate. Basically, the electorate wants good economic management and a good government, and for that reason we will shortly find that the furore over the budget will die down.

In the end, she did not have the strength of purpose to cross the floor and support the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) which would have effectively withdrawn those provisions that are so badly affecting those people who find that, after making sacrifices during their working lives to save for retirementâ€”being in the position of owning shares and also receiving a pension incomeâ€”the unrealised capital gain on their shares is being assessed for the purposes of the income test for the age pension.

         The most notable of those is that children may be forced to change schools regularly. Spouses who are also employed may have difficulty gaining transfers or finding alternative employment. I will give an example of a posting cycle that is mentioned in the case of a major in the ADF. At one stage, he had lived in 11 houses in 16 years. One of his children in seven years had attended five primary schools in five states as well as in PNG, and the second child had attended four schools in four states in five years. As I have mentioned, from my experience as a member of an ADF family, that is a serious concern for those members of the ADF. There are very substantial sacrifices required on the part of ADF members as part of their duties, which of course include being able to be deployed throughout the Commonwealth and throughout those areas where the ADF is in fact stationed.

        But the measure being proposed by the government would substantially affect the remuneration which ADF members receive. What must be realised in this case is the specialisation of military employment. There is the need to be on call at all times and to work long and irregular hours; the need to live and work in uncomfortable conditions, short of those situations for which separate provision has been made; and the general turbulence in postings to the extent that such disruptions are not compensated in current allowance.

Last week I visited two of the Army bases in my electorate of Indiâ€”Bandiana and Bonegillaâ€”and spoke with many serving army personnel. On any other visit, or in my association with the defence forces throughout Australia over many years, I have never seen or witnessed such concern, anguish and anger from the members of the Defence Force as a result of the budget and the way in which the economy has been adversely affecting them.

         They told me there was an incredible and increasing number of members of the defence forces who were relying more and more on social security support. That is a matter that has to be evaluated. I think it bears scrutiny. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, it is a matter that I intend to pursue in the interests of good government in Australia. It is remarkable that people who take up careers in the defence forces of this nation are becoming increasingly reliant on social security to make ends meet, to provide for their families and to try to make up to their families for the substantial disruption that occurs because of the nature of their careers.

         I guess it is human nature that an employer who is looking for someone to fit into the organisation, perhaps to undergo training and take part in the enterprise, will give an edge to someone who is more likely to remain in the community for a longer period. That is just one example of the sorts of problems Defence Force families have. This legislation is an attempt to impose fringe benefits tax on some of the small but very important incentive payments available to Defence Force personnel. So rent subsidies that help families cope with transfers from one part of Australia to another or to overseas postings will attract the vigour of this legislation.

Defence Force people are pretty disciplined, as they have to be, but that was an experience that I do not want to repeat; to witness the depth of anger, disappointment, hurt and revulsion towards this governmentâ€”and towards the way the budget would retrospectively affect them.

         â€”With respect, the amendment expresses concern at the effects on low income families. I think it is clear that the content of my contribution establishes that there are low income families in the Defence Force. The government is attacking low income familiesâ€”not protecting them at all. I am illustrating the fact that the retrospective grab at accrued long service and annual leave of defence service personnel is immoral and not acceptable. The government has had to back off partially, as a result of doing a deal with the Australian Democrats. This has arisen only because the coalition has shown the courage to reject those sorts of taxes in the Senate.

They have to make decisions that affect their security and savings before the trigger date for the legislation in September. This shows that the Prime Minister is totally out of touch when he says in a vague and uncertain way that he is reviewing the legislation in respect of pensioners' shares when he ought to know damned well that the pensioners have to make decisions well before the trigger date this month as to what they will do with their shares.

         In conclusion, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, will be able to exert his influence on his colleagues in the cabinet. I am sure the caucus room would be available tonight for another emergency caucus meeting. The coalition would accommodate the parliamentary secretary if he wanted to defer discussion on this debate whilst we awaited the outcome of another caucus meeting. It is not a matter of the government being further humiliated; it is totally humiliated now. It is simply a matter of trying to get something out of the tatters of its fiscal mismanagement and the shocking budget that we are now trying to deal with. I hope honourable members will support the amendment. We can then get on with trying to rectify the havoc being caused to people due to this government's mismanagement.

         I have listened on many occasions to the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) put forward in many cases quite reasoned arguments in this place. He was a professional lawyer before he came into this House. Today's speech was probably one of his very ordinary ones because he did not have much zest. The reason is that he looked at the bill and found that everything we were doing involved very good measures, and in some cases measures those opposite would have included in their Fightback document. That document said that a lot of people were getting social security benefits who were not in need, and that the system was not properly targeted.

         The honourable member went back to 1941â€”over 50 years agoâ€”to find something which the Liberal Party of Australia had done for social justice. He talked about Menzies introducing child endowment in 1941. If we look through the opposition's record over all the years it was in government then we would probably have to go back 50 years to find an instance of it doing something equitable and looking after people in some way.

There is no question whatsoever that had those opposite achieved government at the March election, they would have taken this measure themselvesâ€”there is no doubt about that. It would have been the same with a number of other measures that we have taken.

         There is no question whatsoever that there is concern amongst the Australian Defence Force with respect to this measure. But I do not know whether the members of the Defence Force have looked at it and seen just how few of them will be affected. If we look first at the income test for the basic family payment and then the additional family payment, we find that, as of nowâ€”1993â€”before one loses entitlement to some form of basic family payment, the cut-off point is $64,938 per year. That is quite a high salary. In 1994 it is proposed by another legislation, which I introduced yesterday, to reduce that cut-off point to $60,000.

We must be talking here of somebody of the rank of general; possibly higher ranks than majors. Those opposite are crying crocodile tears. They are trying to find some excuse to criticise the bill because they know it is not that bad a measure and it is one which they would have taken had they been the government.

         Under the 1993 income test, a family can get the maximum rate of additional family payment if its income is below $20,950. The cut-out rate is about $25,494.80. I have not checked the figures, but I wonder how many of our Defence Force personnel would be on that sort of salary or less. I do not think that many of our Defence Force personnel would be earning a sufficiently low salary for them to be eligible for the additional family payment now.

         Having said that, I want to make a few other points. I certainly have a concern for the Australian Defence Force. The cabinet did give special consideration to this matter. I understand that it talked about it at length and looked at the concerns that were expressed. The rationale for the change is that taxable income does not indicate fully the need for government assistanceâ€”at the moment, it is based on taxable income. Employees who receive non-taxable benefits from an employer are better off than those on the same taxable income who receive no extra benefits.

         The government did consider separately the situation of families of Defence Force personnel and the impact on them of the inclusion of fringe benefits in income testing for government assistance. On equity grounds, however, the government affirmed the decision to apply to these families the same provisions as are to apply to the community generally.

         Clearly, this initiative may affect some families on relatively low taxable incomes who currently receive a housing allowance or subsidy from an employer. In this regard, Defence Force personnel are not placed differently from employees in local government, the mining industry, and education and railway authorities that also provide accommodation to staff in rural and remote areas or in recognition that mobility is a condition of employment. Similarly, employees of organisations other than the defence forces may be compensated for mobility through the provision of allowances to assist in meeting the cost of maintaining continuity of their children's schooling in a particular education system where the family so decides.

         The honourable member for Berowra expressed an interest in those living in non-metropolitan and remote areas. The approach taken in this bill to the assessing of the value of housing in country and remote areas is designed to avoid disadvantaging families who live in these areas. The maximum value which will be assigned to a three-bedroom house in a non-metropolitan area is $100 a week. In remote areas the maximum value of such a house is $80 a week. In metropolitan areas it is $140 a week. Only the difference between these maximum values and any lesser amount of rent paid is considered as an assessable fringe benefit. Then the first $1,000 of the fringe benefit value is disregarded.

A corporal living at Albury-Wodonga, which is classified as a country area, and contributing $65 a weekâ€”which I understand is about the usual amountâ€”toward the rental of his or her three-bedroom house, would have a fringe benefit value of $1,820. The first $1,000 would be disregarded, so only $820 would be included as income. The maximum reduction in family payment would be about $7.50 a week.

         I can understand, again, why the opposition is bringing up this matter. It is obviously for political reasons: it is trying to create some concern in the community. But on this occasion, once the measures are properly explained and when people look at the generous income limits for the basic family payment, I do not think there will be too many in the Defence Force, apart from those who really do not need to come to the social security systemâ€”those earning more than $64,000-odd a year; I would say, the fairly high ranking officersâ€”who will suffer.

         I do not think the Australian taxpayers really expect the government to be paying family allowance, or the basic family payment as it is now called, to people on those sorts of salaries.

         On the question of fringe benefits, I conclude by saying that I do not really think the opposition has much of a leg to stand on. As much as I know that people in the Defence Force who will be affected by this measure will be disappointed, we are not singling them out. It is not an attack on the defence forcesâ€”quite the contrary. It would have been wrong for the government to have excluded the defence forces from this measure and at the same time include, as I said before, teachers, railway workers and others who have to go out into the country and get special benefits as a result of that.

During the last term I spent a fair bit of time with the Association of Independent Retirees and self-funded retiree organisations. I admit that they have got stuck into me on many occasions. The first thing I say to them is that I have a thick skin so they can go for their life. In some cases, they have put up fairly good arguments as to why some of them, who are asset rich but income poor, do not get any assistance.

         So what have we done? First of all, we have brought inâ€”not by way of this bill but by way of another bill which has already been passed by this Houseâ€”the assets withdrawal rate. We have eased that. That was the first measure. That was as a result of many of my colleagues and me receiving representations from self-funded retiree organisationsâ€”many of them, Mr Deputy Speaker, live in your electorateâ€”who have said to us, `Sure we have assets, but because of the way interest rates have gone down and so forth we are not getting as much income as we were getting'.

         By introducing the seniors health card, we pick up 200,000 senior citizens who at the moment, because of the assets test, cannot access it. That is, in my view, an enormous measure and I am glad members of the opposition are not voting against it. They are supporting it, and so they should. The honourable member for Berowra says in his amendment:

         One of the other measures is to ensure that the income test for family payments takes account of foreign income. At the moment there are people who earn income from overseas sources. For instance, an airline pilot could be a resident of Australia but could be working for, say, Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong and earning fairly good money, which would normally bring him or her over and above the income test. The point is that we have now included that foreign income in the income test for family payment.

       As is evident from its terms, this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), under section 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Actâ€”the HREOC Actâ€”with respect to the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. The effect of the ministerial declaration was, subject to it not being disallowed by the Senate or this House, to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN declaration within the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights.

        Let me state at the outset that the general objectives of the UN declaration are laudable. They recognise that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and that no-one should be subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. However, the action of the former Attorney-General has given rise to grave concerns among a wide range of religious groups and members of the public. Those who have written to honourable members and senators include archbishops and bishops and representatives of a range of Christian and non-Christian groups. The main concern expressed is that the effect of incorporation of the UN declaration into the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act will be not to protect religious freedom in Australia but to limit it.

        The opposition accepts that the ministerial declaration does not of itself make the UN declaration part of Australia's domestic law. The UN declaration does not impose obligations on citizens as a statute does. The opposition also recognises that the powers of the Human Rights Commissioner contained in the HREOC Act in relation to investigating conduct that constitutes a breach of human rights are, in practical terms, confined to the actions of the Commonwealth and its agencies.

        Accordingly, it is accepted that some of the more extreme fears that have been voiced, and in particular those which suggest that the UN declaration operates to curtail the religious freedom of individuals, are difficult to sustain. Nonetheless, there are compelling reasons why the former Attorney-General's declaration should be disallowed.

        The UN declaration must be seen in context. On 7 December 1962 the General Assembly of the United Nations initiated the preparation of a draft declaration and a draft convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance. However, it was not until 1981, after 19 years of tortuous drafting and negotiation, that the declaration was finally adopted.

        In UN practice, a declaration by the General Assembly is usually a step in the process of settling a convention or treaty. The convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance has yet to be finalised, even though it is now almost 31 years since its drafting was initiated. The delay in finalising the declaration and the apparent inability of the United Nations to agree upon the terms of a convention reflect not only political struggles within the United Nations but also the controversy inherent in the subject matter.

        Let us look at the circumstances under which the former Attorney-General put his signature to his declaration under the HREOC Act. The UN declaration was adopted by a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 25 November 1981. Although Australia supported the resolution in 1981, it was not until 1993, nearly 12 years later, that the former Attorney-General declared it under the HREOC Act.

        The actual date on which he did so is also significant: it was 8 February this year, the day after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the federal election. Some months before, the former Attorney-General had consulted state governments. Attorney-General Hannaford of New South Wales advised that the New South Wales Liberal government opposed the incorporation of the UN declaration in the HREOC Act. So did Attorney-General Berinson QC of the Western Australian Labor government.

        The question must be asked: what prompted the former Attorney-General to sign his declaration 10 years after the matter had come before his government and on the day after a federal election was announced, an election which the government was generally expected to lose? In looking at the incorporation of the UN declaration in the HREOC Act, the first point to be made is that the UN declaration is not a treaty. Australia is not bound at international law to comply with the terms of the UN declaration, nor is it bound to incorporate its provisions into Australian domestic law.

        The next point to be made is that within the existing definition of human rights in the HREOC Act, the commission has ample power to promote the concept of religious freedom and to investigate infringements of that freedom by the Commonwealth or its agencies.

        The declaration goes further and in article 6 expressly states what those freedoms include. I will quote a few of these. One freedom is to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions. What constitutes `appropriate charitable institutions'? Another function is to make, acquire and use to an adequate extent the necessary articles and material related to the rites or customs of a religion or belief. What is `an adequate extent' and what, indeed, are necessary articles and materials as opposed to unnecessary ones?

        These provisions are an attempt to codify to some degree religious rights and freedoms, but they give rise to a multitude of questions of interpretation.

However, article 5(3) of the UN declaration provides that the child shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship among peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, respect for freedom of religion or belief of others and in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be devoted to the service of his fellow man.

        â€”Firstly, I acknowledge the spirit in which the motion has been moved by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). He wishes there to be an opportunity, and I acknowledge that, for the parliament to be able to debate this particular instrument. It is certainly an important instrument which has been adopted by the government and which is now added to the armoury, if you like, of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is appropriate that it be debated. Indeed, the very mechanism of this process allows a disallowance motion to occur.

        The first point which the honourable member raised implied that there is something a little sinister about it all, that it was signed up in the last days of the previous government at a time when it was widely believed that the government may not be returned.

        The honourable member then went on to ask where all this came from and why, after such a long period of time, it was picked up by the government and added again to the HREOC armoury. Initial support for this declaration occurred in 1981 and came from the Fraser government, not a Labor government. The declaration was picked up in recent times because of a request by the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, who would be well known to honourable members of this House as a very distinguished Australian. He is a former justice of the High Court and a man who, I believe, would not be prone to embarking on enterprises which would somehow limit the rights and enjoyment of religious freedom in this country. He is also a man who has some knowledge of the law, both internationally and domestically, the operation of the United Nations and the impact a declaration such as the one we are debating will have on Australian law. Obviously, Sir Ronald Wilson did not see the evil which the honourable member for Tangney believes could be incorporated in this particular measure.

        When the request for the declaration was made, Australia and in fact the world was going through the Gulf War, when some concern was being directed in the Australian community at those of the Muslim faith. That was one of the major reasons that motivated the request from the human rights commission to the government to go down this path.

        The honourable member also raised the question of consultation, implying that the whole thing was a bit rushed. He suggested that the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr Hannaford, and the then Attorney-General of Western Australia had expressed some concerns about the declaration and, as a result, we should have stepped back and said, `We should not proceed with it'. Of course, the honourable member did not go on to mention that that consultation was not confined to the Attorneys-General of New South Wales and Western Australia. Consultation occurred through all Attorneys-General and no objection at all was raised to the declaration by the other states.

      <para first-indent="16">

        The more substantive objection was raised by Attorney-General Hannaford and was based on a belief that this declaration may have an impact on some of the exemptions provided in New South Wales anti-discrimination laws to particular religious practices. Indeed, as the honourable member mentioned, it was a broader measure which means that at some time we will have to sit down and resolve the potential conflict between declarations of religious freedom like this one and anti-discrimination provisions where the actual religious belief may be discriminatory in some way.

        That is a matter which we should be particularly concerned about because, on the face of it, there could be conflict. They are matters of judgment and balance. But the particular point which the Attorney-General of New South Wales raised simply was not valid in that this declaration will have no impact on the laws of New South Wales. As the honourable member said, this declaration will empower the human rights commission to certainly examine the actions and practices of the Commonwealth and promote broad understanding and education in areas of religious freedom. It is certainly not an instrument which of itself can invalidate the laws of any state or any discrimination laws in New South Wales. I think that point was even acknowledged by the Attorney-General of Western Australia in his objection. I stress that the other states did not object to the declaration at that time.

        Also, the human rights commission undertook wide consultations. As honourable members may know, Sir Ronald Wilson is well known as a senior official I think in the Uniting Church. He is also well known amongst churches generally.

        I am certainly advised that the position related by Sir Ronald back to the government was that there is widespread support for the declaration amongst churches. That is not to say there has not been a certain amount of misinformation and misunderstanding about this declaration. Like opposition members and senators, before the election, as a backbench member, I also received letters about this matter expressing a whole range of concerns. It was similar to the campaign which was run regarding the rights of the child, and no doubt we will discuss that a little later tonight.

        I do not deny that many right-minded people become concerned with the information or misinformation given to them and write in good faith to their members of parliament to express that concern. But I have also no doubt that a lot of this misinformation does come from some quite extreme and fringe groups in the community, from my experience at least within my home state. Often the League of Rights or kin organisations are rather prone to getting themselves involved with this issue, based on the idea that Australia is losing its sovereignty and that we are moving to a one world government. It is all tied up with the direction of the High Court in the dams case, the destruction of the legal system as we know it and Australia being brought to its knees. It used to have a communist undertone but with the collapse in Russia and eastern Europe, that undertone seems to have dropped out of the most recent letters I have seen. Nonetheless, the one-world conspiracy theory is often there.

Inasmuch as it is a government failure that this misunderstanding exists in the community, I have to accept the blame for that.

With this instrument, HREOC has a more modern statement of basic religious rights and freedoms than that contained in the underlying document, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which also canvasses political freedoms. It enables the body to go out and promote the idea of religious freedom. I do not think that it will be trying to strike down anti-discrimination laws or questioning thingsâ€”

        â€”Mr Speaker, the opposition moves to disallow the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, just as it has also moved to disallow the United Nations Declaration on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The National and Liberal parties have chosen this course of action because the two declarations are an insult to the Australian community, and an insult to the legal and constitutional traditions through which we conduct our affairs as an independent nation.

        Twelve years ago, it was deemedâ€”I suspect for reason of diplomatic nicetyâ€”to endorse a set of abstract principles regarding the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. This was hardly perceived to be a problem as the principles were of no more significance than that, and they were quite some considerable distance from intruding into the domestic legal system. That is where they should have stayed.

Effectively, what the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has done in respect of the declaration is to bring it within the ambit of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In other words, the ministerial declaration gazetted on 24 February this year, and tabled in both Houses in May, had the effect of drawing principles espoused in the original declaration, its variously phrased freedoms and rights in respect of religious activities, within the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

I am perturbed, as are others in this parliament and in the wider community, that we are becoming increasingly preoccupied with finding solutions to alleged problems through legal recourse or remedies.

That is, the essential traditions and character of the nation are increasingly falling into the hands of bureaucrats and lawyers who arbitrate and conciliate on all manner of concerns. The capacity of the community to regulate its own conduct, to set its own standards and be guided by the leadership of public figures is waning as a result. That says a great deal about a lot of forces operating across society. But it also says a great deal about the role of this parliament in national life and the decline of public leadership in setting the temper of the times.

I answered in the affirmative, whereupon there was spontaneous applause.

He consulted with state ministers before signing the declaration. The level of consultation was obviously appropriate having regard to the commission's responsibilities.

        The attorneys-general of Western Australian and New South Wales raised a number of concerns. The Western Australian Attorney-General was concerned about the effect of the declaration on the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Act 1984 and the exemptions provided for in that actâ€”in particular, the exemptions granted to religious bodies in section 72. However, he recognised that this would not pose a legal problem unless the religion declaration itself was enacted by the Commonwealth. There is no intention to do this. The New South Wales Attorney-General was of the opinion that the law and practice of New South Wales did not currently comply with the requirements of the religion declaration. However, the issue of any inconsistency between state legislation and the religion declaration does not arise in the context of making the declaration under the HREOC Act. Obviously, the objections raised during the consultation period to making that declaration lacked substance. Given the attitude of the majority of state attorneys-general, I understand that the then Attorney-General decided to proceed with the declaration.

The HREOC will also be able to inquire into acts or practices of the Commonwealth which are inconsistent with the rights contained in the UN declaration. What is wrong with that? Does the opposition want us to withdraw from the UN? Does it want us to be one out in the world? Why are we in the UN? The HREOC will also be able to examine Commonwealth legislation to determine whether it is consistent with the rights in the UN declaration, and it can report to the Commonwealth Attorney-General on action that should be taken by the Commonwealth on matters relating to the human rights. That is part of the answer that I gave to my constituents.

        I also saidâ€”and this is important because this is where there is a misinformation that people are feeding offâ€”that the reality is that the more they inquire or the more that it is explained to them, they will find that there is no substance to the fear or to the misinformation. The UN declaration does not restrict or limit Christians or members of other religions in the practice of their religion. The declaration and the rights recognised in it are aimed at ensuring the protection of freedom of religion. This intention is clearly reflected in two paragraphs in the preamble which states in part:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . Considering that religion or belief for anyone who professes either is one of the fundamental elements of his conception of life and that freedom of religion or belief should be fully respected and guaranteed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would have thought that that would have been motherhood stuff, even for the opposition. It continued:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . concerned by manifestations of intolerance and by the existence of discrimination in matters of religion or belief still in evidence in some areas of the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, what is the objection with that? Article 1 of the UN declaration says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
      </para>
      <para>
       It says further:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have a religion or belief of his choice . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       That is written there. It is a manifesto that we should be abiding by. The ALP has a manifesto; it has beliefs that we work to. I would have thought that the Liberal Party and the National Party also have beliefs and manifestos that they work and aspire to. The interesting thing is that those who should and do know at each stage of the process at the United Nations have let the matters go through unanimously; no votes were recorded against it. But what happens here? The politicians have to be involved, arguing the politics of the matter. They think that there might be something in it for them, that there is something else behind it. The reality is that there is nothing behind it. The declaration itself is motherhood stuff.

We are going to knock the opposition for six next time around as well. I have no problems with this matter being debated. On Monday of this week Sir Ronald Wilson attended a seminar conducted by the Australian Human Rights Council, which looked at human rights complaints mechanisms; why use them and how to use them. In the course of answering questions from the audience he made reference to the current disallowance motions by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and he urged members of the audience to write to both the Attorney-General and the shadow Attorney-General protesting the disallowance.

       (3) Freedom to manifest one's religion or belief may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. This article allows for Governments (secular persons) to intervene on Religious matters and arbitrate for the individual, which might not necessarily be to the benefit of the community as a whole. Minority religious groups could claim discrimination by larger Religious Groups e.g. Government Assistance by way of grants etc.

Religion therefore has no place in school's curriculum.

        I am trying to be even-handed. The Attorney-General says, `Relax, it will not have the effect of law; do not worry about it'. I am quite sure that he is sincere in what he is saying. Equally, it is important to say, `Why do we not accept the disallowance motion of the shadow Attorney-General and allow further consultation and allow such groups to be brought in to discuss the matter and perhaps make some changes?'. That is the basis on which I support the motion of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams).

        â€”in replyâ€”I will reply briefly to comments by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). The honourable member for Banks seems to think that, if he replies to a letter from a constituent rejecting what the constituent has asserted, the constituent accepts it because the constituent does not do anything more about it. That is not a reason for suggesting that the concerns of those people who write letters to honourable members and senators on this subject are not genuine.

        The honourable member for Banks pointed to the fact that the original declaration was adopted unanimously in the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1981. He neglected to point out that the negotiation and drafting of that document by then had taken 19 years. The similarity between that and the current budget proposal, with its tortuous negotiation and flexible terms, is apparent.

        The honourable member for Banks also mentioned the original request from Sir Ronald Wilson regarding the declaration. For the record, his correct name is Sir Ronald Wilson, not Sir Roland Wilson, as he has been called tonight on a number of occasions. One would not doubt his integrity or intentions in making his request. The dramatic circumstances which prompted him to make that request for the declaration highlight that the push for this declaration does not come from within Australia. He was responding to the request of a world congress for religion and peace. Internationally, there is justification for an inadequate document being promoted for the purposes for which it is used. Within Australia, there is no similar need. We do not have a problem with child prostitution or child slavery as there is in some other countries. An international request for domestic law can be responded to only by reference to domestic requirements.

        Turning to the comments of the Attorney-General, the reason for the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), signing the declaration to enable its operation under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act was identified as being the circumstances at the time of the Gulf War. At that time incidents were reported of individuals of non-Muslim faith interfering with women, particularly of Muslim faith, wearing purdah, the Muslim dress. The promulgation of the declaration under the HREOC Act has no effect on that. That is one of the points made by the Attorney-General himself. In order to meet the express need, all we need to do is rely on the provisions of the ICCPR which promote religious tolerance in general terms. We do not need to go to the further detail, because it has no relevance.

        The Attorney-General mentioned that the declaration had no impact on the laws of New South Wales, as addressed by Attorney-General Hannaford and the then Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr Berinson. It is not asserted by us that it does. But it has to be remembered that two functions of the commission are relevant: the promotion of an acceptance and understanding of human rights and a function of investigating complaints of breaches or infringements of human rights by Commonwealth authorities and agencies. If the Commonwealth, through its agency, the commission, is to promote an understanding and acceptance of human rights and religious freedom and tolerance in particular, it should not be doing it in a way that gives rise to a conflict with state legislation. That is the point made by the two Attorneys-General. That point has not been answered in any way by the Attorney-General.

        The Attorney-General also suggested that under the declaration the commission will not be pushing onto people social philosophy of its own invention. But the point must be made again that one of the functions of the commission is to promote an acceptance and understanding of religious tolerance and freedom. It does that by reference to whatever instruments are declared under the act. Prior to the declaration on 8 February, it did it by reference to the ICCPR; now it does it by reference to the declaration. What is being promoted is not the commission's version of social philosophy but that which is set out in the declaration. That is why it is so important to have regard to the terms of the declaration.

        The Attorney-General passed off as if it were of no moment that there may be conflicts between the instruments already declared under the act. The opposition's view is that that should be resolved before a declaration is made. It would be a simple matter if the government did its job rather than wait to let the commission do the job by promoting inconsistent policies within the Australian community. In nothing that has been said by the government is there an answer to the arguments put by the opposition in favour of this motion.

       Like the previous motion, this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), under subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, the HREOC Act, in this case with respect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The effect of this declaration was to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN convention within the definition of `human rights' for the purposes of that act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights.

        At the outset, I wish to make it clear that the coalition is not opposed to the convention itself. This has always been the case. In this regard, I refer to the speech made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in this House on 21 February 1991, just after ratification of the convention by Australia. In that speech it was made clear that the coalition, had it been in government, would have ratified the convention, but would have done so with reservations to particular articles of the convention so as to make its interpretation crystal clear. The coalition, therefore, in bringing this motion is not attacking the convention, but is rather questioning its incorporation into the HREOC Act in light of its ratification by Australia without any reservations as to its interpretation. It should also be understood that the coalition is not seeking by this motion to criticise the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

        The origins of the convention can be traced back to the Declaration of Geneva on the rights of the child, which was adopted by the League of Nations in 1924 in response to the needs of children after World War I. That declaration contained five principles which were general but to the point. For example, one was that children should be the first to receive relief in an emergency.

        The United Nations adopted its own Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959, which enunciates 10 principles to guide parents, governments and voluntary organisations in their treatment of children. These principles include: non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or political opinion; enjoyment of special treatment under the law; entitlement to a name and nationality at birth; enjoyment of social security benefits; provision of education; and protection against neglect, cruelty and exploitation.

        In 1979 the United Nations Human Rights Committee commenced drafting a convention dealing with children's rights. The resulting convention on the rights of the child was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989 and came into force internationally upon receiving its 20th ratification on 2 September 1990. Prior to the ratification of this convention by Australia, there was great concern in Australia about the potential effect of the convention on family life in this country. There was particular concern about its potential to undermine parental rights and responsibilities, particularly in so far as these rights concern education, religion, association with others and privacy.

        Concerns regarding those key articles of the convention and how they affect parental rights have resurfaced with the incorporation of the convention into the HREOC Act. Prior to ratification of the convention by Australia, Senator Evans responded to those concerns by dismissing them as `lunatic misapprehensions'. This did absolutely nothing to set the minds of the public at rest. The only concession to these concerns in this House were references by government representatives to the preamble and article 5 of the convention and to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which sets out rules for the interpretation of international treaties.

Article 5 states that the parties to the convention shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or persons legally responsible for the child to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the convention.

What appear to be absolute rights of children set out in articles 12 to 16 and 28 are arguably not sufficiently qualified by the vague reference to the family in the preamble.

        Unlike the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the subject matter of the convention on the rights of the child is already the subject of wide-ranging legislation in Australia. According to an April 1989 paper prepared by a working group on behalf of the Australian Council of Social Service, existing government law and policies appeared generally consistent with the articles of the convention. That report also pointed out that, because there is no specification of what is meant by terms such as social security, nor any detailing of other requirements, it is difficult to determine clearly the question of compliance in relation to particular issues.

        In November 1989, Justice Elizabeth Evatt of the Australian Law Reform Commission indicated that in order to bring Australian laws into basic conformity with the convention it might be necessary for legislative action to be taken in many areas, including family law, marriage, children's legal services, social security and adoption. Despite these observations, ratification of the convention took place without the passage of enabling legislation either at the state or territory level or the Commonwealth level. When questioned by Senator Durack on 22 November 1989 as to whether the government had examined state child welfare laws in relation to many of the matters covered by the convention and made any judgment about their adequacy to protect the rights of Australian children, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) stated that in the government's judgment no Australian law was in contravention of the provisions of the convention.

Relevant international instruments are defined to be those declared under section 47 of the act.

        That does not mean that it should not be debated, but I do not believe that at this stage we should be trying to disallow the whole instrument. The honourable member for Tangney has stated as a starting point that, firstly, the coalition does not oppose the convention but does oppose certain aspects of itâ€”most particularly the fact that there is not a reservation to a number of the articles. The idea of a reservation would be to make it clear that the rights of the children canvassed in these particular articles must be read in light of the pre-eminence to be given to the family in the role of parents.

        Two lines were advanced in support of this argument. The first line was that former Senator Tate, when questioned about this matter in the Senate, basically gave an undertaking that there would be such a reservation and that reservation was not made. The honourable member quoted Senator Tate, but he did not finish the quoteâ€”in fact he finished halfway through the sentence. The honourable member quoted Senator Tate as saying, `It would be surprising were that not the case'â€”implying that there was a full stop. In fact, that was a comma. Senator Tate then went on to say:

       . . . given the fact that Australia inserted article 5, meaning that for the first time in the international community a document was open to ratification which recognised that pre-eminent role of the family, parents or legal guardians in giving guidance and direction to children in accordance with their evolving capacities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Tate was saying that the government recognised the pre-eminent importance of parents in the family. Indeed, Australia was instrumental in inserting article 5, which inserted this requirement into the convention in the first place, and it would be surprising if Australia were not completely and totally supportive of it. I think it is a little bit misleading to attribute that to former Senator Tate.

        If we go on from that point, the next line of argument was that the Holy See had made such a reservation and this was evidence that Australia should likewise have had such a reservation. As much as I have been able to ascertain from the checks my department has been able to doâ€”I do not pretend that this may be absolutely gospelâ€”no other country has made a reservation along the lines being proposed by the honourable member tonight and by the coalition over the last couple of years. The Holy See has, but none of the well over 100 or so countries which have ratified this convention has made a similar reservation. Despite the honourable member saying it was only arguable whether the convention has to be interpreted in light of the preamble in article 5, no-one else seems to have the same difficulty in interpreting the preamble.

        Let us not be so timid and meek about the ability of the human rights commission or governmentsâ€”or courts, if it came down to thatâ€”to actually interpret this document properly. It is quite clear that the document has to be read as a whole, and that article 5 does mean that those specific articles referring to education, religion, privacy and what-have-you, as the honourable member mentioned, are to be read in accordance with that particular article. As best as I have been able to determine, other countries have not considered it necessary to put such a motion.

        The other line of argument that the honourable member advanced was that the correct procedure which should be followed with ratifications and when adding instruments to the armoury of the human rights commission is to undergo a check to see whether all Australian laws comply with the test which will be set down by this particular convention. Only if all the laws did in fact comply would we then add the convention to the human rights commission's armoury.

        In saying that, the honourable member skirted rather quickly around the fact that Australia is a federation. Obviously the Commonwealth has control over its own laws and actions, but it has far less controlâ€”nor should it have controlâ€”over the laws and actions of state governments. While it may well be sound practice for an examination to be undertaken of the existing law of the country to check whether the convention is complied with, I do not believe it is any argument at all to say that we think a law in Tasmania or a law operating in Queensland may not comply and therefore we will not ratify or take any further action on this convention until the parliament of that state amends its laws accordingly.

I commend the views of the Law Council of Australia to the House, and I ask honourable members to think seriously about this before casting their votes. I think it is very straightforward. This disallowance motion should not be supported.

        â€”I do not support the motion for the disallowance of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child because, obviously, I support the inclusion of the definition of `human rights' concerning the declaration of the rights of the child in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. I do so because it is very important indeed that we have the right signals in relation to the protection of children both inside and outside Australia. We should join the international community in sending those signals.

        In opposing this motion I refer to a reservation that the originator of the motion said might have been contemplated when the treaty was ratified by the Australian government. He said:

      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . a reservation was not made acknowledging the pre-eminent role of the family so that in effect the Articles of the Convention would be interpreted in a way that safeguarded the primary and inalienable rights of parents;
      </para>
      <para>
       A very significant change was made and included in article 5 at the request of the Australian government. However, I go back to the definition of what would be the `primary and inalienable rights of parents'.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I suppose we could come to some sort of broad definition of `primary' but what would be `inalienable'? Parents have rights that are not inalienable. A parent may not deny a child an education; a parent may not injure a child. If a parent does either of those things, those children can be taken away by the state. It is not an inalienable right to injure children, and so it would be very difficult to insert those definitions.

        What has the Human Rights Commissioner said? I quote from a communication that he sent to members in the latter part of last month:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Clearly, the family generally provides the best protection for the rights of children. However, families often need assistance to help them fulfil their responsibilities. Tragically, tens of thousands of children in Australia lack the protection of a family at all. For these reasons this Commission strongly supports the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
      </para>
      <para>
       Why would he do that? We should read the convention if we ask that question. From the preamble to the convention I selected this paragraph:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Recognising that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another paragraph says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Recognising that, in all countries in the world, there are children living in exceptionally difficult conditions, and that such children need special consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       Article 2 says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians, or family members.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, article 5 covers the question of a reservation. It says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the present Convention.
      </para>

       That is as clear a definition of family responsibility for children as one can consistently and sensibly put in there.

       These words `human rights' are used in the Act in order to define the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission . . . they include the function of examining enactments or bills for the purposes of ascertaining whether they are inconsistent with any human right, and inquiring into and endeavouring to conciliate complaints where the Commission considers that an act or practice may be inconsistent with any human right. The Commission may report to the Minister upon any action which the Commission considers needs to be taken by Australia in order to comply with the provisions of any `international instrument' and it may prepare and publish guidelines for the avoidance of acts or practices which are inconsistent with or contrary to any human right. The Commission is also granted educative, research and promotional functions in relation to human rights, and the right, with the leave of the court, to intervene in any proceedings that involve human rights issues.

         â€”A constituent came into my office in Bendigo today. His name is Mr Andrew. He lives in Bendigo and is married. He has one child. His wife works in a government job earning about $27,000 a year. Mr Andrew is unemployed and has been for some time. He qualified for the jobstart allowance, having been out of work for six months. He finally got a job and the employer collected the jobstart subsidy. When the subsidy ran out after the 16-week period, Mr Andrew says that he lost his job because the employer could not afford to pay the full wage, although Mr Andrew was kept on for a further two weeks. Now he has no job, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training has told him he has to be unemployed for another six months before being eligible for the jobstart subsidy again.

         As he pointed out, few employers will put anyone on without the subsidy. He is not eligible for unemployment benefits because his wife works. I ask the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley)â€”who I saw briefly in the chamber but apparently he has left; perhaps the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, would be kind enough to take up this issue with himâ€”why a person who qualifies for the subsidy and is lucky enough to get work is then forced to start all over again to requalify just because of being unable to find a job, even though the job has been a short-term one.

They would then get all of the benefits available, such as a health care card and all the other benefits. I ask the minister at the table to take up that matter with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.

          â€”I wish to refer tonight to two historians. Firstly, I refer to the recent controversy with respect to the Australian historian Manning Clark that was initiated by an article by Peter Ryan in that well-known journal
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Quadrant
          </emphasis>
          . I would like to say that that particular attack was essentially a politically motivated attack which comes from what I would describe as the old Right within the Australian community, which has for a long time felt very keenly the lack of intellectuals in the literary and historical arena on the right of the political spectrum. That part of the community has been keen to ensure that people such as Manning Clark, who has been seen to have essentially Left-oriented perspectives on Australian history in society, should be denigrated and torn down.

          Certainly one can put forward evidence that Manning Clark made some inaccurate references in some of his volumes. His style was a bit florid, but there is no doubt that there have been many Australians who have been inspired to an interest and a love of Australian history by Manning Clark's works. I, like numerous other people in this House, studied some of his works as a student. They have certainly been an inspiration to people who, in earlier days, had been brought up on history that essentially regarded Australia as a footnote to the British empire.

          For the first time, we had a historian who was pursuing an independent and nationally identifiable orientation with Australian history. So I would like to place on record my deep disappointment at Mr Peter Ryan's attack, and to indicate that it is in keeping with his previously expressed political views in a number of other areas. It is essentially a politically motivated attack with limited substance. I suggest to the House the fact that Manning Clark may have, on one or two occasions, actually committed the severe crime of being a bit drunk before a lecture is hardly the basis to impugn his reputation as a historian.

          The other historian that I would like to refer to is somebody whom honourable members opposite have probably never heard of, but never mind, and that is E.P. Thompson. Edward Palmer Thompson, amongst other achievements, was vice-president of the campaign for nuclear disarmament in England. He was also a founding member of the European nuclear disarmament movement, and the author of the seminal work
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           The Making of the English Working Class
          </emphasis>

          E.P. Thompson inspired and influenced a whole generation of historians, not only in England but in other countries, including Australia. I feel it is appropriate that his passing on the weekend be noted in this way because he has made a substantial contribution to intellectual debate, not only in his own country but in Europe and in this country as well. He was also a leading figure in a great international causeâ€”nuclear disarmament.

         â€”Over the last few months, what has been overlooked in the debate that we have had on Maboâ€”the claims and counterclaimsâ€”is the future and the plight of 20,000 Australians who are of South Sea Islander descent. I mention this because it has been in only the recent five to six years that these people have been segregated further still, falling outside the limb of any assistance they might have had available under ATSIC in the past. Not being indigenous people, they have now been sidelined, and they are probably the most deprived of the ethnic groups in Australia. As I have said, I understand that there are about 15,000 to 20,000 of these Australians in this situation.

         Within the last couple of months, and in amongst the Mabo dispute, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission has published the report
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The call for recognition
         </emphasis>
         . The main points of that report are set out in a statement
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         , which states:

        . . . the report concludes that Australia's South Sea Islanders have suffered from a century of racial discrimination and harsh treatment. This has contributed to their being one of the most disadvantaged groups in Australia. School retention, employment skills, home ownership and health are identified as areas of particular need.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The report also notes that governments have denied South Sea Islanders recognition as a distinct black minority group. Until recently it was common for South Sea Islanders to access government programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However this access is now being denied and the South Sea Islanders are being forced into mainstream programs which are culturally inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report calls for actionâ€”and awaits the actionâ€”by both state and federal governments. The Queensland government also has a responsibility in this regard. In my own area, there are an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 people who are descendants of what used to be known as a proud Kanaka race. Their history is a very proud one as far as the development of the sugar industry and their community are concerned, and the means by which they have accepted Christianity.

         They have kept their heritage and have kept their traditions, yet they are being denied any access to what had been mainstream programs. Certainly their traditions and culture are there. I would like to put on record that probably one of the greatest contributors from the South Sea Islander community presently captains the Australian Kangaroos. I think that is a mark of respect to the man himself, and also his acknowledgment of the people he represents.

         The history of discrimination against these people by older Australians is not a proud one. If honourable members look back to the  blackbirding from the islands from 1875 onwards, they might recall the savage repatriation of these people to the islands when there was a tremendous and indiscriminate loss of life. That was the first discrimination.

         Because they are not indigenous people, they have no entitlement under ATSIC. There is a discrimination, as the report indicates, in housing, health, legal affairs and education. I mention legal affairs particularly because they do not have access to ATSIC legal services. Another point is that there is no recognition of these people as a significant ethnic group as there is with many others within the community. So I say without a doubt that the South Sea Islanders are a most disadvantaged group within our society.

         I had a particularly good friend of South Sea Islander extractionâ€”Mr Noel Fatnowna, who died early in 1991. He was one of the recognised citizens of Mackay. I do not say `black citizens'; I say `recognised citizens'. He was recognised for his voluntary work, his help within the ambulance service and everything else that was associated with things we like to call good in Australia. He had a book written, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Fragments of a Lost Heritage
         </emphasis>
         , which details the history of South Sea Islanders in Australiaâ€”how they came here and what has been their lot since.

         He had the one common theme that if we live in Australia we are all Australians. But in fact these people are not being treated as we are treated, although he was proud to be an Australian. I think it is very important that the six recommendations in the report be acted upon quickly in order that we can end this discrimination and bring these people into mainstream Australia so that they can confidently be called proper and proud Australians.

         â€”One of the most memorable and inspiring events I have attended since becoming the member for Leichhardt occurred one afternoon last April on Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, in my electorate. On that day I represented the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and presented the government's position and sat in on several workshops to develop a Torres Strait health strategy. It was an inspiring occasion for me because of the dedication and determination that I sensed in the participants. There was a sense of new opportunities opening up and a resolve to turn around unacceptable health statistics by adopting local control at the community level. To be frank, the statistics are totally unacceptable by any standards. The current life expectancy of the people of the Torres Strait region is some 23 years less than for people in the rest of Australia and Torres Strait women have a life expectancy that is 30 years less.

         The three-day workshop in April was a forum for presenting and discussing the requirements and priorities of the Torres Strait community. There were representatives from community and government organisations, health workers, island council chairmen and individuals concerned with the current health status and facilities provided in the region. The primary aim was to gather information from individuals on exactly what health issues need to be addressed and to determine the most effective and culturally appropriate manner in which to address them. This information was gathered together and presented in one document.

It is vitally important, because of the statistics that I have referred to earlier, that the government give total support to this strategy. I will be doing everything I can to urge both state and federal governments to support the people of the Torres Strait so that we can do something about the appalling health statistics to which I referred earlier.

For some time I have had major concerns that we are largely superfluous in this place as the executive runs roughshod over the parliament and drives issue after issue through this House under gag and under guillotine. Honest to goodness, since this House has resumed for the budget sitting, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in a fit of anger directed at the Senate for having had the audacity to set time limits on presentation of important bills for consideration has effectively closed the House down as a democratic institution.

Those mistakes in English have created great concern in my electorate.

Subsequently, the then shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), raised the issue in private members time on Thursday morning and two speakers from each side were allowed to debate the issue briefly. It has not had wide canvass or debate in this parliament.

We have too frequently seen parents disappointed by actions taken by state communities.

I believe a mistake has been made in this place tonight and that democracy has been seriously curtailed in gagging once again the right of representatives to debate important issues.

         â€”I rise tonight to speak on this adjournment debate to raise an issue involving the west of my electorate. The Raglan Range is an area that has been logged since the 1930s and was given World Heritage status several years ago. The Bradshaw family has worked this area for many years, pulling sawlogs and transporting them along the Raglan Range Road to mill them in their mills. When this area achieved World Heritage status several years ago the road was closed off. The road had a gate put across it and it was left for walkers and traditional users. Two months ago the state division of parks, wildlife and heritage decided to rehabilitate the road. This is the essence of my concern tonight.

         The state division of parks, wildlife and heritage took on a value system which I believe has affected us in Tasmania for the past 10 or 15 years. It is of great concern to many of us. Its position is that traditional uses of land and cultural values from our history should be done away with. Areas of land which have been used for logging, hunting and fishing for many years have now been world heritage listedâ€”and so these traditional things can no longer be done.

         If world heritage status is to mean anything, it should also give recognition to the cultural values of areas, not just their scenic or spiritual valueâ€”or whatever someone else feels is its value. The value system which has enraged many Tasmaniansâ€”probably it is one of the issues on which I was elected to parliamentâ€”has been imposed on the Raglan Range Road.

         Two months ago, under the Tasmanian minister, John Cleary, parks and wildlife, as part of the management plan for the area, decided to rehabilitate the road. The road is made of gravel, with drains on each side, and incorporated along the road are several landings for logging trucks to load up. Over time, they have been taken back by the bush. The road gives a view of the history of the area and of the logging people that worked in a very traditional and hard way over many years. Somebody decided that the road could be seen from the Frenchmans Cap national park walking track and had to be removed; it interfered with somebody's values.

         Returning the road to its natural state of prior to the 1930s meant putting some natural cover back on it, at a cost of $20,000. That should not have happened. A heck of a mess has been created along this road, with broken trees and great disruption to the old track. Nothing useful has been achieved. In recent years in Tasmania we have undertaken a forest practices code. I believe that if the people who had imposed this work were subject to that code, they would shortly be going to court.

         I am sure that honourable members would be aware that recent land use arguments between people on the Greens side and those with traditional work values and ways of doing things have taken up a lot of time. Some of the animosity has subsided. I certainly do not wish to revisit the damming of the Franklin or to advocate the pulling of the plug on Lake Pedder. But we must be sensitive to everybody's needs in Tasmania. The west coasters, who have always stood up strongly for their beliefs and traditions, are finding the attitude being applied totally indefensible. The state government spent another $20,000 just down the road at Nelson Falls to create a track into the wilderness area so that somebody could have a natural walking track, when Raglan Range Road could have been used.

          I would have spoken on the adjournment last night about some statements that were made in this House yesterday, but I was too late in the door and the House rose at 10.30 p.m. However, things that have happened today have continued the issueâ€”and I am pleased that I did not speak on the matter then. Events today have underlined what I was going to raise last night. When the 1993-94 budget mark 1 was issued, Treasury analysis showed its very regressive nature. It showed, for example, that certain items were left out of the calculations of how people would be affected. The Treasury analysis did not take into account the impact of the 1 July 1995 increase in sales tax and the effect that would have particularly on low income earners.

          However, the analysis did show a number of startling things which have been very disturbing to the opposition, at least to the backbench of the government, and to the Australian community at large. Essentially, it showed that the budget we were given at the beginning of this session was extremely regressive. Low income people would be very adversely affected and single income couples with two children would be worse off than they were 10 years ago. There were certain other assumptions, such as that all pensioners and the unemployed would receive rent assistanceâ€”and on it went. Treasury had used a very flawed model and the analysis that flowed from it was very generous towards the budget. Nevertheless, it still showed that the budget was extremely regressive.

          Budget mark 2 was formulated at an impromptu meeting of caucus on Monday night. My question to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) yesterday was directed towards the outcome and modifications that we have been led to expect will happen; but, even after those changes, the poorer people would be worse off. For example, without taking account of bracket creep, the poorest 20 per cent of single-income families and the poorest 10 per cent of two-income families with children and most independent retiree couples would be worse off. The Treasurer in his answer referred to what was then a not released analysis of the budget, an analysis which he said was going to be released later that day. He made the statement:

         version. The words `full-time' were inserted in front of `wage and salary earners'. It is a fact of the recession we are now enduring that a substantial percentage of people in employment are underemployed. The unemployment figures do not show the effect of underemployment. So the insertion of the words `full-time' in that context is significant.

          He went on to talk about `self-employed and farm income household types'. None of these groups that he referred to are the groups that I had questioned him about. So it was the old business: when you are asked a question that you do not like, answer a different question. He raised, in his answer, categories of people different from the ones that I had questioned him about.

          Yesterday afternoon, after question time, the so-called Prismod results were released. They showed that certain things were excluded. This analysis, which at question time the Treasurer was saying showed what a whacko budget it was, contained certain omissions: the income tax broadening issues; increases in the effect of fringe benefits tax and the retrospective taxation of unused annual leave; and the effect of bracket creep. They had not been taken into account, because no projections had been made past 1994-95. The government claims credit for cuts after 1994-95, but it cuts out that area when the inflationary effects of this budget are yet to be felt.

         â€”I will resume. The exclusion of such basic issues as the effect of inflation, particularly on low income people, is very significant. The issue I raised in question time today was the assumption that all motorists will use the cheaper unleaded petrol as from the time that this budget is passed. The fact is that approximately 60 per cent of Australians drive cars that require leaded petrolâ€”which is to be significantly more expensive than unleaded petrol. The extra impact is on the very low income people, as the opposition has been saying, who are more likely to drive the older cars requiring the more expensive leaded petrol.

        (5) No. The sum depends on the level of administrative charges, returns on investment and net tax paid, all of which can vary considerably from fund to fund. Nevertheless, funds typically impose an administrative charge of around $1 per week per account to which must be added, in some cases, fund management fees (often of the order of 0.5 per cent of the value of the fund), premiums for death and disability cover, and entry and exit fees.

        (1) There is no commitment in the 1992-93 Budget to provide funding for a Republic Advisory Committee, but $55 000 was provided to the Committee in the Additional Estimates in May 1993. The 1993-94 Budget provides $551 000 for the Republic Advisory Committee, the secretariat services being provided to it by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and any further constitutional reform activity arising this financial year. The Committee's task will be finished when it reports at the end of September 1993. The 1993-94 Budget did contain a commitment to spend $200 000 in the out years for constitutional reform activity.
