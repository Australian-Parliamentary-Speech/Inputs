                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are moving this motion today for this parliament to debate the declaration of a climate emergency, because across the Tasman Aotearoa New Zealand are today declaring a climate emergency in their parliament under a Labor government with a strong Greens presence, including a Greens climate minister. I quote Christiana Figueres, who this morning said, 'There is no other country that has as much renewable potential as Australia,' and that the world is waiting for a 'suicidal Australia' to reverse its position on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our opportunity to recognise that we are in an urgent climate emergency. This is our opportunity to be united in the Pacific, in our part of the world. Pacific small island nations have recently written to Australia—just yesterday, as my colleague asked about in question time yesterday to a very unsatisfactory response—to remind us that their homelands and cultures face devastation from climate change and that we must not continue to have the weakest pollution targets in the developed world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Environmental collapse is unfolding right in front of our eyes and it's being driven by the profits of coal, oil and gas companies. Stopping a breakdown of the earth's delicate climate system is no longer about protecting future generations; it's happening now. Let's recap this year so far in Australia. This year started with megafires on a scale that we have never seen before. It was deep drought that made such devastating fires possible. Other parts of the country had hailstorms, toxic smoke covering cities and dust clouds swallowing up entire regional towns. We've just come out of an intense heatwave in springtime and now K'gari, or Fraser Island as it's known, is on fire, with a 1,000-year-old tree under threat and people being evacuated. The Bureau of Meteorology confirmed just yesterday that that we've had the hottest spring on record and the hottest November on record, and this is despite our first La Nina in nine years, which is supposed to keep temperatures lower than normal. The bureau has advised us that what we can expect in this La Nina summer are high flooding and the increased chance of cyclones. The last time a La Nina occurred was when the Brisbane River flooded in 2011, with much devastation caused to surrounding areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Global heating is now a direct and present threat to every aspect of the lives that we cherish and hold dear. We are in a climate emergency and we need to act quickly and forcefully, just as we have in other emergencies. The first responsibility of government is to keep its citizens safe from danger, but the government is pushing us further into trouble rather than keeping us safe. We cannot exceed two degrees of warming. But the Bureau of Meteorology has advised our parliament that the targets that this government has set for Australia have us on track for up to 4.4 degrees of warming in our children's lifetimes. We have 10 years to get this under control. The year 2050 means nothing if we don't halve pollution over this critical decade to 2030, and that's pure physics. As much as you like to think you can, you can't negotiate with physical sciences. Unless we rapidly change away from coal, oil and gas, life as we have always known it will cease to exist. Nothing will be left untouched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can have that future or we can have a future where, in the middle of a recession, which I note we are coming out of today, we are creating jobs directly by building abundant, clean, cheap, renewable energy to attract domestic manufacturing back onshore again. Our wind and our sun are our competitive advantage. High-speed rail, public transport networks, green steel, hydrogen, electric vehicle manufacturing—these are the areas where jobs can be created today. We can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country, rejuvenating landscapes, planting trees and restoring creek lines and rivers. We have all the technology, skills, capital and resources that we need to create this safe, abundant world, but we have to sideline the coal, oil and gas industries that have the major parties wrapped around their little tentacles.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will get there, but we don't have a lot of time. That is why the government and the whole of society must recognise that we are in an emergency and take action at emergency speed. Now is our chance to join New Zealand, England, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Canada and, the biggest customer of our coal and gas, Japan. If we don't, Australia will remain increasingly isolated on the global stage, with our only allies being petrostates like Russia, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. So, for Australia to hold its head up high, I commend this declaration to the Senate.</span>

The occasional allusion to the procedural matter would be helpful for debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to introduce the Electoral Amendment (Territory Representation) Bill 2020. This bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span> to provide greater certainty to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory regarding their representation in the House of Representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the 2019 federal election, the Northern Territory elected two members. However, on 3 July 2020, using population statistics supplied by the Australian Statistician, the Electoral Commissioner issued a determination under the Electoral Act regarding the number of members of the House of Representatives for the next federal election. This determination provides that the Northern Territory and Western Australia will each lose a seat in the House of Representatives, and Victoria will gain a seat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If left to stand, this determination would mean the Northern Territory, with an area of 1.3 million square kilometres and a population of nearly 250,000, would only hold one seat in the House of Representatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring fair and equitable parliamentary representation across the country, especially across such a large and diverse part of our nation as the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is proposing these amendments to the Electoral Act to preserve two members to represent the Northern Territory in the House at the next election and to make permanent changes to buttress the basis on which we calculate Territory representation for future elections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill responds to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, arising from an inquiry into a private senator's bill introduced to the Senate to guarantee two seats for the Northern Territory. I thank the Committee for its work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the private senator's bill examined by the Committee would have achieved an outcome of two seats for the Northern Territory at the next election, it did have some deficiencies and would have increased risk and complexity in the operation of the Electoral Act. The Committee also suggested that the private senator's bill could conceivably create issues of potential constitutional risk, by treating the two Territories differently – giving a two seat floor to the Northern Territory while keeping the Australian Capital Territory on the old floor of one seat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the Committee also found that the private senator's bill did not include all necessary legislative changes. For example that bill did not amend the numerous places in Part IV of the Electoral Act (dealing with boundary drawing for electorates), where the Northern Territory is currently omitted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Accordingly, the Committee recommended that an alternative bill be put forward by the Government, with the benefit of official advice, to address these problems and ensure a more robust solution. The Committee recommended that <span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">if Parliament does not enact a two seat floor for the Territories it considers […] enacting a harmonic mean for allocating seats between States and Territories</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Taking account of the Committee's views, the Government's Bill makes four main changes related to Territory representation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">It amends the Electoral Act to set aside part of the Electoral Commissioner's determination of 3 July 2020 which would have reduced the NT's representation in the House of Representatives for the next election from two seats to one seat, and restores the Northern Territory to a two seat entitlement for the next general election; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Bill adopts a new harmonic mean method for determining the allocation of House of Representative seats to the territories. Based on current population statistics, this would result in the NT continuing to be eligible for two seats when the next determination occurs ahead of the 2025 election and the ACT likewise retaining its current allocation of three seats;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Bill ensures that this harmonic mean method for allocating seats to Territories will lower the rounding mark to get from one to two seats, and from two to three seats. Where a Territory with a fast growing population is approaching four or more seats, it will revert to the same rounding rule as the States from that point;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Finally the Bill repeals the margin of error provisions for population calculations for the NT and the ACT, and also better aligns the redistribution provisions for the NT and the ACT to modernise and simplify the administration of the Electoral Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Application of a harmonic mean calculation will result in a more significantly more favourable rounding up of the quotas required to secure additional seats in the House of Representatives, as compared to the previous margin of error adjustment. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A territory with one House of Representative seat will only require a quota of 1.3333 to gain a second seat, and a territory with two seats will only require a quota of 2.4000 to be allocated a third seat. Based on their past population levels, both territories would comfortably pass those respective thresholds.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Harmonic mean rounding is recognised by electoral systems experts as the most fair and suitable approach for assigning parliamentary seats between different geographic areas, to fix the unduly heavy constituent workload that can arise in the smallest areas. Prominent commentator Antony Green has been the principal exponent for this reform in Australia. Consistent with his recommendations, the Bill removes the margin of error method as a trade-off for introduction of the more generous solution of harmonic mean rounding.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This not only allows the Northern Territory to hold its ground, ensuring strong representation for the remote and disadvantaged communities included in its borders, but makes it easier to achieve growth of its Parliamentary representation to three seats as it develops economically. </span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">After recent years of declining population, 2020 is the year it starts to turn around. We are growing again. … Residential building approvals were up 150 per cent in September – nearly 10 times the national average, and Darwin scored the strongest property price growth of any capital city last month. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on operations and global markets, our mining sector continues to perform strongly, with production and exploration at near-record levels. Though the Budget</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government Bill avoids taking risks with the constitutionality, because our amendments treat territories on the basis of objective principles and methods, rather than setting arbitrary numbers of seats for each specific territory. The worst thing we could do is to enact a solution, that would be at risk of being struck down in the courts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The methodology in the 2020 Government Bill is consistent with the constitutional characteristics of a representative democracy because, the new methodology is overtly designed to ensure that the average population per electorate in the NT is sufficiently commensurate with the national average population per electorate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments ensure continued parity in the Electoral Act provisions regarding the seats for the NT and the ACT. This is consistent with the approach to the previous 2004 amendments, to protect the Northern Territory's position, which also treated both territories alike.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The concern about constitutional risk has been identified by the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters every time they have considered Territory representation. The 2004 report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, as the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended, the Bill also better aligns the treatment of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in boundary redistribution provisions. Once a territory has multiple seats, we must ensure that the boundary drawing processes are working efficiently when there are disparate population fluctuations within different geographic parts of that territory. Our bill ensures that the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated the same as the States wherever possible in Part IV of the Electoral Act.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The one exception to symmetry between the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in the Government Bill relates to the consequential rules about participation of Australian Electoral Officers in redistribution processes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this bill, the Northern Territory Australian Electoral Officer will participate in NT redistribution processes, just as their State counterparts would participate when House of Representatives boundaries are redrawn within particular States. However the Australian Electoral Officer for the Australian Capital Territory is only appointed for the duration of an election, so during any redistributions in the ACT another senior officer from the Electoral Commission will participate in the process, as determined by the Electoral Commissioner. That distinctive treatment for the Australian Capital Territory is an existing feature of the Act, that is cost effective and not necessary to disturb in this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I note there has been recent conjecture in Parliamentary Committee hearings about the future status of the Australian Electoral Officer for the Northern Territory. I take this opportunity to put those concerns to rest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill recognises that the Australian Electoral Officer in the Northern Territory is <span style="font-style:italic;">always</span> to be a member of the Redistribution Committee for any redistributions in that territory. I also note, for the record, that the process to permanently re-fill the Australian Electoral Officer position for the Northern Territory will begin before the end of 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, I observe that following passage of major electoral Bills in recent times, it has become an established practice to have a Post Implementation Review within a reasonable period after provisions have come into operation. That is a prudent practice. Accordingly this Bill includes a requirement that the harmonic mean provisions are reviewed by a parliamentary committee as soon as practicable after the first occasion when the provisions are used for a determination. That would occur during the life of the next Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In conclusion, it is important that we remain committed to improving electoral legislation in a non-partisan manner which promotes public confidence, within the constraints of our constitutional system and the requirements of representative democracy. Respecting those principles, we have been able to draft a solution that errs towards ensuring the strongest representation for Australia's territories.</span>

You'll, of course, be aware that often decisions are published in respect of the AAT and the courts so that people in the community can understand what the rules are, how the law works and the operation of the bill in this instance. If there are never any reasons made available for people to look at to understand why something was rejected, how is it that the government will inform the public and entities that are subject to this bill of, basically, the mood of the government and how to avoid getting into a situation where an agreement is entered into that ultimately gets overturned or where they start to walk down a path for an agreement which then later has the minister intervening? </span>

Obviously, in relation to the processes which will exist under the bill, the engagement of the task force with entities, state and territory governments, local governments and universities will be very much part of that process. As I alluded to yesterday—and I haven't quite put my hand on the note that I was using yesterday—it's similar to the provisions under the FIRB, which are also sensitive decisions and are provisions which have a similar application as these. We will be engaging comprehensively with those stakeholders, with those entities, on these matters. I think once the stocktake process is underway, and we have the chance to go through the arrangements and work with entities about the nature of those arrangements, I do think this will fall into a sort of rhythm, if you like, in terms of awareness and understanding of what the implications are in relation to foreign policy and foreign relations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing I would like to absolutely assure the chamber of is that this is in no way intended to be a confrontational engagement or a confrontational relationship between the Commonwealth government and state and territory and local governments and universities under this bill. This is meant to be and will be, I'm absolutely confident, a constructive set of relationships that will assist us all in coming to a collaborative approach on foreign policy and reflecting the Commonwealth's particular role in that regard.</span>

In relation to a decision that related to a state government—and I asked this question in ignorance of how Commonwealth-state relations work at a ministerial level—does the dialogue between states and the Commonwealth permit the disclosure of those perhaps sensitive reasons to the states so that they are assisted as they may seek to establish future agreements with overseas entities?</span>

The delegations are limited to the secretary of the department or a person who holds or performs the duties of an SES in the department, but the minister is not able to delegate any of the minister's powers or functions under the parts of the bill which deal with negotiating and entering core foreign relations; or, in relation to part 4, a core foreign arrangement; or section 54, which is part of the legislation which deals with making the rules. A delegate, in exercising any powers or performing any functions under the delegations, must comply with any directions of the minister. That's section 56 of the legislation, which is very clear about the delegations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:58</span>):  I rise to put on the public record my concerns about not only the substance of this but this minister's failure to engage with us constructively. We are of the view that it's a pretty reasonable proposition when a minister is exercising this level of power—and it is a substantial power. Let's recall that this could enable whoever is there, perhaps this minister or possibly Peter Dutton—goodness me, imagine the power in his hands!—to just choose to exercise the power to stop Premier McGowan's agreements with some international entity. Obviously the BRI is in their sights—the Victorian one. There are some agreements Steven Marshall has with sister city arrangements. Whoever is in that seat, whether it's Marise Payne or Peter Dutton, could do so without giving the government notice and could make a decision without even writing down the reason for it. That's the kind of authoritarian power she's defending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I know Senator Payne doesn't like to pick up the phone, but there's an incredible amount of passivity associated with dealing with this legislation. Every day of consultation by this minister, which had been non-existent, was after the bill had been announced. I mean, really: that's not consultation. I think there's some suggestion that it's a privileged position to actually talk to people, but I just think it's good legislating. If you're going to introduce a power that gives you the discretion to veto agreements across subnational entities and universities, what's the problem with actually talking to people in order to work through how that might best work? That's called good government. But no, she didn't pick up the phone and didn't meet with them. We saw that on Qatar, too. Even with the engagement on foreign policy and the exchange with Senator Rice, I think it was, about why foreign policy isn't defined—and I actually understand the argument there—the minister's department has admitted that engagement with the affected entities on government foreign policy is ad hoc.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I indicated broad support for this legislation on the day it was announced, subject to constitutional remit and subject to looking at the detail. We hear from the minister's office and we want to be bipartisan. We send them our amendments—radio silence; not even the courtesy of a call. On this legislation, at this time, I would have thought they'd want some bipartisanship. During this time that we're going through—we saw what happened yesterday and the day before; we understand what Australia is dealing with—why not try to land an agreement? But no: just silence, and she just comes down here and airily dismisses it. Frankly, I think it's pretty poor form, and I'm putting that on the public record. It's deeply disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing the minister has said on these issues around the accountability of the executive for this decision makes sense. Her arguments to Senator Patrick yesterday and today really don't hold up. I again put on record our willingness to consider an alternative proposition to deal with some of the issues the minister has raised, even though I believe that those issues are dealt with in the amendments we've proposed. But, again: radio silence. I can't work out whether it's just passivity or, frankly, arrogance—because I do think it's a pretty arrogant position to say the federal government is not accountable for the decisions it makes. So, I hope the Western Australians will have a think—whichever minister is there, whether it be Peter Dutton or someone like that—about which of Mark McGowan's propositions might be vetoed without reasonable notice.</span>

I was going to move to other topics, but perhaps the Greens or Senator Patrick have further issues before I do so.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I want to conclude some of this discussion about the concerns we have about the lack of a collaborative approach and the lack of accountability. Minister, you've talked about how this isn't meant to be adversarial, that it's collaborative—that it's about people working together. But that hasn't been the experience so far in terms of consultation and working with a whole range of stakeholders before this legislation was introduced. I want to put on the record that Australia's interests are, obviously, incredibly important and the issue of foreign interference is incredibly important. I think everybody around this chamber recognises the measures to ensure that there isn't foreign interference—that is, that we are not entering into relationships that are not in our interests or not in the interests of human rights or not in the interests of good order in the world. It's important that we do have legislation that enables us to deal with those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also agree with the premise of the legislation. I think that it's important that there is a collaborative and cooperative approach between the states and the Commonwealth in terms of our international relations. A situation like the Victorian government deciding that it was going to go and enter into the Belt and Road Initiative with China without engaging the Commonwealth is not a situation that is in the good interests of Australia. That's playing off different parts of the Commonwealth and different states against each other. That collaborative approach is clearly essential, but we can see that that collaborative approach, and that reporting back and accountability, which goes hand in hand with that collaborative approach—is not baked into this bill. Minister, you talk about the fact that they can happen but that doesn't mean that they will happen. Unless you actually have them there in the legislation to ensure they will happen, it is very possible that—maybe not under you as minister, Minister Payne, but under future ministers—these things won't happen. The powers that are vested in the foreign minister to take a complete over-the-top, non-collaborative approach are there in the bill. They are there. They are enabled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the collaborative approach, we know there was no consultation with the states and territories before this legislation was introduced. What discussions have been had with all of the states and territories since the introduction of the bill? We know that not all of the states and territories took the opportunity to put in submissions to the inquiry and those that did were largely not supportive of the bill. Minister, could you please go through the negotiations and the discussions that you have had with all of the states and territories since the legislation was introduced?</span>

Let me say that in this place there are a range of ways in which legislation is brought to the parliament in either chamber—a range of ways. Government selects, according to the nature of the legislation and the approach government wants to take, how they do that. In some cases there will be large public exposure draft processes and in some cases there will not, but that is a matter which is for government. The approach that the government has taken in this context is obviously the one that is before us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the introduction of the bill, as I indicated in the chamber yesterday, there were, I think, 60 consultations through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Prior to the committee hearings, I understand that the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate was briefed on the bill as part of that process. I would have to say to the chamber that I think this government is actually very constructive with briefing engagement with the opposition in a way, in fact, that I did not experience in my time as a shadow minister in this place—not even close. I do think we try to be constructive and, indeed, very forthcoming with briefings as they are requested by senators, including yourself. If I may say, Senator Rice, in the brief time since you've held this portfolio briefings have been offered by government to the opposition in relation to key matters in my portfolio.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You asked for an indication of stakeholder engagement in the discussion of the legislation, Senator. In conferring with officials, I can advise you that consultations and discussions have taken place, largely by video conference, in the context of COVID-19, as follows in no particular order: with the South Australian Department of the Premier and Cabinet on 27 August, with the Tasmanian Department of Premier and Cabinet and Department of State Growth on 27 August, and with the New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet and Treasury on 28 August. There have been consultations and discussions on 31 August with the Queensland Department of the Premier and Cabinet and with Trade and Investment Queensland; on 2 September with WA's Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation; on 2 September with Global Victoria; on 10 September with the Northern Territory Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade and Department of the Chief Minister and Cabinet; on 14 September with the Queensland Department of the Premier and Cabinet; and on 17 September with the Western Australian Department of the Premier and Cabinet and with WA Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation for a second time.</span>

On 12 October we met with the Senior Officials Trade and Investment Group, which I understand to be a group of officials from the ACT, Queensland, New South Wales, Northern Territory, South Australian and Victorian governments who are senior office holders in their portfolio area of trade and investment. On 5 November we met again with the New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet.</span>

Also on 16 September we met again with the Group of Eight. That included the Group of Eight executive and representatives of the University of Adelaide, the University of Melbourne, Monash University, the Australian National University, the University of Queensland, the University of Western Australia, the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney. On 17 September we met with the Innovative Research Universities group. That included the executive of the Innovative Research Universities group plus Griffith University, James Cook University, Western Sydney University, Charles Darwin University, La Trobe University, Murdoch University and Flinders University. On 25 September we met again with the executive of the Australian Technology Network of Universities and, secondly—also on 25 September—we met again with the ATN executive and the University of Technology Sydney, the RMIT University, the University of South Australia and Curtin University.</span>

That meeting included the UFIT, RMIT University, the University of Newcastle, the University of Queensland, La Trobe University and the Australian National University. On 30 September we met again with Universities Australia. That meeting included the executive of UA and also the University of Queensland. On 1 October we met with the Innovative Research Universities group again. The group on that occasion—I'm just trying to see if there is a difference between the universities that were included on that occasion and the 17 September group, but I don't think that there is—was the same group that met on 17 September.</span>

On 16 September, the DFAT peak business body group was also engaged in consultation on this matter. That included AusIMM, the Australia China Business Council, the Ai Group, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the Australian Services Roundtable, the Business Council of Australia, Citi Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Minerals Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Export Council of Australia, the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance, the Australian Food and Grocery Council, and Austmine.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those consultations obviously have been broad and far ranging in terms of the issues on which DFAT has engaged. They have included: the draft rules, which, as you know, have been loaded onto DFAT's website; the information that is to be included in notices; the nature and form of the public register and what that will include; and exemption arrangements as part of those discussions.</span>

I just want to make the observation that we have been debating this bill since Monday night. We are still in the committee stage, but we are yet to consider a single amendment. There have been a number of questions asked by senators on the same topic over and over again. It appears, to me, that it might be that the chamber is trying to delay the passage of this bill, which I think would be very unfortunate given the bipartisan support for this bill and particularly considering the events of this week. I hope the Senate can quickly move on to the substantive matters and the amendments that senators wish to move.</span>

There are a lot of very important questions to be asked about this legislation. What I wanted to ask, finally, on those consultations, Minister, is this. You said documentation of those consultations isn't on the public record. I ask if you could please take on notice to provide the documentation of those consultations for us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have one further question in terms of those consultations. In terms of the rules and guidelines that have been laid out, I'm interested to know what discussions there have been with the states and territories or local governments about the arrangements with particular countries where the understanding will be that, yes, those arrangements will certainly need to be particularly scrutinised. Or is there a group of arrangements with particular countries that are ruled out, essentially because there is no worry, and so there isn't going to be considerable scrutiny of those countries. If so, has there been an articulation of which countries fall within those two buckets?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to countries, let me be very clear: this bill is not directed at any single country, or any single arrangement for that matter. As I said yesterday, and as I said publicly when the bill was announced by the Prime Minister some time ago now, an open-source review of state and territory arrangements with foreign countries provided a tally of over 130 different arrangements with more than 30 countries which literally spanned the globe, and the alphabet actually, in terms of their breadth. There will be many countries which have been discussed in consultations with officials. But until the stocktake process is underway and is in motion, as it were, as part of the implementation of the bill, should it pass, it's difficult to identify if there's a specific sort of arrangement, or a specific issue, or a specific country which will come to the fore in this. Most importantly, though, to bring it back to the principles behind the bill in relation to foreign policy and foreign relations: we come back to that position where the Commonwealth is the part-lead voice on these matters. Australia's approach is a consistent and joined-up one, and I do think that that is a very important purpose of the bill.</span>

I want to pursue the issue of the documentation of the records of the consultations. There must be some documentation that you can share with the Senate that is de-identified and doesn't risk the privilege and the privacy of the stakeholder. There must be an overall summary of the documentation of the consultations that you are able to share with us relating to the issues that were raised in various consultations, and which summarises those issues and concerns.</span>

Can the minister confirm that there has been no conversation that she has engaged in with any of the heads of government or first ministers across Australia who are affected by this? Not Premier Berejiklian, not Premier Marshall, not Premier Gutwein, not Premier McGowan, not the chief ministers. She's not had any conversation with any level of government about this?</span>

That was an ongoing process up until the announcement and tabling of the legislation in the House of Representatives. That drafting process is something that, as you well know, is a very consultative process between agencies, parliamentary council and ministers, and the bill in its final form is as it stands.</span>

I just think it's not a bad thing, when they're involved in the foreign interference task force process, to actually let them know. You might get a better outcome. Anyway, let's just be really clear: the minister and her department have been asked this regularly, including at Senate estimates, and they refuse to answer, which can only lead to one conclusion—they were a last-minute inclusion in the bill.</span>

Actually, I do: you don't want to tell us because it was a late edition. Can the minister explain the regulatory gap between public and private universities? Why aren't private universities subject to the same requirements?</span>

I just want to grab the reference, if I may. Obviously, Australian public universities are covered because they are state and territory entities established by law with significant levels of international engagement. While the Australian National University is established by Commonwealth law, it has been included to ensure parity between public universities. Given that the bill is intended to address foreign engagement by state and territory governments and government entities, it's not intended to regulate private entities, such as private universities, which have no connection to government. Accordingly, the way the bill is presented reflects our focus on ensuring consistency in Australian foreign policy and foreign relations across all levels of Australian government.</span>

It's quite possible for private universities to engage in agreements which are not consistent with Australia's foreign policy. You shake your head, but I would have thought that would be pretty self-evident. Why does Bond University get to do whatever it likes while the ANU has to be subject to this regime? If we're consistent about Australia having a coherent approach to foreign policy, why would you exclude privates?</span>

I'm making a policy point.' If we're serious that the federal government should have—and I agree with this proposition; I think it's unremarkable—the primary responsibility for Australia's foreign policy and external relations, surely, as a matter of policy, you would include private universities? On this, we've had a whole range of evidence put before the Senate committee, in the public arena and through the intelligence committee inquiry about the actions of universities. Is there a constitutional reason why private universities are not included, or is it just the privileging of Bond University and others?</span>

It's not about privileging any private university entity. This is about public entities. It's about public universities being covered because they are state and territory entities established by law, because the ANU is a Commonwealth university established under Commonwealth law and therefore also a public university. Given that the bill is about addressing foreign engagement by state and territory governments and government entities and that private universities are not government entities, they are not within the scope of the bill.</span>

This is a bill that goes to the local shire council. The bill includes your capacity to strike down agreements of much smaller entities than a private university. Is the minister really saying that there's no possibility that an entity such as Bond or another private university could enter into an agreement which was inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy?</span>

They are established by law as state and territory entities. While, obviously, the ANU is established by the Commonwealth law, it falls within the scope of this bill because it is also a public university. The whole point of the legislation is about addressing foreign engagement by state and territory governments and government entities. Entities which are not government entities are not within the scope of the bill.</span>

If we think about some local shire council in the Australian democracy, you could strike an agreement of theirs down but you think it's not relevant for a significant university to come within the remit of the bill. You can answer on process but there's a policy point: there's a regulatory gap which you've put in place and which you haven't justified other than in a sort of process-process answer.</span>

Other universities will be required to comply. My recollection is—and I'm sure the minister will correct me if I'm wrong—that all universities, including private universities, are part of the foreign interference task force process. Why was that decision made to exclude private universities from the remit of this bill? That's a policy question. Secondly, you haven't come back to me on this: can you just confirm that there is no constitutional reason that private universities should be excluded?</span>

It was stated to me that it is to do with the states and territories, and I understand that. My suggestion, then, to the advisers would be: why shouldn't we write to the private universities and ask them to be part of it on a voluntary basis? I think that was going to be put to the department. Is it a consideration that, because it could be unconstitutional to include them in it, possibly it could be a matter of writing to the private universities to ask them to be a part of it voluntarily?</span>

I understand those conversations have been had. That is in part the purpose of doing the three-year review and why we made that amendment. As I said to Senator Wong—I'm not sure if you'd come into the chamber at that point—there are many avenues for engagement of private universities on these important and sensitive issues. We encourage them to engage. But, in terms of the issue you have raised, that is certainly something that can be considered in that way.</span>

Senator Wong has an amendment to the bill that would require a report from the government to be laid on the table. I'm a bit mystified as to why you would put up an amendment to the bill regarding a report to be laid on the table with regard to the bill, when this could have been done through a notice of motion. I am terribly concerned about the way the port of Darwin was leased. My question for the government is: can the leasing of the port of Darwin be reversed, under this bill or any other legislation by the government, so that the port ends up back in the hands of the Australian people, not foreign owned?</span>

That is a change since that transaction was made. That provision of the Foreign Investment Review Board goes to precisely the point that you make.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, in 2018, introduced the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act, which strengthens the ability of the government to monitor and protect against risks to critical infrastructure such as water, electricity, gas, and port assets specifically—in relation to this question. That means we now have a critical infrastructure asset register to ensure that government knows who owns and operates our most critical assets. It also provided a ministerial directions power of last resort, which provides the Minister for Home Affairs with the power to issue a direction to an owner or operator of a critical infrastructure asset to mitigate national security risks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June of this year we announced reforms to further strengthen our foreign investment framework, and those changes will include a new national security test to ensure the government can address national security concerns arising from new individual investment proposals which would otherwise be below the screening thresholds. Subject to the passage of legislation, those reforms commence on 1 January next year. In terms of the commercial agreement between the Northern Territory government and the commercial operator of the lease of the Port of Darwin, the Commonwealth is not in a position to reverse that agreement. But since 2016, through all of those steps, we have put in place protections and provisions which ensure that, should such a transaction come to the point of being made again, all of those steps that I have just gone through are now in place to address that and the concerns you have raised.</span>

Can you guarantee the Australian people that, even under that scheme, everything China wants to buy up in Australia will come under the national interest test so they can't just come in and buy it up without it going through FIRB, without it being fully investigated and without it being in the best interests of Australia?</span>

I would first make the point that the reason we have done it as an amendment rather than a motion is that the government can ignore a motion but it can't ignore a piece of law. That is the logic of it. You have raised that with me, and I think that is a consistent position. Why don't we do it as a notice of motion? The reality is that the minister can just ignore a notice of motion whereas you can't ignore the law—one hopes! Secondly, I don't recall the minister ever having said before what she is now saying, which is that the government is not in a position to reverse the lease on the Port of Darwin.</span>

                    </a>  I'm sure that was the advice. No, I'm not pushing back on it. Everyone has hedged it when we have asked it; everyone else has ducked that question. I would like to understand why. This legislation is in effect retrospective—that is, you can veto, under this legislation, deals which were previously made. I think that's pretty clear. Obviously, the Port of Darwin is such a deal. It may be that because the Port of Darwin arrangement is with an ostensibly private entity it is outside of the bill. If that's the case, I would like to understand that. These are the issues that we traversed in the Senate committee. I don't think they were clarified. It would be useful to clarify it here.</span>

Arrangements of that nature may only be within the scheme's scope if they are subsidiary to a core or non-core arrangement between the state or territory government and a foreign government or a foreign government entity. That's irrespective of whether the corporation is wholly or partly state owned or privately owned. Arrangements by state or territory locally owned corporations such as water corporations or port authorities are not the focus of the legislation. My understanding is that those sorts of transactions, those sorts of commercial arrangements, are best situated within the context of FIRB arrangements rather than this bill. </span>

That's the first point. Second point: the port of Darwin would not be within the remit of the legislation, because your advice is that it is with a private entity. Third point: given the arrangements within China around the role of government and its engagement in the economy, does that change your view about whether or not the government could consider this lease to this private entity? Is that clear? It doesn't have a market economy. I know the Howard government said it did have a market economy. Obviously, the government has a much greater interest in, and capacity to influence, the behaviour of otherwise private companies than it does in Australia. Given that, does that change the government's view about its jurisdictional relation to the port of Darwin?</span>

The advice that officials have provided is that that still falls within the parameters of the statement I made earlier about commercial arrangements. They would only be within the scheme's scope if they were subsidiary to a core or non-core arrangement under the legislation, and that's irrespective of whether the corporation is—to your point about control—wholly or partly state owned or privately owned. So arrangements by state, territory or locally owned corporations are not the focus of the legislation.</span>

That's my first question, about the arrangements. Whilst I understand your argument that, with bipartisan support, you've done what we suggested, which was a different approach on FIRB and critical infrastructure et cetera, there is no capacity for government to regulate leases that have already been signed under those arrangements going forward. Does the minister have any concerns about any foreign policy implications or national security implications of those existing arrangements?</span>

I don't have every one of those at my fingertips in terms of who is the owner or lessee in that context, so I can't comment directly on those. Therefore I am speaking in the broad, and I should reinforce that. The nature of the commercial arrangements is also not known to me. Obviously it is case by case. But I was trying to respond to the specific questions in relation to the port of Darwin. My understanding is that the critical infrastructure legislation plus the FIRB, which has clear rules on state owned enterprise investments, are the relevant framework under which these are dealt with. We do not want to duplicate those powers, and these other frameworks cover private company and commercial concerns.</span>

But, in the future, if a state government engaged in an arrangement with a foreign entity—sorry: I've forgotten what the term is under the bill—which contemplated leasing arrangements, for example, then the leases would come within the remit of the minister for the purposes of the bill and could be vetoed at that point?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just so everyone understands, what these amendments seek to do is to bring within the scope of the bill both the Australian Olympic Committee and foreign Olympic committees—so that could be some foreign Olympic body or, indeed, the International Olympic Committee. I'm going to start off by telling you my motivation for this. All laws are generally designed to deal with controversy, so I just want to give you an example of the controversy that caused me to propose this amendment. It relates to the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. These winter games will occur in Beijing, and there is no question that the Olympics are the international event. They are used by governments of all types to promote national pride. They're used as a propaganda tool. We here in Australia used the Sydney Olympics as a promotional tool for Australia. In the case of the Beijing Olympics, unfortunately, those Olympics will be run in the shadow of a range of human rights abuses. I will name just a few of those. For example, of course, we have the Uighurs in western China who are being subjected to genocide, to use the words of Mr Joe Biden. We've got the crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong—and, indeed, right across China. That's another issue that must be of concern to all Australians. We've had the arbitrary detention of foreigners in China, and, indeed, we know that just recently some Australian journalists were harassed, I might say, prior to leaving China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot stand by and simply observe what is happening and then basically allow the Chinese government to promote their nation to try to improve their national standing by using something like the Olympics. I know some people would say that sports and politics should never be mixed, but the reality is that they are inextricably linked and there is no question that they are. That is seen in the way in which countries promote their nations or their cities in the competitions that lead up to the selection processes and the fact that all of the athletes who attend the Beijing Olympics will have come from places like the Australian Institute of Sport or other organisations that are funded by taxpayers. Mr John Coates wrote to the committee that examined these bills and basically said that we've got to keep politics out of the Olympics. In some sense that's a farcical statement, because, whilst Mr John Coates is the chair of the Australian Olympic Committee, you'll see that the Chinese Olympic committee is stacked with CCP members—indeed, the head of their committee is, in fact, the Chinese minister for sport. To try to suggest that the Olympic arrangements are pure and divorced from any politics is just ridiculous. It is a huge business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people may have a different opinion. They might say, 'I think you're wrong, Rex, and we should attend the Beijing 2022 Olympics.' I want to make it very clear that my amendments do not invoke a boycott of the Beijing 2022 Olympics. My amendments bring together those bodies within the scope of the bill so that the government, should it wish to, can initiate a boycott. It simply puts a card into the minister's back pocket for when we get to the point where others recognise what is happening in China. The British Foreign Secretary has raised concerns about participation in the Olympics, and I think that movement will grow stronger and stronger as we approach the Beijing 2022 Olympics. It would be good if the minister were able to exercise a power at government level to have Australia boycott the games. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not want to leave the decision on boycotting the Beijing 2022 Olympics to the athletes. That puts incredible pressure on those athletes, and that's not an acceptable outcome. We saw that taking place with the Moscow Olympics back in 1936, and we want to make sure that if a decision is made that it's not appropriate to attend the Beijing Olympics—and that's my strong view, because it's not appropriate to feed the Chinese propaganda machine—then that decision can be made by government. That could potentially invoke a range of different measures to compensate athletes, who devote their lives to preparing to attend these sorts of things. I want to be very clear that these amendments do not invoke a boycott; they simply give government an option to call for a boycott.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I didn't make a contribution to the second reading debate, I might just say that I do support the bills. I support the intent of the bills, but I do have some concerns in relation to granting an executive power without an appropriately balanced judicial review of decisions. In that sense, I may well support some of the amendments and I'll deal with those as they pop up. But, in principle, these bills should, at the final instance, be supported.</span>

These issues have been discussed recently within the parliament and more broadly. I understand why they are of significant and sincere concern. But, in terms of the bill, they do go beyond the scope and the intention of the bill. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, this is about regulating state and territory arrangements with foreign governments and related entities and there is not a direct line of government relationship between the Australian Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee and state and territory governments and foreign entities. As non-government organisations, they're not regulated by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also say that the Olympic Charter, which so far has broadly stood the test of time, provides that organisations within the Olympic movement shall apply political neutrality. I do think it's important to respect that political neutrality. In Australia the mechanism that goes to participation in the Olympic Games rests with the Australian Olympic Committee. They're responsible for funding and selecting the Australian team and sending them to the Olympic Games no matter where they are held.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a range of avenues available to us to advocate on human rights questions. I think a fair-minded observer would say that this government has advocated on those issues with conviction and commitment in multiple fora international and domestically and directly with China. We have participated and supported, from time to time, resolution statements in relation to precisely the issues that you have raised as matters of concern in your remarks today and previously in public statements. We continue to do so because advocacy on human rights is an important role for Australia and is something we took very, very seriously during our term as a member of the Human Rights Council. Whether it is in the UN General Assembly or in the Human Rights Council or other appropriate fora, that is the approach we have taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of attendance at international sporting events such as the Olympic Games, when I was briefly in Japan in October I was particularly struck by the extraordinary engagement of the entire nation—as we saw in Australia 20 years ago—in the prospective holding of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The Olympic Games are a very, very big deal for any country that is a host. We work closely with community organisations and with non-government organisations—they include sporting organisations. When there are concerns, from a foreign policy or security perspective, with Australian sporting teams attending international events, that is always something government can take up with the relevant sporting organisation. I recall that many years ago, in 2007, the then Prime Minister Howard and one of my distinguished predecessors—a fine South Australian—the then foreign minister Alexander Downer directed the cancellation of the Australian cricket team's tour of Zimbabwe. I'm sure you recall that too. So governments can and will engage on such matters, where it is necessary, to protect Australia's interests. That is really the point to come to, Senator Patrick, because I do understand what you seek to have government do and what you seek to have government have the capacity to do. I don't agree that the specific amendment is necessary for this to occur and, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, it goes beyond the confines of the bill, in terms of its application to state and territory government arrangements with foreign governments and related entities.</span>

I want to ask a question in relation to that response. I have a genuine concern that there is momentum building up to a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics, but I'll ask this question in a geographically neutral manner. In the event that there is an Olympic event where the pressure has built up to a point where athletes are being asked to make a decision for themselves about boycotting—that's the dilemma I'm trying to solve here. You mentioned Zimbabwe. What are the mechanisms for government to protect those athletes in circumstances where the pressure has built and the government is in agreement? What are the mechanisms to protect those athletes from having to make that decision themselves rather than having a decision made by the government on their behalf?</span>

Mechanisms per se—legislated, constructed—are not envisaged. And to be clear: at this point in time we're not considering a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. You make a relevant point about pressure and the demands that are placed on athletes, Senator Patrick. But government, as I said, works very closely with sporting organisations, peak bodies particularly, non-government organisations and community organisations in relation to these issues. I do remember that decision of the Howard government. I am in some circles known as a cricket tragic; it was a matter which I was following strongly at the time and which I strongly supported. I wrote to, I think, at least one cricketer at the time, who had taken it upon himself to take a particular personal stand. We're now friends—weird world. But there's not a structured mechanism, and I don't think that it's appropriate for that to be inserted in the context of this bill, for the reasons that I have said. But I can absolutely assure you, Senator Patrick, of how seriously government takes this, and that we can and will engage on those matters where it's necessary to protect Australia's interests.</span>

We deeply share his concerns about human rights abuses in China. We are deeply and passionately worried about the plight of the Uighurs in China, and the plight of the Tibetans over many years, and any people working for democracy in China; in fact, anybody within mainland China who dissents from the positions of the Chinese Communist Party, and the appalling attacks on them, the jailing and the torture. We are deeply concerned about the current situation in Hong Kong: the massive attacks on democracy in Hong Kong, the complete trashing of the 'one country, two systems' agreement, and, essentially, China just coming in with its might in Hong Kong. The question is what you do about it.</span>

We know, with the situation we're currently at with China, that it's a very difficult and sensitive situation as to how you can apply meaningful pressure on China to get some meaningful action on the human rights abuses that are going on, without everything just escalating out of control. These are incredibly serious issues that the world needs to be grappling with, not just allowing Chinese expansionism and not just allowing the ongoing abuse of human rights in China.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, the question, as I said, is how you go about it. We do not think that this legislation, including this sort of mechanism in this legislation, is the appropriate way to go about it. In fact, our position on this legislation is that we think it is too far-reaching and there is far too much control, without the appropriate checks and balances, over universities. We've got an amendment, as you know, to remove universities from the scheme. We think that the level of control and the ability to negate agreements made by local governments is overreach. So we don't think this legislation would be an appropriate mechanism to include that ability of control over the Olympic Committee.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, I think the calls, as Senator Patrick said, for a boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics are growing, and they are going to continue to grow because of the human rights situation in China. We really need to have the conversation about what we think of that call, because we know that the Beijing Winter Olympics are going to be a massive propaganda moment for the Chinese Communist Party. They are going to milk that for all they can, saying, 'No, we are a legitimate world player, a superpower on the world stage,' and trying to brush away what is going on, whether it's the Uighurs, the Tibetans or what is happening in Hong Kong. That is something the world is really going to need to grapple with and take a multilateral approach on. I can see over the coming two years that there will be countries that will decide their athletes should not go, and that will be supported by their countries. I also think it's incredibly important that, if there is a decision for Australia to boycott the Winter Olympics, it should be a decision that is supported by government. It cannot be left to the athletes to bear that decision themselves. I also reject the position that the Olympics Committee currently have that you need to separate sport from politics. That's never happened; and it never will. At this moment, the Winter Olympics are a political moment, and they are a critical moment for China on the world stage.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, we have got a very serious issue when it comes to human rights in China. It's a very serious issue, and the world needs to be dealing with it more appropriately than it is at the moment. But including the ability to deal with that within this legislation is not something the Greens support.</span>

I'll just indicate the opposition's position, which I've indicated to Senator Patrick. The amendment seeks to bring the Olympic movement within the operation of the bill and seeks to deal with arrangements between the AOC and foreign entities, including foreign Olympic bodies, which include the IOC—the International Olympic Committee—and other national Olympic committees in countries other than Australia. Each of these, obviously, is a foreign entity. I do recognise the concerns that Senator Patrick has held about the Olympic Winter Games that sit behind the amendment are longstanding. The advice I've received from the Australian Olympic Committee is that subjecting it to this legislation would violate its autonomy under the Olympic Charter. So, for that reason and others, the opposition is not minded to support Senator Patrick's amendment.</span>

Senator Patrick, I note, has circulated some amendments. Obviously I don't think they're as good as mine, but they are quite sensible amendments which go to the provision of reasons. I made the point earlier that these are pretty wideranging powers for a minister. A minister can veto an arrangement that Premier Berejiklian, the Sutherland Shire Council, Ipswich City Council or any of the above engages in with a foreign entity. We understand why that is necessary, but I repeat what I said yesterday, which is that I think if ministers do stuff they probably should explain to people what they're doing. My concern is the extent of the power that is vested in a minister by the parliament as a consequence of this is substantial and wideranging. It isn't enough of an answer on that extent of power to simply say, 'Foreign policy is the remit of the federal government.' Yes, it is, but a suggestion doesn't proceed from that that you can simply veto arrangements without providing any reasons or having any accountability.</span>

This is obviously a matter which we discussed yesterday and have again today. It is a matter which was considered seriously in the drafting of the legislation. The government is of the view, similarly to the way the FIRB legislation is constructed, that to prevent the potential for damage to bilateral relations, to protect Australia's position, including in bilateral and international forums or negotiations, it is appropriate for such serious decisions, as they are taken in the context of the FIRB as well, for reasons not to be publicly provided. However, I do think that the implementation of the bill, the provisions within the bill and the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade task force will go a great distance in our engagement with states and territories, local governments and universities in informing them and enabling them to work on these issues with a much better foundation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a secret process. The minister's decisions are made public through the register. They are open for all to see and to scrutinise. The minister is required in section 51 to take a significant set of matters into account in relation to the state or territory that might be making the arrangement. They include the importance of the arrangement in assisting or enhancing the state or territory's functioning and the extent of the performance of the arrangement—so its implementation. They include whether the declaration would impair the continued existence of the state or territory as an independent entity.</span>

                    </a>  Senator, they include whether the declaration would significantly curtail or interfere with the capacity of the state or territory to function as a government; whether the declaration would have significant financial consequences; whether it would impede the acquisition of goods or services by the state or territory, including, as some have raised, for the purposes of infrastructure; and whether it would have an effect on the capacity of the state or territory to complete an existing project that is to be delivered under the arrangement. </span>

In doing so, we have developed and put into the legislation presented to the parliament as part of section 51(2) those particular conditions. These are going to be decisions which are made robustly, made in the public interest, and made with transparency and accountability, as is appropriate given the nature of the issues concerned.</span>

That is not required under the legislation. But the process of the stocktake of arrangements which we will be undertaking with the states and territories and local government and relevant entities is part of developing, if you like—I think I used the word 'rhythm' previously in a discussion with Senator Rice or Senator Patrick—that relationship and the understanding of the nature of arrangements which might be within the purview of the bill, and the act if it is passed. And state and territory governments will be a key part of ensuring that that comes together. That goes to the point of the consultation, again, Senator. It's why we engage with jobs, tourism, science and innovation groups, and with the trade and investment group particularly, because these are issues of interest to them, and they've been productive discussions.</span>

When another level of government in Australia enters into an agreement—leaving aside whether it's good or bad—before you as the minister make a decision to override an elected government about whatever agreement they get into, whether it's with Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, whatever, why do you think it's appropriate the foreign minister doesn't even have to tell them she or he is considering it?</span>

It is open to the states and territories to seek further information, to seek to vary an arrangement to ensure that it is consistent. As I've said in answer to other questions, I think the stocktake process is a very important part of this in ensuring that it provides a level of awareness and information that will give familiarity to states and territories of those issues and areas which may be affected by the provisions of the bill. </span>

Most state governments and state councils are in huge debt. China, through Belt and Road, wants to go to Victoria and put up a lot of money to build infrastructure. This bill has come about because of concerns about China putting Belt and Road into Victoria. Why is it a concern of the federal government to not allow Victoria, or even local government, to be involved in Belt and Road? If they are signing up to these agreements, why is the federal government taking the stance of overriding their decisions?</span>

But we recognise that, internationally, Australia's strength is greatest when we are speaking with one voice as governments across Australia. That's the purpose the bill serves. This bill will assist us in ensuring a consistent approach to Australia's international relations, in Australia's national interest, reflecting the Commonwealth government's fundamental role in setting those foreign policy and foreign relations parameters. It's our role to negotiate treaties. It's our role to represent our nation internationally. We do think that this remedies a gap, therefore, in the existing system. States and territories do not have to advise or even consult the Commonwealth in relation to such arrangements. That is a large gap in the system. It gives the Commonwealth no line of sight, no vision of what state and territory governments are entering into. We believe that the mechanisms set out in the legislation are about protecting our national interest and, importantly, addressing the consistency of our foreign policy across all levels of Australian government.</span>

With Belt and Road, China actually put a lot of money into the Shanghai port. The port couldn't pay it back, so China took over the port. China is putting a lot of money into Belt and Road and the agreements that are made. They are using their own technology. Whether it is building a rail line or a computer system, they are using their own technology—and, in the future, you will always have to buy from China because you can't get the product from elsewhere. They are protecting their own interests. We will constantly have to buy from China. They are tying us up. We can't go outside those parameters because they have used all their knowledge, all their technology and all their infrastructure, and we are bound and tied to it.</span>

That's why we have an advanced manufacturing policy led by Karen Andrews, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. That's why we have been working across multiple bilateral relationships and in multilateral contexts on supply chain diversity to make sure that we never find ourselves in a position where we are strongly reliant on a very narrow cohort of suppliers. COVID-19 has brought that to the fore in about 90 per cent of all my international engagements in the last year.</span>

Coming from a manufacturing background, I know that people aren't serious when they start talking about 'advanced manufacturing'. The government allowed one of our core national capabilities, one of the industries that provided critical national capability—the Australian automotive industry—to go offshore. All this froth and bubble about national resilience, all this talk about supply chain diversity, counts for nothing after the government that you've been part of did everything in its power to force offshore not just the 40,000 jobs but the national resilience and innovation and capability that comes from that. Look offshore now at what the United Kingdom is doing, as just one example, with big investments in automotive capability that they see as precisely serving the policy objectives that you've been glossing over in terms of national resilience and supply chain capability. The Canadians have billions and billions of dollars going into green cars, into electric vehicles. For political sloganeering purposes, just last year and the year before, some joker in Liberal campaign land decided that an effort to invest in electric vehicles—which is the future of automotive engineering and automotive capability—was, in some way, an effort to take away people's weekends. It was the silliest thing that I'd ever heard. It was a self-defeating thing, because of the opportunity for us to re-engage with that most sophisticated, largest job-generating industry that also gives rise to the capacity for innovation and capability. It does make me wonder about the capacity of this government to think its way through the foreign relations problems that now confront it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened carefully yesterday and today, as we've been circling around this question, about why it is appropriate for the minister neither to consult prior to making a decision in relation to a foreign agreement that the states and territories may reach nor to provide reasons. One of the reasons I'm so apprehensive about this set of arrangements is that the government set the tone. I think the phrase that you used, Minister, was whether the Commonwealth should have a line of sight on the kinds of agreements that state, territory and local governments or universities are reaching with foreign entities. There is no contest at all on that question in this place. But I think the way that the bill has been formulated and the language that's been used by advocates for the bill in this place would give states and territories, and universities in particular, some real concerns about the arbitrariness of the power that the minister is proposing to exercise. I've heard you say that the power would be used in a robust way—I'm not sure what that means—that it wouldn't be used lightly and that there'd be processes in place. Those commitments are good, as far as they go. But, if you're the Premier of New South Wales or the Premier of Victoria, or you're a researcher in one of the institutions that the bill seeks to cover, your most recent experience of the government's engagement over this question is zero consultation in the formulation of the bill—zero. For the states and territories, there's been no engagement in the construction of this most important legislation. For the universities, there's been no engagement and no consultation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Paterson said yesterday, 'Why should they have that privilege?' That's not a position that this government would take if it were seeking to regulate the beef industry. It's not a position that the government would take if it were trying to change the regulations for the retail or finance sectors. It's a contemptuous way, really, of engaging with universities, so no wonder they are so apprehensive about the way that the Commonwealth is going to engage with them prospectively, if from our most recent experience over the last three weeks we've seen the government being so contemptuous of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that the legislation has two approaches that have been very confused. One is the arbitrariness in the minister's power of veto and the other is the softer, more educative line-of-sight propositions that the minister has advanced. It appears to me that there are twin sets of objectives, which could be reconciled in the legislation if a bill in a different form had been brought to this place. It's harder to reconcile those two objectives, because of the government's behaviour and, for example, the government's refusal to provide reasons. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I ask my questions, I would like to say that I have heard much criticism from the individual institutions in the university sector—although I have to say that some of the criticism from their peak organisations has been muted; you don't hear much of any substance from them—expressing deep concern about the character of the minister's power and, in particular, about the way that the government conducted itself by not consulting with the sector. Those criticisms have been aired in this place and they were aired substantially yesterday. I'd like to understand why the government conducted itself in the way that it did. What was the rationale for not consulting with the university sector in this case? Does the government recognise that that failure to consult has hurt its capacity to engage constructively? Primarily, Minister, I'd like to understand why the minister and the department chose, in the drafting process that we heard so much about in estimates, not to consult with the institutions that the bill seeks to cover.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Chair, I appreciate your assistance. Returning to the substantive matters: I was going to the four car companies which were manufacturers in Australia—Mitsubishi, Ford, Holden and Toyota. I acknowledge that Senator Ayres is right: Holden and Toyota did make the decision and did announce their decision to cease manufacturing in Australia under the first term of the Abbott government. However, as Senator Ayres should know and may have forgotten—or has chosen to forget—the departure of Mitsubishi was announced in 2008 under the Rudd government and the announcement of Ford's departure from manufacturing in Australia was in 2013 under the Gillard government. So two of the four Australian car manufacturers announced their departure under the Rudd-Gillard government, not under this government. To attribute the blame to this side of politics for those events is, I think, curious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the more substantive matters raised in Senate Ayres's contribution about this question of ministerial accountability for decisions made: I appreciate the perspective raised by the opposition and some crossbench senators on this question. But I do observe that in our system of government ministers are accountable to this parliament and governments are accountable to the people. If the opposition or any other member of this place is curious about a decision that the minister has made, if the minister does indeed make a decision to cancel an agreement, then they're free to ask the minister about that in this chamber. I look forward to them doing so if indeed that is the case. Ultimately, the government is accountable to the people for the decision it makes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reflecting on a contribution that Senator Rice made in this debate last night. She made the good point that, sadly, it may not be the case that Senator Payne will be foreign minister forever. I hope it is for a very long time, but one day perhaps she will be succeeded by another foreign minister. It may be Senator Wong who replaces her one day as foreign minister. It may be Senator Ayres or it may be Senator Kitching, given their interest in these matters. But, speaking as a Liberal senator, I will sleep very soundly at night knowing that it may be Senator Wong who retains this power in the future. I would much rather Senator Wong have this power to make this decision and much rather she exercise her judgement using this power and the judgement of the federal government on questions of national interest and foreign policy than any state premier, Labor or Liberal—let alone any local council mayor or any vice-chancellor. That's because I know that ultimately she will be informed by the best advice and the best expertise here in Canberra and because, fundamentally, I don't think there is a really profound difference on foreign policy across the chamber. Fundamentally, I think we substantially agree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm not troubled as Senator Rice is by the fact that the foreign ministry may change hands one day. I trust that an elected government and the person they choose to appoint as foreign minister will exercise that choice carefully and that any decisions they make will be subject to the scrutiny of this parliament and the Australian people.</span>

The first is that we do think this is a role for the federal government. But we also think that where there are substantial powers vested in any minister, as they are by this legislation—including to cancel agreements that elected state governments, elected territory governments and elected councils are engaged in—a modicum of notice and reasons for decisions are pretty reasonable propositions. I don't think that derogates from the central proposition asserted, which is that the federal government has responsibility for foreign relations.</span>

People were watching, including management, and they were astounded. I remember one of them confidentially—I won't give the name—saying to me: 'We have never seen something like this. We have been goaded to leave by the Treasurer of Australia.' And then they did. So every South Australian, every worker and every family who has suffered as a consequence of that decision knows that it was the coalition and a coalition Treasurer who not only turned their backs on the industry but, out of some ideological big he-man bent, stood on the floor of the parliament and goaded them to leave, and we will never forget it.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an amendment that requires the minister to provide an annual report to the Senate on the exercise of their decision-making power under the proposed act after each calendar year. It really goes to the point Senator Paterson made about accountability. It also prescribes the minimum contents of such reports, given we've seen reports provided by this government which avoid certain delicate topics that are actually important, such as the aged-care annual report and response to the royal commission report. In order to avoid the risk of vague and unhelpful reports, it requires statistical information about decisions and results, and the details of each decision. It's consistent with the recommendations of my colleagues on the Senate committee. It also requires an outline of the engagement that has occurred during the year with entities covered by the proposed act to articulate and explain those amendments to those entities, Australia's foreign policy and how they should engage with foreign entities in Australia's national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are conscious, being a responsible opposition, that some information may need to be redacted from tabled reports. The minister would be obliged to prepare two reports, a classified report and an unclassified report. The amendment requires the minister to table the unclassified report, but to give a copy of the classified report to the Leader of the Opposition, which they are under duty to keep secret. I would underline that this is precisely the same sort of arrangement which applies to intelligence agency reports—for example, under the ASIO legislation—which enables these classified reports to be filed to the Leader of the Opposition. It is important, obviously, to ensure that these sorts of issues are not weaponised or politicised in any way, and to ensure the bipartisanship on these sorts of national security matters is provided on the basis of reasonable shared information. Conscious of the national security matters inherent in the decision-making under the bill, the amendment provides that, before tabling the report, the minister may make redactions, as she or he considers necessary, in order to avoid prejudice to security, the defence of Australia, Australia's relations with other countries, law enforcement operations or the privacy of individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two aspects to this amendment. We're dealing with the first, which is the amendment to the bill, which requires the minister to provide an annual report to the Senate. When we move the report of the Committee of the Whole, when the minister does that, there is a motion for a continuing order, which requires these reports to be referred to Senator Abetz's committee, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, so that the authority for the committee examining the reports is pursuant to Senate order rather than the bill. I would have preferred the latter, but I am doing what the Clerk told me was the right thing to do. If this amendment is successful, we'll then move that amendment subsequently. We're conscious of the sensitivity required in the handling of national security matters, and we have taken that into account in relation to the drafting of both amendments.</span>

We do believe that the public register is going to be a very important process through which information is provided about the decisions that are made. It will enable the ascertaining of the minister's decisions on arrangements, in terms of the numbers and the outcomes of those arrangements; it will be completely publicly available to allow for that sort of public scrutiny over decision-making. It will help the states and territories to build a picture of the kinds of arrangements that might be deemed to be adverse to or inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy. It will include information about arrangements to support greater transparency. I think it is an important confidence-building mechanism for the public, for business and for state and territory entities themselves, that they can enter and deal with arrangements knowing they are consistent with Australia's foreign policy and foreign relations.</span>

It is very clear that there is going to be much more limited information on that public register—and, Minister, you just outlined some of the things that won't be on the public register—than we think is appropriate to be either publicly available or, in the case of sensitive information, to be redacted, to take account of that sensitivity. We note that there is not full transparency because of the provisions outlined in this proposed amendment to be able to redact sensitive information.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, the provision of annual reports is one of a suite of amendments that we and the Labor Party are moving, to try and improve the transparency and the accountability and to actually put some checks and balances in this legislation, because—for all of your words, Minister, that this is going to be a most wonderful, collaborative, open approach, where everything is going to be discussed with everybody else—there is nothing in the legislation that says that that's the way it has to be. All the legislation lays out is, basically, a framework that allows the government, if it wanted to, to come in, in an incredibly heavy-handed, non-consultative and completely over-the-top manner, without having to give any reasons for decisions that are being made, without having to account for itself, without having to give any reports and without the ability to review those decisions. It is a very authoritarian way of going about this piece of legislation and is completely at odds with the expressions that you have been using during this debate, Minister, of your commitment to a collaborative and open approach.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is to define what 'foreign relations' means in the bill. A consistent theme throughout all the discussion and debate we have had on this bill is that key terms and definitions are undefined or poorly defined. This is a very simple amendment. We think it would have been a pretty obvious thing to include a definition of foreign relations. We hope that it's a useful one that will provide clarity in the legislation about, indeed, the extent of what is covered by this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I again underline that the bill does not require the minister to provide any reasons for a decision and does not allow for any process of review or appeal by affected entities of ministerial decisions.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that a regime that provides no transparency of the minister's decision, no notice of the minister's decision, no requirement for the federal government to advise affected entities of its foreign policy settings and no guidance to ensure the alignment of governments and government related bodies right across Australia is not a scheme that provides the sort of transparency and enables the alignment of which the Prime Minister spoke. If the government wants to deliver on this promise it should provide guidance, and when the entities get it wrong they should explain why. That is, over time, the only way we can ensure the sort of alignment that is necessary at this time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also make the point that without procedural fairness, without a requirement to provide reasons and without capacity for review, this is a discretion that sits solely with the minister. There is no requirement to explain what Australia's foreign policy is and no requirement to explain how an arrangement is inconsistent with foreign policy. Now, I don't doubt the motivations of this minister. I've been critical of her performance, but I don't doubt her motivations. But any minister may make decisions with regard to all kinds of matters under this legislation, given the broad discretion given to the minister under the bill. For example, it's not unimaginable that a federal government of one political persuasion might take issue with an arrangement that is beneficial to a state or territory government of another political persuasion, and we have seen that in the way in which the government here has chosen to attack Premier Andrews through the media without actually sitting down and having a chat.</span>

                    </a>  Being told to grow up by Senator Rennick is one of the highlights of my career, I reckon! Look, I think that whatever people's views are on the BRI—and I've made my views clear—if we're serious about safeguarding Australia's sovereignty in the context of the sort of strategic and geopolitical environment that Australia is in, then there actually has to be a degree of unity and a degree of working together. My criticism of the federal government is that they have chosen to play this through the media for political purposes rather than actually trying to resolve it. As I said, at the same time they refuse to release their own secret BRI deals—and it's a pity Senator Rennick wasn't here to hear that—which Mr Ciobo entered into. The minister can exercise powers under this regime to cancel an arrangement without the need to provide reasons, without any notice and without the capacity for review, and people wouldn't even know what factors the minister took into account; only the minister would know that. So we've taken a responsible approach in drafting the amendments to ensure that the government's concerns are dealt with, including the need for sensitivity in publishing details of Australia's foreign policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the government, if you want to deliver on what Mr Morrison promised in announcing this regime—transparency, leadership and alignment—you would accept these arrangements. The statement of reasons that we have drafted would include, whether, if in making the decisions, the minister is satisfied or not satisfied of a foreign relations matter or had ceased to be satisfied of a foreign relations matter, an explanation for the basis on which the minister reached that position and, in particular, foreign relations, foreign policy or other considerations involved and an explanation of how matters have been taken into account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister raised earlier, as a justification for non-inclusion of national security sensitivities, I again make this point, that in recognition of national security sensitivities, this amendment does not—I repeat does not—require information to be included in a statement of reasons if disclosure of that information is, or is likely to be, protected by public interest immunity of which obviously national security grounds aren't a ground. The opposition has provided that the threshold for withholding information on the basis of a PII, public interest immunity, claim is that the minister believes on reasonable grounds that the information is subject to public interest immunity. I outline that because that is a very substantial protection of national security or other information that a minister reasonably believes should be excluded on the basis of public interest immunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has said a number of times that she has put judicial review into the legislation. I make this point: judicial review of ministerial decisions has limited utility without a requirement for a minister to provide reasons for decision. It also limits the ability of Australian entities to comply with the legislation. These amendments establish a right of review of decisions under the act by the AAT. They require the minister to provide reasons to affected entities and for entities to have the capacity to appeal them. They insert a new clause in the bill, itemising decisions that would be reviewable. We have specified that the review function should be conferred on the security division of the AAT so that the procedural requirements for classified evidence apply. For the purposes of this clause, a foreign relations matter means a matter that relates to whether or not a particular action would or would not adversely affect, or would be likely or unlikely to adversely affect, Australian foreign relations, or be inconsistent with Australian foreign policy amongst other things, to summarise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has not been interested in engaging on this. These are very sensible amendments. It is a very substantial power. The Labor Party doesn't believe the minister should have this kind of untrammelled power to veto agreements that sovereign state governments and territory governments have entered into without at least providing reasons for the decisions and having some capacity to be accountable for them.</span>

I appreciate the matters that Senator Wong has raised but we believe they are covered within the provisions of the bill.

The minister's decisions are made public through the register. They are open for all to see and to scrutinise. They are made on the basis of Australia's foreign policy, which is the purview of the Commonwealth government. It's determined by the minister in consultation and processes through the Prime Minister, the cabinet process, advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. These decisions will be robust decisions, as I have said before. They will be made in the public interest and with the transparency and accountability that is appropriate in the context of the nature of those decisions.</span>

They are a very similar result to an amendment that we're also putting forward. Having to provide reasons for decisions, having the ability to challenge those decisions, is fundamental. It's part of a framework where you have got accountability. We believe that accountability is fundamental to having a framework of actually working collaboratively together. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think all of us here are on the same page when we think, 'Yes, it would be the best outcome if we have the Commonwealth, the state and territory governments, universities and local governments all on the same page, not cutting across each other and not making decisions that are in conflict with the decisions that the others are making.' If you've got a problem where that's occurring, the question is: how do you address it? I've done a lot of work in bringing groups of people together to work out how they can work together, see what their common aims are, see what their common purposes are and reach solutions together. I can tell you there is only one way to do it that will last, and that is to genuinely work together collaboratively, to genuinely talk with each other, to genuinely listen to each other, to genuinely hear and learn from each other and then to work together. The way that you do that is you set up a framework for those discussions that ensures that that's going to occur. You cannot have a framework where, despite lots of good words at the beginning, saying, 'Yes, we are going to work collaboratively, transparently and in an accountable way,' at the end of the day all the power rests with one person. That's the problem that we have with this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A framework actually set up for the states and Commonwealth to work together but which doesn't vest all that overarching power into the hands of the minister would be the way forward. There is clearly room for improvement compared with where we're currently at. As I said earlier, I don't think it is appropriate for state governments to be going off and signing the Belt and Road Initiative with China that the Commonwealth had no knowledge of or engagement in. That's not a sensible way forward. But there is a vast gulf between that situation and what's being proposed here. You can set up a framework that addresses that that doesn't then place all the power in the hands of the foreign minister in a way that does not have to be accountable. Yes, Minister, you might be committed to being accountable. You personally might be committed to providing reasons. Personally, your way of working may be collaborative. But, unless it's laid out in the legislation, it does haven't to occur. Unless you have guidelines for the decisions, a requirement to lay out guidelines for the reasons why a decision is being made and a requirement to actually provide reasons back to people to whom you are saying that arrangement can no longer occur, unless that is in the legislation, it doesn't have to occur. That is our concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure that it would have been possible to get a piece of legislation that addressed the vast majority of what you wanted to achieve with this legislation with multipartisan support, because there is support around this chamber and around this parliament for what I think the intent of this legislation is—to address the problem of making sure that those arrangements are in Australia's national interest. But the fact that you are not willing to accommodate very sensible amendments that put in place a framework of accountability shows that that cooperation is not present. That's why we are having to have this debate here today. It means that you're not going to get support from us. I don't understand the reasons. In fact, I don't think there have been sufficient reasons given as to why these very sensible amendments are not being supported by the government. Your response was, 'There are potential threats to our bilateral arrangements.' That's not a reason. There is room in this amendment to be able to redact information that is sensitive and shouldn't be in the public eye. This blanket approach of no guidelines, no review and no reasons for decisions is complete overreach and is setting up a regime that has the potential to be misused in the future.</span>

Within the legislation there is the process of judicial review; the parameters of the foreign policy test, which I have set out in the chamber in this debate; the limited scope of the coverage; the matters in section 51 which the foreign minister must take into account; and the public register itself. The rules, of course, are disallowable and, of course, the legislation was amended by the government in the House of Representatives to also incorporate a three-year review which will give the parliament and the government the ability to address any prospective changes or amendments to the process.</span>

They are substantively similar to the amendments the Labor Party moved earlier, although there is some conflict in terms of the right of review.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  During the last sitting week, I made some remarks with respect to the result of the Queensland state election.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SCARR:</span>
                  </a>  Senator Watt, hubris is a dangerous thing. I want to further my earlier remarks: at the outset, I note that the member for Bundaberg, Mr David Batt, did lose his seat and was unsuccessful in his effort for re-election, and I also note that Mr Marty Hunt was unsuccessful in his efforts to seek re-election to the seat of Nicklin. I want to say to both of those gentlemen that my thoughts are with them. I thought they were both outstanding local members. I spent some time with David in Bundaberg earlier this year and saw firsthand the concern that he had for his community in relation to issues such as the Paradise Dam. I also attended a function with David where he hosted local school captains at an annual function he convened, and, again, it was an absolute delight to watch that engagement between David and those school students. My heartfelt best wishes go to you, David, and also to Marty Hunt. I think it's a measure of Marty as a person that no-one could have been more gracious in terms of how he handled the situation after he lost his seat. Politics can be an extremely cruel game. I think both David and Marty represent the best of community-minded people seeking to represent their electorates to the best of their efforts, and I pay tribute to them both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I'd like to offer my congratulations to Mr David Crisafulli, a very good friend of mine, who has become the state Leader of the Opposition. David is the son of canefarmers. I've met David's parents and they're extremely decent people, and, in David's case, the apple has not fallen far from the tree. I think he might have been the youngest councillor on the Townsville City Council, and he progressed to become Deputy Mayor of Townsville, before being elected to the state seat of Mundingburra in Townsville. I first really came across David one night when I was listening to the radio while driving home, and I heard him give maybe his first interview as local government minister. I was immediately impressed by how thoughtful and considered he was in the course of that interview. From that moment on, in my own mind, I tagged him as someone who I thought would go on to even greater things. And such is the case, as he has now been elevated to the position of state opposition leader. I was fortunate enough to attend one of his first events as state opposition leader, a Diwali festival celebration at Brisbane City Hall. The Australian Indian community was highly impressed by the contribution that he made that evening. I think David will do a fantastic job in leading the LNP to the 2024 state election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our state deputy opposition leader is another David, Mr David Janetzki. David grew up in a small town called Acland as the son of dairy farmers, and his first job was milking cows. He rose from those beginnings to be General Counsel of what was then the Heritage Building Society, based in Toowoomba, which is the context in which I first came across him, when I was a company secretary and general counsel in a former life. He immediately struck me, in that capacity, as being someone who was considered, reasoned and deliberate, and someone you should take very, very seriously. One of the standout features of David is the way in which he's brought together his community in Toowoomba South. It's become quite a multicultural community. Many people have come to Toowoomba. Some of them have refugee backgrounds. David has done an absolutely sterling job of knitting his community together in terms of promoting social inclusion and making sure that everyone feels part of his community. So I think he will make an outstanding deputy state opposition leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also congratulate all those members who've become part of the shadow opposition team. I'm really pleased that Deb Frecklington—who, of course, was the opposition leader at the time of the last state election—has been appointed opposition spokesperson with respect to water, dams and regional development. One of the great visionary concepts to emerge from the last state election was Deb's vision in relation to the New Bradfield Scheme. That was inspired by two great Queensland public servants of Queensland's past: Sir Leo Hielscher and Sir Frank Moore. I'm really pleased that Deb has the opportunity to continue working on that vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, Tim Mander—the deputy state opposition leader going into the last state election and, famously, a former referee of great renown—has been given the portfolio in opposition of housing and public works. Tim did an absolutely fantastic job in that portfolio as a minister in Campbell Newman's government. I say to all of the members of the opposition team: you have my support, you have my friendship and I look forward to working with each and every one of you over the next four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gravity of the task ahead of them in the next four years was underlined by the Queensland state budget which was announced yesterday. Queensland was the last state in the country to release a budget in 2020. Of course, we Queenslanders were concerned about that, because we thought, 'Gee, there's got to be a reason why they're not prepared to release a budget before the state election.' It wasn't going to be good. It couldn't be a good reason. And, sure enough, the proof is in the pudding. Whilst during the election campaign the Labor Party continually told Queenslanders that they would borrow $4 billion to pay for their election commitments, we now see, revealed on Tuesday, that the Queensland government borrowings will be seven times that amount. Not $4 billion, not $8 billion, not $12 billion—but $28 billion across the next four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Operating deficits over the next four years will only equate to $16.8 billion, and yet Labor will rack up an additional $28 billion in state borrowings. Before the election, Labor told Queenslanders that debt would go to $106 billion. And then, just four weeks after the election, the Queensland government announced debt would go up to $130 billion. That's an extra $24 billion in just four weeks after the state election. It's $6 billion a week extra. Before the election, Labor told Queenslanders that they were borrowing to protect jobs. And yet, despite racking up the biggest debt in state history, unemployment is forecast to still be the worst in the nation in four years time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Labor and the Treasurer, the Hon. Cameron Dick, compared Queensland's debt with New South Wales and Victoria. It's not as bad; it's not as bad as New South Wales and Victoria. But, of course, what he forgets to mention, or deliberately does not mention, is the fact that Queensland only has, say, two-thirds or three-quarters of the economy of New South Wales and Victoria. On a per capita basis, the Queensland government debt is extraordinarily bad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To get out of this situation, what Queensland needs is economic growth, private sector development, jobs and activity. We need to grow our way out of this debt situation. What Queensland needs is a slowing of the rate of increase in the bureaucracy—the number of public servants. What Queensland needs is a vision to provide every single Queenslander, wherever they live—whether they live in Brisbane or in the great northern part of our state or in Western Queensland—with the opportunity to fulfil their potential.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  [by video link] I would like you all to imagine this situation: you resign from a job, as most people do from time to time, your colleagues say farewell, there are drinks and speeches and you might even get a present, and your former employer charges you with your own personal jet, at a cost of more than $4,000 per hour flying, for weeks on end so you can try to get a new job. Doesn't this sound like the most utterly absurd thing you have ever heard? Truly, it is really utterly ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one in the private sector would believe this, and yet this is exactly what Mr Morrison has allowed to happen. There are tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas, and Mr Morrison is using a government RAAF aeroplane to fly Mr Cormann—not Senator Cormann—from meeting to meeting across Europe in his campaign to be the secretary-general of the OECD. Mr Cormann's stops have included Brussels, Luxembourg, Madrid, Bern, Copenhagen, Slovenia, Ankara and Muscat and covered more than 20,000 kilometres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison stated that this jet was necessary because Mr Cormann could get COVID-19 if he flew commercially. We all know there is a global pandemic, which is why the Australian government's advice on Smartraveller for Europe is 'do not travel'. There's a ban on international travel from Australia, which begs the question: why is Mr Cormann travelling and what does he do when he gets to these places? Does he stay on the plane, masked up, and are his meetings held in hazmat suits? Obviously not. Given he is facing COVID exposure in all his meetings and travelling outside of the plane, is the use of the taxpayer funded plane really mitigating his risk? I presume he uses cars and is in restaurants, on the streets and in meetings with others when he's in these other cities. In a photo—a promotional shot—I saw him cooking on an Australian barbecue in Germany and he wasn't even wearing a mask, but, in all fairness, I don't think the barbecue was turned on either. Does Mr Morrison not think about the thousands of Australians in COVID hotspots around Europe that are at risk every single day they stay there? How many Australians could have been brought back by now while Mr Cormann is flying around Europe at taxpayer expense?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not like these trips are, in fact, necessary. Former senator Natasha Stott Despoja has just successfully been elected to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and this was done by her campaigning almost entirely from home. She held over 200 meetings via teleconference. I'm unaware of the government also offering the former Senator Stott Despoja the use of a government aircraft for her single trip to Washington and Canberra during the selection process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the planes that you, taxpayers, are paying for. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is supporting Mr Cormann's campaign with a task force of eight staff. He is also accompanied by one DFAT officer while overseas. Seriously, if we can make military planes available to send Mr Cormann around the globe so that he can interview for a new job, surely we can send our planes to bring our fellow Australians home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Cormann must be Australia's most expensive jobseeker. There are over a million Australians on the JobSeeker payment, and I'm sure they'd all be happy with the same level of assistance. The Prime Minister says, 'If you have a go, you will get a go.' It's a lot easier to have a go if you get a fully paid RAAF jet, eight staff and unlimited support from the government. The former Treasurer, and a fellow jobs-for-the-boys recipient, Joe Hockey once said that the age of entitlement is over. This is clearly not the case if you're a friend of the Prime Minister. Mr Morrison and his government are so seriously out of touch it's not even funny; we shouldn't really even joke about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the flip side of this overly generous support by the Morrison government for their mates are the workers who have been abandoned completely by the government. In fact, their rights and conditions are so bad they aren't even classified as employees. I'm talking now about the plight of drivers for food delivery services. These workers can be found around restaurants and fast-food outlets hoping to pick up a delivery gig. If they're lucky, this delivery might return them $5. They have no minimum wage and no guaranteed conditions. They ride or drive around the streets delivering food as quickly as they can for our convenience, risking their lives in the process. All this is done without adequate workplace safety protections—generally there are none at all—or workers compensation. Tragically, there have been five delivery riders killed on our roads since September, including two deaths in just three days. I fear that there will be quite a few more. Each of these workers have left families and loved ones devastated by their loss. Due to the arrangements of their employment, their families are not entitled to compensation for their death nor to financial support. As a nation, we've really got to do better than this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many workers die on our roads. A couple of weeks ago it was National Road Safety Week, when we recognised that approximately 1,200 people had been killed and another 44,000 seriously injured on Australian roads. It's now time to recognise that the work conditions of delivery drivers working for delivery apps in the gig economy are causing unsafe conditions on our roads, not just for them but for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gig economy work is poorly paid and it's insecure. We've seen drivers, such as Amita Gupta, lose their jobs for being 10 minutes late with one delivery. With the assistance of the Transport Workers Union, Ms Gupta brought the case to the Fair Work Commission as an unfair dismissal claim. This required the commission to first decide if she was an employee. Unfortunately, the commission found that Ms Gupta was not an employee, nor was she conducting a business in her own right. What was she doing, then? When is a job not a job? Who do we think was out there delivering peoples' meals for just a few bucks? Why do we think she was doing it—because she just liked driving? Of course not. She was working to earn money to pay the bills. The Fair Work Commission found that Ms Gupta had:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the capacity to develop her own independent delivery business as a result of her legal and practical right to seek and accept other types of work while performing work for Uber Eats, but chose not to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Gupta didn't want to found a logistics company; she just wanted a job to pay the bills. You shouldn't have to be Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk to have rights at work. We can't apply the same rules we apply to genuine independent contractors to somebody, usually on a working visa, who has bought a second-hand bike to get some extra cash when they have no other means of support. Don't forget that many of these people have had no government support at all through COVID.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael Kaine, from the Transport Workers Union, outlined some of the issues in the sector. He recently said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Riders are being put onto bikes with no training or protective gear, they are working our streets day and night for little pay. They have no right to insurance and when they get injured or die, it's at the discretion of their companies as to whether they and their families get supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That state of affairs is appalling. Everybody in Australia should be able to work in safe conditions. They need rights at work and they need protection. These workers are not being looked after and they are being denied rights as employees. Due to the failure of the government to adequately protect these workers, the Transport Workers Union has had to step up and create a crowdfunding campaign to provide support to the families of the workers who have been killed simply doing their jobs. We're talking about a crowdfunding campaign to pay for funeral expenses and other costs for workers who died doing their job. Workers in Australia deserve better. The government just can't ignore this issue. It cannot be considered acceptable for people to be working at such low rates of pay, lower than anywhere else would allow and without any rights, simply because this is the new technology. If the government doesn't take action to make the delivery service industry safer then, sadly, we'll see further deaths on our roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So when you do use one of these apps to order your takeaway while settling down for a nice evening in, I'd like you to take a moment to think about your delivery rider or driver. Think about the dangers they face and think about what sort of training, equipment and insurance you would like if you were doing the same job and were in the same situation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  The Carmichael coalmine proposed by the Adani Group is a triple-bottom-line dud. It's a financial dud, it's a social dud and it's an environmental dud, and it's proposed by a company which has an appalling track record, particularly socially and environmentally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adani Group and its cheerleaders in the Australian government initially promised up to 10,000 jobs would be created by the Carmichael coalmine. But the Adani Group was forced to admit later in court that in fact it would actually be fewer than 1,500 jobs. This figure too was later downgraded in the Senate by Senator McKenzie, who qualified that the 1,468 jobs only applied to the construction phase of the project and that ongoing there would only be around 100 jobs. So it would be 100 jobs for a massive carbon bomb that does not have the support of the traditional owners of the land for which it is proposed and which, if it does proceed, will be developed by a company that uses dodgy tax havens in the Cayman Islands to hide its assets and revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adani Group has a truly woeful record on human rights. A power station is being constructed by the Adani Group in India near the town of Godda. This is where it is intended that most of the Carmichael coal will be transported to and burnt. In March 2017, as part of the Indian government's approvals process for the power station, a public meeting was organised. At this so-called public meeting, Adani officials were required to hear claims relating to the environmental damage that its project might cause, including the degradation of domestic water supplies for local communities, and to present this information in its environmental impact assessment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adani Group has already drained and polluted local groundwater through industrial bores, and local villagers have said that further impacts on their water could determine whether they can in fact stay in their villages or are forced to leave the region and abandon their way of life to find labour work in the cities. However, according to local Adivasi villagers, Adani officials and a large contingent of police forcibly prevented local dissenters from attending the meeting. Those people were only admitted as proceedings were being officially adjourned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it wasn't just people's democratic rights that took a hit that day; it was their bodies and their children's bodies, with reports of men, women and children being charged down and assaulted by the police with batons and bricks. As a result, when environmental approval was granted for the project, no mention was made of the exclusion of landowners, the premature adjournment of the meeting or indeed any local opposition to the project. And although these arrests were formally reported to police, no-one was ever arrested for these crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the corrupt, bullyboy company that the Australian government has jumped into bed with—and, for that matter, that the Queensland government has jumped into bed with. This is the company that the Australian and Queensland governments want to sell our environment-destroying coal to. It is this company whose pockets the Australian and Queensland governments want to line by using Australian taxpayers' money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Proponents of the Carmichael coalmine, including the Commonwealth government, also use the red-herring argument that the Carmichael coalmine will create jobs in poor regions of India, like Godda, and improve the living conditions of all Indians by providing them with cheap coal-fired power. What they don't tell you is that the electricity generated by the dirty coal power station in Godda will actually be sold to Bangladesh. It will provide the local indigenous villages with nothing at all—no benefits in return for their lands, their culture and the violence that's been perpetrated against them. What the government won't tell you is that Adani will be profiting from Bangladeshi power tariffs, ultimately paid for by Bangladeshi people, when they could instead provide solar power for consumption in India for just 40 per cent of the cost of coal power. Who else would Australia be sharing the Adani bed with? The bagmen for the Myanmar military, the Myanmar Economic Corporation—the same military responsible for the genocide of the Rohingya people, thousands of whom have now fled to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations has recommended that no business should enter into an economic relationship with Myanmar's armed forces or any enterprise they control. According to Australian human rights lawyer Chris Sidoti, who investigated the Rohingya genocide for the UN, through Adani Australian coal will be helping to fund the operations of the Tatmadaw, the armed forces, and enriching the generals in Myanmar. The UN report Mr Sidoti co-authored for the UN said it found conclusive evidence that the actions of the country's armed forces undoubtedly amounted to the gravest crimes under international law against the Rohingya people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I move to the planet—our climate and our environment. The Carmichael coalmine will see increased shipping traffic through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. As a direct threat to the Great Barrier Reef this will significantly increase the chances of a ship grounding, which would be an ecological disaster for this unique and fragile marine ecosystem. Adani has been responsible for countless environmental breaches in India, including the sinking of the unseaworthy MV<span style="font-style:italic;"> Rak</span> off Mumbai which at that time was carrying 60,000 tonnes of coal. Indirectly, the mining, movement and burning of coal from the Carmichael coalmine will affect the Great Barrier Reef by significantly contributing to global temperature rise, which obviously will lead to more coral bleaching. I remind senators that 50 per cent of the coral cover of the Great Barrier Reef is now dead after three severe bleaching events in the last five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adani Group, through a joint venture with Wilmar, is also a major refiner and trader in palm oil—an industry responsible for devastating huge areas of rainforest, particularly in South-East Asia. This includes the development of a major port in Myanmar leasing land from the Myanmar Economic Corporation—as I said, the financial front for the brutal Myanmar armed forces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">India is the world's biggest consumer of palm oil, outstripping even China and the European Union. Adani Wilmar's palm oil operations have also been found to violate the human rights of people who live in the local affected areas, including the dispossession of indigenous peoples and forced labour. The Adani Group is also responsible for strip mining large tracts of biodiverse forest, including elephant habitat, and destroying waterways and fisheries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adani Group has benefited from human rights violations and environmental degradation associated with many of its commercial operations. Some of the abuses have been carried out by governments acting for the benefit of the Adani Group, and the Australian government is one of them. That the Australian government is in bed with the Adani Group while this parliament considers Magnitsky-style laws to impose sanctions on people who commit human rights abuses would be funny if it wasn't so devastatingly sad. By its actions, both in Australia and around the world, the Adani Group has forfeited any claims to a social licence to operate in Australia and it is time they were sent packing from this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Incredibly importantly, we all know—or should know—is the role coal is playing in cooking our planet. It is completely unconscionable for any government to even consider allowing such a devastating project as the Carmichael coalmine, proposed by such a dodgy, serial lawbreaking company as the Adani Group, to proceed here in Australia or anywhere else in the world. It is time that we prevented this carbon bomb from exploding, and it is beyond time that the truth about the Adani Group's track record was placed on the record and made public.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  Australia is at a critical time in our history. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an economic crisis the likes of which has not been seen in Australia for generations. It has restricted economic activity, disrupted supply chains and limited the movement of goods and people. It's led to high levels of unemployment and a recession. It's exposed Australia's reliance on other countries for manufactured goods, particularly those that are critical to health services, and our dependence on global supply chains. It has exposed our limited manufacturing capability, particularly the ability to pivot and adapt in times of national crisis to produce the goods we need. We need to have strategic capability in our own country, onshore. We have fragile supply chains for a variety of reasons. We can't always rely on trading partners for the services we need offshore. We need to start making Australia make again, and regional Australia has a significant role in doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national COVID task force has identified the need to reinvigorate and bolster Australia's manufacturing capability. Regional Australia is perfectly placed to lead our manufacturing recovery. Regional Australia is the engine room of the Australian economy, and it has been for more than a century. Back in 1873, Melbourne blacksmith John Furphy embraced the opportunities of living in Victoria's Goulburn Valley to expand and grow his business. Now, 147 years later, not only is the Furphy name synonymous with a refreshing ale but also J Furphy &amp; Sons and Furphy Foundry is a regional Australian manufacturing success story. Today there are thousands of manufacturing success stories right across regional Australia. Derwent Industries is 100 per cent Australian owned and operated by the Evans Group. Doug Evans' vision and that of his sons, Stuart and Craig, is to ensure that their Wodonga manufacturing site expands to make Australia self-sufficient in crucial water and gas pipe-fitting components, instead of relying on Chinese imports, and at the same time growing a new export market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's innovation and vision from regional manufacturers, and not just in my home state of Victoria. Marquis Macadamias, based in Bundaberg, Queensland, and in Lismore, New South Wales, is a visionary regional cooperative food processor. It is 100 per cent Australian grower owned, and it's the world's largest macadamia processor. This regional business adapts other nut processing technologies to their needs through research and development. Theirs is a simple strategy: to be the world leaders in macadamias. It is that innovation that builds their competitiveness, and they need trade settings to support that ambition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm excited by our government's investment of $1.5 billion over the next four years for our modern manufacturing strategy, supporting six national manufacturing priorities: resources, technology and critical minerals processing; food and beverage—and I'd like to see fibre manufacturing added to that; medical products; recycling and clean energy; defence; and space. Consider this list. This list is full of existing manufacturers operating in rural and regional Australia. The Nupress group, based in Cardiff in New South Wales, manufactures leading-edge products for the mining, building, aerospace, defence and medical industries. It's a great regional business, supplying the world with highly sophisticated parts for fighter jets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank both the Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals and HunterNet Co-operative in Newcastle for inviting me to the Hunter Valley region last week so that I could better understand the opportunities and the challenges that manufacturing businesses in regional areas face. And there are some challenges to overcome. Regional development frameworks remain fragmented. Rising energy costs have an impact on the competitiveness of existing and emerging advanced manufacturers in Australia. One thing I heard about time and again from these advanced manufacturers was the lack of skilled workers in the regions. That is why education is so vital. Universities need to equip their graduates and their researchers need to engage with small to medium enterprises, not simply the big boys, and be flexible and adaptive enough to do that. And our TAFE system needs a complete overhaul. We also need to harmonise trade qualifications across TAFEs, so that businesses operating in border towns or across jurisdictions can get the apprentices that they need and move their workforce as required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have known for a long time that our research and development pipeline framework just isn't working. We are lagging behind the world in our investment in the framework and the commercialisation of our innovations. We need to catch up and we also need to join up our infrastructure—and not just hard infrastructure such as roads, rail, ports and assisting with the freight task but also our communications infrastructure, which is so important for advanced manufacturing to grow and prosper. However, there is an abundance of opportunity for advanced manufacturing in regional Australia. Proximity to raw materials, such as our fabulous agricultural products and our energy and mineral resources, will prove advantageous through the establishment of vertically integrated supply chains. Our regions are also blessed with an abundance of natural resources and highly advanced resources and agricultural sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes no sense to talk about advanced manufacturing while we send our raw products overseas for processing, only to pay a premium when those finished products return to our shelves from overseas. There's considerable scope to move regional Australia up the value chain by focusing on the entire supply chain, not just the original raw product. There are now plenty of jobs in regional communities and a growing population base to supply a skilled workforce for manufacturers looking to expand. ABS data shows that regional Australia attracted 65,000 more people than it lost to capital cities, which is fabulous news, because it shows that we're turning around the brain drain that we've experienced over previous decades. Our city millennials know about the appealing life in regional cities and towns. A recent report by the Regional Australia Institute showed that more millennials have moved from Melbourne and Sydney. Sydney experienced a net loss of 37,000 people because, as we in the regions know, life in the regions is good and you can have a great lifestyle and a great sustainable career in regional Australia doing something you love. We have room to live, grow and play, and I think COVID-19 has highlighted that the enjoyment in having extra space in regions is much prized. We've seen a renewed interest and a significant increase in real estate inquiries in regional cities and towns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Black Jack' McEwen, Australia's most significant and longest-serving Minister for Trade, who forged our post-Second World War economic boom, said, 'Australia is one of the few countries in the world that is not only self-sufficient in food and important raw materials but has an export surplus in these things.' He went on to say, 'It would be a great mistake if our manufacturing potential were to be neglected or underestimated.' I share John McEwen's vision for a strong, prosperous and sovereign Australia that actually enjoys the security benefits of an industrialised economy and an advanced manufacturing sector employing hundreds of thousands of Australians. Economic security means jobs. We need to get our production lines humming, we need to restore our sovereign manufacturing capability and we need to make Australia make again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  This year has been marred by crises: first the bushfires, then COVID-19, both contributing to a deep and damaging jobs crisis. The government have a choice for how to approach our recovery. They can deliver a big, bold jobs plan—a plan with heart; a plan that uses the levers of government to improve people's lives—or they can pull out the bottom drawer and use these crises to get out the tired old Liberal Party playbook. And right now, in the middle of a global pandemic, in the middle of our worst economic crisis for a hundred years, people are struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response to our recovery has been as disappointing as it was predictable, because it is straight out of the Liberal Party playbook. Those in this government are focused on slogans, not solutions. They're focused on cutting people's incomes and support. They're focused on slashing JobKeeper and JobSeeker before people get back on their feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they're focused on freezing the super guarantee. Even though a super rise is legislated, we know that this government is going to use the cover of the Retirement Income Review and the cover of COVID-19 to freeze super, using the false claim that this is going to help wages rise. So is this really what they've got, to rebuild our economy? Is this really what they've got, to rebuild our country—threatening people that they can't have a super rise or their wages will suffer? Is it really what they've got—asking people to believe that, if they forgo a legislated super increase, they'll somehow magically get a pay rise? Is this really what they've got—asking people to accept a super freeze, when 2.8 million people have already raided their own super to get through these tough times? And now those same people are looking ahead for a way out of this crisis, only to see the government wanting to freeze their future super. So, again, is this really what the government have got—wasting this recovery, wasting this opportunity and using it to bring out their old, tired, nasty cuts?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are concerned. They're concerned about their future. They're seeing big businesses letting workers go. They're surrounded by upheaval. They're seeing small businesses failing. They want a government that delivers practical solutions for their lives, not tired old ideological positions. But what we have is a government whose only plan for people's future is to take away their future savings. This is a government that has missed the opportunity to recover bigger and stronger with a big, strong jobs plan—a jobs plan that rebuilds Australian manufacturing, gets started on big transformative infrastructure projects, addresses the skills crisis by reinvesting in TAFE, recharges the workforce participation of women, invests in social housing to change lives and powers our recovery with clean energy projects and renewables. We need a plan that is committed to rebuilding good, secure jobs—jobs people can count on; jobs people can plan a future on. Where is this plan? Where is the vision? Where is the national leadership? Missing in action—that's where.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the best this government can come up with is cutting the superannuation guarantee, we are in serious trouble. But we've known that this was coming for a while. It was not too long ago that the minister responsible for superannuation, Senator Hume, said she was 'ambivalent' about the legislated rise—ambivalent about the government sticking to its promise. 'Ambivalent'! This is the minister who should be superannuation's strongest advocate, its strongest champion. Around the same time, Senator Bragg chimed in to say: 'It is not a good time to raise the super guarantee.' Well, for the Liberals, it's never a good time to raise super. When the economy is booming? No, it's not a good time. When the economy is in recession? That's not a good time. And it seems that this has now become the Liberals' superannuation policy: 'It's not a good time.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation is about the dignified retirement of hardworking Australians, and yet those in this government are ambivalent about that. They are ambivalent about Australians having decent standards in their retirement. I can assure you that Labor is not ambivalent about Australians' retirement incomes, and we know how the government are trying to sell this freeze. They say that going ahead with the super guarantee will hurt wages growth. But there's a big problem with that argument, and that is the last seven years of this government, because the government already cancelled the scheduled super increases, saying that that would improve pay for workers. And then, for seven years, they presided over the lowest wage growth on record. What followed was low wage growth that continues to this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Super has been frozen, wages have not gone up and workers have ended up being worse off—workers like Julia. Julia is a family service worker and domestic violence support volunteer, a proud ASU member and a fellow Victorian who has already lost out on over $4,800 since the 2014 freeze, and that's not counting the interest that she has lost as well. If the super guarantee freeze continues at its current rate of 9.5 per cent, the average loss will be over $1,600 per person per year. A young family could lose up to $240,000 in retirement savings by the time they reach their retirement. That is a huge amount of money. How is that going to help anyone? How is it going to help the recovery? Is it fair? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This freeze will disproportionately impact on women's retirement. Women already retire with 50 per cent less super than men on average. They are already at higher risk of experiencing poverty in retirement. So this cut from the government is a huge blow to closing the gap on retirement income. Everybody deserves to retire with dignity—everyone! But, for many, continuing the freeze on super is going to rob them of that dignified retirement they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, this has nothing to do with evidence based policy and it has nothing to do with sensible decision-making with the aim of supporting hardworking Australians or doing what is best for Australia. This is to do with the Liberals' tired, old, nasty, ideological obsessions. In the last year, government MPs and senators have said over and over again that they want to cut super entitlements. They've said they want to make super voluntary. They've even suggested scrapping it altogether. Senator Rennick has called superannuation a 'cancer', even going so far as to attack his own party for ever supporting super. He believes that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the coalition sold out its … values when it didn't stop this cancer called superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't stop with Senator Rennick. Senator Bragg believes there needs to be 'drastic surgery' to Australia's superannuation funds. I think we can all imagine what that drastic surgery would look like, because last year Senator Bragg told us how he thought superannuation should be voluntary for low-income workers, an idea that would leave low-income workers paying more tax and having even less super in their retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why do the Liberals keep saying these things? Why do they keep freezing the super guarantee? There is one simple answer. The Liberals do not support universal superannuation. They do not. They have never supported it. They have opposed every dollar that's been put into super since its creation. Pursuing this ideological hatred of super is more important to them right now than delivering a strong and inclusive recovery. This is what they have chosen to go with. This is why they've spent our worst economic crisis for 100 years attacking workers' retirements rather than doing their jobs and delivering a big-picture plan for our recovery—a big, bold jobs plan, a plan with heart and a plan that gives Australians hope for the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to respond to Senator Waters's speech in which she claimed the need to declare a climate emergency. She's acting. Her opening statement says it all—'The Greens are moving this motion because the New Zealand government has declared a climate emergency.' That's it! There's no data, no empirical scientific evidence and no scientific reasoning with a framework proving cause and effect, just, 'We're going to do it because the Kiwis have said it.' That's it. That is the summary of climate change in this country and globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then she raised pollution, meaning carbon dioxide as a pollutant. At the same time, she was exhaling 100 times the concentration of pollution of carbon dioxide that she was taking in. This is absurd. She's always exhaling. Does that mean she's always polluting? It's nonsense. I see Senator Sterle laughing, as indeed I know he should be, because this is absurd. Nowhere on this planet, under any government, is carbon dioxide defined as a pollutant. There are no criteria specifying it as a pollutant. It is a misrepresentation instead of data. There is no data, just a false statement. Carbon dioxide, nature's trace gas, is essential for all life on this planet. Senator Waters then went on to talk about 'megafires on a scale never seen before'. False. In the 1930s and the 1970s there were bigger fires, wider fires, and more damage. And then she said the fires were due to a deep drought. That is partially correct. But, in the past, we have had more severe droughts and we have had more severe fires. The fires and the droughts are not due to human use of hydrocarbon fuels. In fact, the drought we've just gone through—and it's still in place in some places—is confirmation, is evidence, that the weather is behaving naturally. There is natural variation. And then Senator Waters said Fraser Island 'had a massive bushfire', as it does every now and then, and—wait for it—'a 1,000-year-old tree is threatened'. Really? I know a 10,000-year-old civilisation that is being threatened globally—with no data, just false statements and fear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the Senate that my questioning of CSIRO, my holding of the CSIRO to account, has shown these things. The CSIRO has admitted to me that they have never said there is danger from carbon dioxide from human activity. Never. So why are we going through this nonsense? Secondly, the CSIRO admitted to me that today's temperatures are not unprecedented. That means we didn't cause them. There were warmer temperatures in the past. Thirdly, when they couldn't respond properly with evidence to my questions, they said they rely upon climate models. Their climate models show that they are not based on data. Their climate models are invalidated and have proven erroneous. The fact that they have to resort to them—their fabrications—means they don't have any data. We have 17 scientists from leading organisations around the world who have shown that the CSIRO is wrong and I am right that the CSIRO has no evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Waters talked about the government's role in letting the country down by not having adequate policies on climate. The government has three basic roles. The first is to protect life. There is no threat to life from current climate variability. The crippling energy threat destroying our energy sector is a threat to life. Ask anybody who is old and poor. Secondly, government has to protect property. With no data and for no reason, the government has stolen land from farmers, stolen their property rights, and that is a huge threat. The third role of government is to protect freedom. Again, there is no data, no reason; they are just putting into place arbitrary regulations and policies that have complete control over people. Then Senator Waters said we need 10 years to get climate under control. Oh really! King Canute claimed he could part the waters in the Red Sea. Senator Waters is claiming to be able to control the climate. These things come and go. This is sheer arrogance, insanity and stupidity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Al Gore claimed that the northern polar ice cap would disappear by 2013. He said that back in 2008. It is still there, as big as ever. There is a joke in which Al Gore is complaining about someone who has just made a statement that there will be no life on the planet, no polar ice caps, in five years. He says: 'Really? I've been saying that for 30 years. That's my statement!' This is absolutely stupid. And then we are told we will have 50 million climate refugees by 2010. That was said in 2005. We have had zero climate refugees, absolutely none. This is just a propaganda tool to scare people. Again, the use of propaganda confirms the lack of data and the lack of empirical scientific evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then Senator Waters talked about pure physics as her evidence—no data, no empirical scientific evidence, not even a claim of the relationship that is supposed to be underpinning this. She had no data, just false statements and fear. And then she talked about 'abundant, cheap, clean renewable energy'—her words. Let's look at that. Solar and wind are none of these things. Abundant? No. Intermittent. Unreliable. Cheap? No—the most expensive. Without subsidies, as Warren Buffett said, they're dead; they only live on subsidies. Alan Moran, the noted economist, using the government's own figures, has estimated the cost of climate subsidies and renewable energy subsidies as being $13 billion every year. That is $1,300 per household per annum in Australia. For nothing! This is on top of energy prices. And for every clean energy job there are 2.2 real jobs lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for clean: they rely upon rare earths that come from child Labor in Africa. They're talking about the Kilcoy solar panels; cadmium and selenium will leach into the soil and the waterways—into Brisbane's water supply—if that solar plant project goes ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about afterwards? What do we do with these windmills after their 15-year life? They're burying them in Wyoming right now. That's extra cost and extra pollution—real pollution. Solar panels are a real pollutant and they're now an environmental legacy. Again, there's a reason why windmills didn't last. Again, Senator Waters relies on no data, just false statements and fear. She cited nations declaring a climate emergency. Let's look at some of these. Japan is building coal-fired power stations. France relies on nuclear energy. Britain relies on French nuclear energy through an interlinked cable and also relies upon wood pellets burned in an old coal-fired power station—they cut down American forests and transport them across to Britain, using hydrocarbon fuels. And Germany is now building coal-fired power stations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then Senator Waters quoted socialist Christiana Fuegeres, who is a senior bureaucrat in the UN in charge of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change—the governing body for this nonsense. She says openly that the aim of the whole climate campaign is to convert the world to socialism and to change the economic system—change the economic system! Those are her words, not mine—again, no data, just misrepresentations and fear. That's all Senator Waters is relying upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have time to go into the motion itself; it's easily torn apart. But I will remind the chamber that 10 years ago, on 7 October 2010, I challenged Senator Waters, in a public forum that we both attended as panellists, to debate me on climate science and the corruption of climate science. She jumped to her feet faster than I've ever seen her move and said, 'I won't debate you.' In May 2016 she again refused my public request to have a debate. Four hundred and forty days ago, on Monday 9 September 2019, I challenged her again, and Senator Di Natale. But they continued to refuse to debate me and they refused to provide the evidence to the Senate—no data and no proof. There was no debate, just shouted alarm—false statements and alarm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Senate keeps making decisions without data then this Senate ceases to be the people's house of review and continues to be the circus of useless gestures—the big top of virtue signalling and the ministry of silly walks. Senator Hanson and I will continue to use the empirical scientific evidence, the hard facts, to continue to respect and restore the house of review for the people of Australia. There is no climate emergency, there is a governance emergency.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I'm a big believer in the power of civil society. By that I mean that we can often achieve so much more when local people get together to solve a problem in their own backyard, in a way that suits local needs, than we can by government intervention from afar. There are three great examples that I'd like to mention today which really show us how Queenslanders faced with a need or a problem to solve, or a way that they want to see the lives of those around them improved, are changing the face of our community. It's enough to give you goosebumps!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is Priceless House. At Priceless House, any woman facing an unexpected pregnancy can find non-judgemental and caring support. The volunteers there are midwives, nurses and other women with relevant skills who are committed to helping women at this time of vulnerability. Usually the ladies who come through the door are alone. Some of them who come through the door are in seriously troubling predicaments—facing domestic violence, homelessness, addiction or being ostracised by their family—and the ladies at Priceless House make it their mission to become another family for them. They don't just help with counselling and decision-making in this unexpected position for these vulnerable ladies; they help to connect them with pregnancy support throughout the term, arrange second-hand, but quality, supplies to help get a nursery up and running, and the pastoral care they need to emerge from pregnancy stronger and more ready for the challenging job of being a parent. I am in awe of their loving and whole-of-mother approach to care of the vulnerable. With this approach, they demonstrate something that I know they deeply believe—that all lives, mothers' and babies', from all walks of life are valuable and have something special to contribute to the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to another great Queensland organisation. Baby Give Back is a charity based in Varsity Lakes on the Gold Coast. It's the brainchild of Carly Fradgley. She started what she called a hobby of collecting preloved baby goods when her children were growing out of car seats and prams. She thought that those gently used baby items still had life in them, and wanted to make sure somebody in need could benefit from them. Carly, her sister, Mindy, and her team of volunteers believe that every baby deserves a safe start to life, so they work tirelessly to collect and safety check essential baby items for families in need. They're so committed to every baby having their needs met that they even buy essential baby items when demand is high, everything from car seats to nappies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For most expectant parents, there is a joy that comes from preparing for a new arrival: picking out the perfect cot, a new pram or the perfect teeny tiny clothes. For some new parents, though, that experience is more like agonising over whether to buy nappies or food for their child, because they simply can't afford both, or not knowing how they're going to get their child home from hospital without an installed car seat. What started for Carly as a hobby of helping to match preloved baby goods with new families has now become a full-time task for her and her team of volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was introduced to Baby Give Back by my state colleague Michael Hart, the member for Burleigh. Together, he and I recently donated a bunch of new car seats for their team. Baby Give Back have a Christmas appeal on right now. It's about helping 240 families in urgent need to have that need met between now and Christmas. So, for those listening from afar, have you got some baby goods in good nick that could use a second life, or a willingness to spend a few dollars to buy a few new items? Check out the website for Baby Give Back. Give them a google. There are 240 newborns for whom it will make all the difference. Every baby deserves a good start to life, and that starts with a safe place to sleep, to travel safely, and to be warm, dry and fed. It's easy to get emotional when you reflect about how there are some kids for whom that is not a given, but, one by one, Baby Give Back are reducing that number with the help of so many Queenslanders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to give a shout-out to the GAPDL—long acronym! That acronym stands for the Gladstone Area Promotion and Development Ltd. While that's ordinarily a group that looks after developing the tourism attractions of the Gladstone region and attracting new businesses to set up in Gladstone, it has a really interesting story in this space. A few years ago, it was noticed that there was a real need for more help for families in the region. In particular, there was a lack of opportunity for people who didn't have the parenting skills they needed to find a way to get them. When you've grown up learning how to be a good parent by observing your own parents do a pretty good job, adjusting to being a parent yourself can still be a really steep learning curve, and I'm very happy to admit to that from my own experience. But when there are people who haven't had the benefit of those good influences, through no fault of their own—through absent parents, the loss of a parent, mental health problems, addiction or the imprisonment of a parent—it's just that much harder, without a good teacher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">GAPDL saw a need. And even though it wasn't part of their usual remit, it didn't matter. They stepped into the breach. They established Gladstone Region Communities for Children, and they teach—in a way that is basically community funded—the Circle of Security parenting program, helping to break the cycle of social problems with origins in childhood by giving parents the help they need to learn to do this most important job in life well. Giving kids a secure attachment to those who care for them, a secure base from which to learn and explore the world around them and a safe haven to return to when their developmental needs and their emotional stage require it is life-changing stuff. And it's all done by a tourism promotional group that saw a need in their community. They filled it in a way that is just perfect for the community in which they are situated and is, in many ways, different to how you'd do it in any other place. It's one of those things about Queensland: it's so big and so diverse that the solutions it needs for problems are usually not one size fits all. But to those in Gladstone who had the initiative to take on this seemingly enormous and intergenerational issue one step at a time, I'd like to say a very big 'good on you'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the support of local businesses and their donations—one that pops to mind is Ron Harding from Central Queensland Tool Supplies, who I know generously supported them recently—these civil society groups are, in a way that no government ever could with a diktat from afar, changing the lives of the people in their communities, changing the face of their local areas and offering hope and assistance to those who have a real need now. And so, to each of these groups—Priceless House, Baby Give Back and Gladstone Communities for Children—thank you for all that you do. Thank you for the model of active citizenship you provide for all of us in Queensland by noticing what's going on in your area and not being afraid to step up and make a change when it's needed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I want to make a contribution in this time allotted for senators' statements to complement the statement by Senator Walsh. Senator Walsh has opened up an avenue of concern that I believe is going to continue well through the next year of parliament, and that is about the ongoing battle to maintain dignity and security in the superannuation sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put this on the record straight up: women currently retire with 47 per cent less than men; women live five years longer than men, on average; women receive only one-third of the government tax concessions on super while many men receive two-thirds; 40 per cent of older single retired women live in poverty and experience economic insecurity in retirement; 46.9 per cent of the workforce are women; 44 per cent rely on their partner's income as the main source of funds in retirement; 8.5 per cent of women between 65 and 74 still have a mortgage; the average female salary is $44,000, including part-time workers; female graduates earn $5,000 less than male graduates in the same role; and women spend, on average, five more hours per day caring for children than men do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consequently, a huge sector of the community—a productive, impossible-to-dispense-with sector of the community—is going to be hit by a brick wall of changes, driven by the alleged paragon of family values, the Hon. Scott Morrison, and the Hon. Josh Frydenberg, accompanied by his acolytes in Senator Hume and Senator Bragg, who come out every time opposing quite reasonable increases in the superannuation guarantee. But, worse than that, through their document, <span style="font-style:italic;">Your future, your super</span>, they have proposed changes which are going to impact substantially more on women than on males. I suppose that's a reflection of the composition of their party in this parliament. I suppose that's a reflection of their contribution to women in the composition of their cabinet. The fundamental difference between the Labor Party and the coalition in this parliament is that we're approaching equality of representation and the other side are not—nowhere near it!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's think about some of the changes this crew are proposing. Trustees, in their code, are obliged to take into account the best interests of superannuation recipients in retirement. Those opposite want to change it to 'the best financial interests'. How is it in the financial interest of super members to have $36 billion taken out of their accounts? Thirty-six billion dollars less means a considerable sum less in retirement. It was an expedient measure driven by a government that sought to put some money into the economy. I don't say that those who took the money out didn't do it based on prudent advice. But there was no checking by the ATO and others that people met the criteria for taking it out. The ATO don't even check that employers put the money in properly. It's been revealed at Senate estimates and at many inquiries that the ATO don't even chase up unpaid super in people's accounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a very low-road reputation on super. I predict that we will win most of the debate on this matter in this chamber. I think Senator Bragg has an unenviable quinella. I am a racing man; I do have a punt. He was wrong on the banking royal commission—he admits it—and he was wrong on FOFA. Don't worry, Senator Bragg, the trifecta is coming! You're wrong on super. You're wrong and you're deceitful, and your totally abhorrent views on super will not be successful. What you're doing is disenfranchising people who don't have the opportunity to make high wages, who don't have the opportunity to make significant after-tax contributions to super. You are disenfranchising people who will eke out an existence supplemented by the pension or—the other way around—who will have a small lump sum to go into retirement in some sort of comfort and then eke out an existence on the pension. You're trying to destroy something that is great about Australia—a $3 trillion pool of superannuation. You're trying to make out that that's a disgrace. You point to $30 billion worth of fees—one per cent of the entire pool that is paid out in fees. And efficiencies will be driven in that area. But you're doing it in a way that will disenfranchise women more than anybody else. Women, more than anybody else, will pay the price for your abhorrent views in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That paragon of family values, right at the top of the tree, the Hon. Scott Morrison, is driving a campaign, ably assisted by the Hon. Josh Frydenberg and doubly ably assisted by Senator Hume and Senator Bragg. It is an absolute disgrace. But keep going, because we on this side believe in fairness and equity for all Australians, for those who don't earn $450 in a month and don't have any superannuation paid in. We want a taxation office that says to an employer: 'Guess what? If you don't pay your tax, there's going to be a penalty.' We want an ATO that says, 'You can't withdraw your money in an incorrect manner.' That is what we want, instead of opening a slush fund of $36 billion, which I believe will predominantly impact unfairly on the retirement incomes of women. If you're in a family and you've got two accounts and someone's got $150,000 and someone's got $20,000, which one are you going to close? Which one are you going to take the money out of? Your views in this area are going to come back and haunt you, because we will win many, many votes in this area and you will lose many, many votes in this area, because your views are abhorrent.</span>

Can the minister confirm that the Morrison government has spent $500 million less on bushfire recovery than it has announced and has failed to spend a single cent from its $4 billion Emergency Response Fund on resilience or mitigation works? Why is the Morrison government failing to deliver to help Australians recover and prepare for bushfires?</span>

One of those conditions is that all other sources of funding to support bushfire recovery have to be expended before that particular fund comes into effect, and the $200 million that is made available annually as a dividend from that fund is to support our recovery and our mitigation activities going into the future.</span>

I'm quite happy to go through and table the areas in which that $1.2 billion has been spent. But you conflate a number of issues, Senator. There is a significant difference between the bushfire recovery expenditure that has already occurred to date—through a myriad of different programs that have been administered across many, many portfolios in government—and the fund that you referred to, which refers to the money that is put aside to assist Australia in putting in place mitigation factors into the future. As I said, that requires all other forms of funding to have been expended before that one is activated.</span>

If you'd like, I'm quite happy to go through a number of programs. For instance, there is the support that's been provided to small businesses in these communities. But the fund to which you refer, senator, is a specific fund with a specific purpose with a specific set of criteria. Once all other funding has been exhausted, that fund will come into effect. That fund is in place into the future to make sure that we are always able, year after year after year, to put funding in place to assist these communities to prepare for next year. The funding that is currently being expended is from the bushfire response and recovery fund from 2020.</span>

As I have already said, the total spend on the bushfire recovery has been $1.8 billion, and this includes the National Bushfire Recovery Fund and existing support mechanisms. Senator, you know you're conflating two different funding pools because they have two different purposes. The bushfire recovery funds that have been made available to our communities that have been so devastatingly impacted by bushfires have been expended in our communities. The fund to which you refer has a completely different purpose. </span>

The Australian economy is proving to be remarkably resilient as it strengthens and comes back from the COVID-19 induced recession. Today, the national accounts for the September quarter show that the recovery of the Australian economy is well underway. The Australian economy grew by 3.3 per cent for the September quarter, the strongest quarterly growth rate since 1976, and ahead of market expectations of 2.5 per cent. It follows, of course, the COVID-19 induced seven per cent fall in the June quarter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 recession may, in a technical sense, be over, but our recovery continues and the government know that there is significant hard work ahead. We know that many Australian households and businesses continue to do it very tough, but, pleasingly, the national accounts saw strong growth in every state except Victoria for the September quarter. Growth is being driven by household consumption, which grew by 7.9 per cent for the quarter, the largest increase on record. It contributed some four per cent to real GDP growth for the quarter. Consumption was up across 17 categories, with the largest contributors being health, hotels, cafes, and restaurants—many sectors where small businesses and employees have been doing it tough. We welcome very much the fact that they are coming back strongly in terms of their recovery.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's goal has been to make sure that Australians are safe from the virus, to keep Australians in their jobs and to help them to find a job through these tough times. We have been succeeding in these goals. Over the last five months, 650,000 jobs have been created, with the effective unemployment rate down from a peak of 14.9 per cent to 7.4 per cent. The Morrison government strongly contributed to this recovery with $257 billion of direct economic support and continues to invest. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The OECD notes that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to exert a substantial toll on economies and societies, with global GDP expected to contract by 4.2 per cent in 2020, and, indeed, across other advanced economies by an average fall of 5.5 per cent. However, in Australia the OECD has improved its forecast for Australia. Previously it had forecast a 4.1 per cent contraction; it now expects that to be 3.8 per cent. This, of course, is well above and better than the forecast for those other advanced economies. It's proof, yet again, that Australia's successful management of the health crisis and the economic crisis is delivering improved and better results for Australians compared with the rest of the world facing the global pandemic.</span>

Leading up to today's GDP data, we've seen a range of different data points that show the recovery is well and truly under way. Unlike those opposite, who seem to think that this is all just a political game that they can heckle and jeckle about, ultimately these are serious issues that deal with the lives, jobs and businesses of Australians. We're pleased to see that consumer confidence is up 2.9 per cent—indeed, it's increased for 12 of the past 13 weeks. Payroll jobs data was up again this week. This is the third consecutive fortnight in which we have seen positive payroll jobs data. Building approvals rose by 3.8 per cent in October to be 14.3 per cent higher through the year. These measures are all about ensuring better job security for Australians, better prospects for Australian businesses and the recovery of Australia's economy from this global pandemic.</span>

It matters a great deal—indeed, in my answer to the previous question, I was very clear in acknowledging that there are Australian businesses and households who are still doing it tough. We know that. This is a global pandemic that Australia has faced, and we've faced it better than the rest of the world. We've faced it as a nation. We, as a government, don't take full credit by any means; we know that this has been a partnership with hardworking Australians and with Australians in business who have come through these tough times. This has been a partnership with the states and territories in terms of their responses.</span>

                  </a>  I don't know whether those opposite would rather be in any other country right now, but I tell you what most Australians know: they would rather be here, because in Australia they are safer than they would be in virtually any other country in the world. They also know that in Australia their jobs, their businesses and their livelihoods are safer than in virtually any other advanced economy around the world. That is the result of the types of policies that have been deployed across Australia, but it doesn't mean that the crisis is over. Far from that, we know very well that there are more Australians who need to get back to work and that there are Australian businesses that are still doing it tough. That's why the budget we handed down this year, our economic recovery plan, focuses on job creation and investment driving the things that will help the recovery to continue.</span>

When we went to the last election, one of the key achievements that we took to that election was the creation, across the Australian economy, of more than 1½ million jobs during the work of our first six years in government. It absolutely devastates us, as we know it devastates many, that this pandemic has created chaos for many of those jobs and the households that depend upon them. But what we do welcome is the fact that we've seen 650,000 jobs come back, recreated over the course of the last five months. This is about making sure that we do get Australians back into work and, in getting them back into work, we recreate strength in the labour market and, through that, across the wages market too.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The road ahead will be long, hard and bumpy. But the Australian economy has demonstrated its remarkable resilience …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it actually has. Today's accounts show that the Morrison government's economic plan is helping to create jobs, it is helping to boost our economic recovery and it is helping to secure Australia's future. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate said, we have now seen GDP growth in the third quarter return to positive territory, growing by 3.3 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is reinforced by the latest labour force figures for October, which show that, with a further easing of restrictions across Australia and businesses being able to reopen their doors, jobs are returning to the economy. In fact, the labour force figures for October show that labour market conditions across Australia continue to recover, with employment increasing in October by 178,800 jobs over the month. When you look at what the market expectations were versus what the employment growth actually was—178,800—it far exceeded market expectations. When you look at the breakdown of those jobs, full-time employment increased by 97,000 jobs. This is the largest monthly increase on record. Part-time employment rose by 81,800 jobs. We also saw an almost one per cent increase in the participation rate. So Australians are putting up their hands and they are saying, 'We want to go back to work.'</span>

But Australians also want to know that we are on the right track. They want to know that the policies that we, as a government, are putting in place to support them, and to support their employers in keeping their jobs open, are actually working. And they are. In fact, more than 75 per cent of those who'd lost their jobs have returned to work. That is actually a good thing for those people. Seventy-five per cent who'd lost their jobs are back at work. When you look at the last five months, around 648,500 jobs have returned to the labour market since employment fell to its lowest level in May. Pleasingly, as Senator Payne knows, almost 343,800 jobs were for women. Australians want to be given hope, and certainly the employment figures do just that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But that is because Australia entered COVID-19 from a position of economic strength. That is actually a good thing. You want to enter a pandemic from a position of economic strength, because it means that you have a chance of surviving it, and that is exactly what we are seeing happening. As we on the government side of the chamber know, governments don't create jobs; employers do—businesses do. Our role as a government is to put in place the economic policies that will help businesses keep their doors open, prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians. That is exactly what we are doing, and that's why we have our JobMaker plan. It builds on our strong economic record, empowering businesses to prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians, which is what we want them to do.</span>

Senator Griff, my understanding is—I've been advised—that the government is having, as you know, ongoing discussions with the nation's domestic airlines and has had throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue to do that, because, as you know, the aviation sector has been severely impacted by COVID-19. Both domestic and international flights are down significantly, and, unfortunately, thousands of workers in the sector have been stood down. You'd also be aware, though, that we've provided around $2.7 billion so far to support the aviation sector. This includes support to maintain minimum air services across Australia, including over 400 return flights per week to more than 120 locations, of which more than 110 are regional or remote; $120 million is being paid to airlines to support critical connections on Australia's major routes; and over $30 million has been paid to airlines to ensure essential regional air networks can be maintained.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know, though, the reality is that international borders are still closed, and, as such, the Australian government wants domestic travel to get back to normal as soon as possible. The recent challenge we've faced, though, has obviously been in relation to states and territories at times having their borders closed, sometimes at very short notice. But, encouragingly, both Queensland and, indeed, my home state of Western Australia have recently announced the opening of their borders to Victoria and New South Wales. We are now seeing, as a direct response to that, increased or strong demand for flights returning already. But we will continue to talk with the aviation sector— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

An example I can give is from yesterday, as to a flight to Adelaide. A number of flights were actually cancelled, in what appeared to be a move to maximise loadings and profits for another flight that ended up being four times the price of the original. What are you doing in relation to the price gouging that some airlines appear to be undertaking?</span>

The airlines are contractually required to provide commercially competitive ticket pricing on subsidised flights. The government support seeks to maintain a level of competitive tension in the domestic aviation market—for example, by supporting both Qantas and Virgin on the same route. Under the Domestic Aviation Network Support program, government assistance reduces in direct proportion to the revenue airlines earn on supported flights, and, under the contracts, airlines provide weekly data in arrears at the time of invoicing to access commerciality triggers to enable the department to confirm if commerciality triggers actually apply.</span>

The government of which we are members, the Morrison-McCormack government, understands how extraordinarily important the resources sector is and the role that it plays in creating jobs and investment in Australia, particularly in regional Australia. The sector is an absolutely key pillar of our economic prosperity, and it will be absolutely crucial in ensuring that Australia's economic recovery is strong. In fact, in August this year, the resources industry was employing over 247,000 Australians. That's an increase of more than 6,000 since February. We know the importance of giving regional Australia the best opportunity, and we will continue to back the resources sector as one of the largest and most important employers in Australia.</span>

The latest report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Resources and energy major projects: 2020 </span>report, identified a really bright future for many of our major resources and energy projects, including a 19 per cent increase from last year in a number of major resources and energy projects under development currently in Australia.

That's why, in the 2020-21 budget, the Morrison-McCormack government invested $125 million to extend the Exploring for the Future program for another four years. And there was $52.9 million for the Gas-fired Recovery package. This investment is absolutely crucial for Australia's economy, especially now that our internal borders are starting to open up. These measures attract investment, they deliver jobs and they secure a reliable, low-cost energy pipeline for manufacturers, industries and households.</span>

But, Senator Siewert, we recognise that we have been through a once-in-a-hundred-year crisis and that the impact of that crisis has been severe across our entire economy. That's why we put in place the coronavirus supplement and a raft of other measures to support Australians through this crisis.</span>

Senator Siewert would know very clearly that the absolute priority and policy of this government is to make sure that we work with the Australian economy and with the Australian public—with all Australians—to make sure that we have a strong economy which creates jobs so that those people who find themselves in a situation where they don't have employment have jobs created so they're able to get to work.</span>

But the most important thing we can do is support Australians through the appropriate policy settings that we have put in place through this once-in-a-century pandemic to make sure that that ongoing support reflects a very clear balance between supporting Australians and recognising the shallow jobs market. At the same time, we need to make sure we put in place the right incentives for Australians to re-engage with the workforce. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I obviously don't accept the premise of her question. The government has worked very hard this year to make sure we put additional supports in place for all Australians. Those supports remain in place today and they will remain in place after Christmas—into the first three months of 2021. We will continue to monitor the situation to make sure we balance the supports that have been put in place to make sure Australians are supported through this pandemic. Senator Siewert would be well aware that the government has always been committed to making sure our welfare system is targeted so that we are providing the level of support to make sure individuals get the support they need to recognise their individual circumstances. I reject the premise of the question you first asked, Senator Siewert. This government remains committed to supporting all Australians.</span>

As you rightly point out, Senator Siewert, people who find themselves without work are in a more difficult situation and have lower levels of personal wellbeing than those who are working. That is why we are absolutely committed to making sure we put job creation absolutely at the top of our agenda and, at the same time, provide levels of support to support all Australians through this pandemic. On 16 November the government released the Productivity Commission report you've referred to. We will very carefully consult with stakeholders in relation to the findings in that report. We will deliver a very comprehensive whole-of-government mental health and suicide prevention response to that report in the coming months.</span>

South Australia produces half of Australia's wine, and 80 per cent of our wine is exported. Exports to China have reached $1.2 billion annually. What is the government's estimate of the prospective losses to the Australian wine industry, and specifically to South Australia, as a result of China's punitive tariff decision and the effective exclusion of Australian wine from the Chinese market? How much damage will China's tariff do? What is the likely time frame for any Australian complaint to the World Trade Organization about China's outrageous actions? Is it not the case that the WTO's dispute resolution process could take well over a year and likely much longer?</span>

Obviously Australia is extraordinarily disappointed by the actions of China to seek to impose a provisional anti-dumping measure—a tariff of between 107 and 212 per cent. The Australian government is absolutely unaware of any evidence that Australian wine exporters have dumped their products in the Chinese market and we acknowledge that Australian exporters have worked very, very hard to establish themselves in that market. However, right now the most important priority of the government is to work with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce for the 10-day period in which we are currently allowed to make submissions in writing by the affected parties in response to this announcement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also understand that today—I'm not sure whether they have or they're about to—the minister for agriculture, along with Senator Birmingham, the minister for trade, will be meeting with the Chief Executive of Australian Grape &amp; Wine, Tony Battaglene, to discuss with him the implications of this particular action, should it be successful, on the Australian wine industry. There is no doubt, Senator Patrick, that, should this action be successful and these provisional duties be brought into place, the impact on our home state will be significant. As you would be aware, $800 million of the $1.07 billion worth of wine exported to China comes out of our home state of South Australia. So we will continue to work with the industry to assess the impact should this go ahead, but our first priority must be to make sure that it doesn't happen in the first place, and we have a very short time frame in which to make that happen, with the 10 days we have in which to make written submissions.</span>

I wasn't in the meetings that the trade minister and the agriculture minister had, or are having, with the wine industry today, where I'm sure they will be discussing a number of things by which the Australian government can support the Australian wine industry through these particularly difficult times. One thing I can tell you is that the government has, over recent months and years, worked to open up other trade market opportunities—for instance, through the agricultural counsellors who have been put in place in many of our highly profitable other trade markets. I believe we now have 22 trade counsellors that are working through the ASEAN countries to make sure that we continue to successfully build markets and get favourable trading arrangements with these emerging markets.</span>

Obviously, I am not in a position to come in here and advise you of policy of which I am unaware. But one thing I absolutely can tell you, Senator Patrick, is that the Australian government has backed and will continue to back our exporters. For instance, the government has a track record of standing up for our wine exporters. We took Canada to the World Trade Organization. Canada agreed, back in July this year, to remove its tax and sales restrictions discriminating against Australian wine, following Australia's initiation of a World Trade Organization dispute. It is an example where we have demonstrated our willingness to back our exporters, and our wine exporters particularly. We will make sure in this particular instance that we work through all options to make sure that we can push back against this antidumping claim made by China, so that our exporters are not unfairly dealt with.</span>

But thank you very much. You raise a very important issue. Aerial firefighting plays an extraordinarily important role in protecting communities' essential infrastructure and providing the wider support that our bushfire fighters on the ground so importantly need. Also, the National Aerial Firefighting Centre is an effective method for the government to deliver critical emergency management capacity. I know that the commissioners and the chief fire officers within each jurisdiction work very closely with that centre to determine the type and location of aerial firefighting assets on the basis of the assessed bushfire risk.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This collaborative approach is absolutely essential right now as we enter into the bushfire season. We remain absolutely committed to supporting this important emergency management capability and we know that our aerial firefighters are integral to the safety of our communities as they fight fires and deliver important resources when and wherever a disaster might strike. In fact, we announced a permanent increase in funding of $11 million a year to the centre, taking the annual contributions to in excess of $25 million. Additionally, the government supplements the operating costs of aircraft through the disaster recovery funding arrangements with the states and territories.</span>

I think to a large extent I answered your question in the first part of my answer—that is, the Australian government is absolutely committed to making sure we have a sovereign aerial firefighting capability that is appropriate for the conditions we find. We have a very comprehensive response to bushfires. We continue to work across jurisdictions, acknowledging Senator Reynolds and the huge role that the military played in supporting Australians and our firefighters during the terrible bushfires at the end of 2019 and into 2020. We remain absolutely committed to doing that. We also remain committed to making sure that a broad range of support is put in place, whether that be making sure that we support telecommunications or making sure that we've got wildfire protections in place. In terms of our aerial firefighting capability, we are absolutely committed to providing and working with the states to include this— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I would refute the context of the question that you have just put forward, because I don't believe that the Australian government is doing what you've accused it of doing. I believe the Australian government is absolutely supporting the Australian public by making sure that we put in the capabilities to ensure that we keep Australians safe. We put those things in place last year through some of the most devastating bushfires this country has ever seen. We remain committed to working with the states and territories—</span>

I also thank him for his enduring support for our nation's security. Malicious cyberactivity is increasing in our nation in its frequency, in its scale and also in its sophistication. In the last financial year alone, the Australian Cyber Security Centre had over 60,000 reported cases of cybercrime. Today, there are over two million small to medium businesses here in Australia and their cyber-resilience is absolutely critical to our post-COVID-19 recovery. That's why, today, I launched a new national cybersecurity campaign for small businesses. This new campaign will empower Australians to take responsibility for their online security. Led by the Australian Cyber Security Centre, it will provide regular, easy-to-follow advice for all Australians on how to protect themselves. The campaign will particularly target the major cybersecurity threats that face Australian businesses. It starts with the first publication on ransomware. This campaign will be as agile as the cybercriminals that we seek to defeat.</span>

Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility for all Australians.

Australians need to be aware that it is not just large businesses that are being targeted by cybercriminals. Small and medium enterprises are also being targeted. Ransomware attacks now pose the highest cybersecurity threat to Australian small businesses. Over the last 12 months the Australian Cyber Security Centre has seen a 50 per cent increase in ransomware attacks. This week the government, through the Australian Cyber Security Centre, has launched two new guides on ransomware. These guides provide very practical and easily implementable advice for Australian businesses. They advise businesses how to protect themselves, how to respond if they are subject to a ransomware attack and also how to recover from these attacks. I urge all Australian businesses to visit cyber.gov.au to download these guides.</span>

Globally, malicious cyberactors are taking advantage, quite shamelessly and cruelly, of the COVID-19 pandemic. This government has continued to strike back against highly organised and highly sophisticated foreign cybercriminals. We've done this through an offensive operation led by the Australian Signals Directorate. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Signals Directorate has collaborated with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and the Australian Federal Police to use their offensive cybercapabilities to attack cybercriminals' tools and disrupt their business models. These criminals are simply ruthless, and they are attacking and targeting Australians by tricking victims into downloading advanced criminal malware onto their mobile devices. This ASD led operation has protected hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians from these crimes. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, across Australia, we're seeing dozens of bushfires. There are some happening right now in my home state of Queensland, in particular on the World Heritage listed Fraser Island. There are also fires in New South Wales and other states. It's another reminder already that we are in the natural disaster season.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as those fires happening in some parts of the country right now, it's also coming to the time of the first anniversary, in so many parts of Australia, of the terrible Black Summer fires we saw last year. I'll give one example that I don't think anyone will forget: the town of Cobargo, devastated by fires, the scene of those embarrassing visits by the Prime Minister after he came back from Hawaii, forcing people to shake his hand and then scurrying off once they actually had something to say to him. Unfortunately, we still see residents and business owners in towns like Cobargo being left behind by this government, nearly a year after they experienced the devastating bushfires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only this week on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> program, which was, among other things, looking at how people are coping after the bushfires, Cobargo resident Graham said, 'We've been politically and practically abandoned.' That's how bushfire victims feel one year on from the bushfires around which they were abandoned at the time by the Prime Minister and his government. The National Bushfire Recovery Fund is one example of that. This was the Prime Minister's great response to the bushfires when he pledged that he would spend $2 billion on a National Bushfire Recovery Fund to assist survivors of the bushfires recover. Of course, we discovered at Senate estimates earlier this year that this was in fact a notional fund. It's a fund that didn't really exist and would only ever reach $2 billion if it really had to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we've seen that the government is claiming to have spent $1.2 billion of that Bushfire Recovery Fund, but again at estimates we uncovered that this was another example of the government making claims that just don't stand up to scrutiny. In fact, the amount that the government claims to have spent from the Bushfire Recovery Fund includes half a billion dollars that it has yet to distribute to the states. I don't know why it's so important for this government to misrepresent what it's actually doing for bushfire victims. Why not just admit that what you've actually spent is $700 million from the fund and that you will be spending another $500 million, rather than going out there and claiming to have spent $1.2 billion when it's actually a lot less? This is why bushfire survivors find it so hard to trust this government and why they feel so abandoned and left behind by this government—it's because, for all the promises that the government have made to look after people, they continue to be left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also seeing this government not only failing to respond properly in terms of the recovery from last year's bushfires but also, again, demonstrating that they are not prepared for the coming disaster season. Today I accompanied the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and the member for Eden-Monaro, Kristy McBain, to Braidwood, an hour and a bit away, where we met with RFS cadets who are being trained through the local high school. That community was also hit by the bushfires last year and is doing a good job of recovering. By training up young people to assist in the RFS they're showing that they're preparing for what lies ahead this summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, their effort is not being matched by their federal government. To give just one example, 18 months ago, in last year's federal budget, the government announced the $4 billion Emergency Response Fund. We worked with the government last year to get the legislation through to establish that fund, and, here we are, 18 months after it was announced, while fires are already happening around Queensland and New South Wales—and not a single cent has been spent from that Emergency Response Fund. We are already seeing fires in this country, we know from the Bureau of Meteorology that we face above-normal numbers of cyclones and floods this year because of La Nina, and yet the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, has a $4 billion fund sitting in a bank account that was established to help communities prepare for disasters but that he hasn't spent a cent from! The answer we always get from the government is that 'there are other funds available to assist people'. If that's the case, why are people still living in caravans in Cobargo? Why are people in Bega and Cobargo crowdfunding to build evacuation centres and toilet blocks? The fact is, this government isn't delivering on its announcements yet again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I would particularly like to hear from those opposite who have been involved in active firefighting; I have been, down on the farm and on my parents' property, and I know my good friend Jim Molan is actively involved in his local fire service. I would genuinely like to speak to those opposite who have been involved, because I think there is a really important level of knowledge to be gained from actually experiencing a fire front. It's truly an extraordinarily frightening and confronting experience. My father and I were protecting our property one day from a fire, and the pump stopped working literally 30 seconds before the bush fire brigade arrived. The gutters of our house were on fire. We both certainly know what it means to be in a dangerous fire situation. I say I'd like to speak to those opposite who have experienced that because I cannot believe that those opposite are politicising disaster preparedness in the way that they are here today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aerial firefighting capacity is not a silver bullet. Anyone who has been involved in firefighting and who's been involved on the ground in a bushfire zone, knows that, yes, it has a role to play but it is in no way a silver bullet that can replace people on the ground. When my father was a young man, there were thousands of people involved from the forestry industry where I grew up, down in Pemberton—thousands of mill workers. In fact, the Warren district at that point was a safe Labor seat, because the mill in town employed hundreds, thousands, of blue-collar workers. But when the Labor Party walked away from that industry, they walked away from those workers, and the bush lost an extraordinary capacity for on-the-ground firefighting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, society has changed. We've developed the peri-urban areas. In the last decade something like 300,000 new homes have been built in the peri-urban areas of Australia—that is, completely surrounded, in most cases, by reasonably dense bush. That has created an environment where the risk of disasters of this sort, including climatic conditions, is having a massive impact. But the idea that this is something we should politicise or that this is something that in any way we should seek to make political points out of—it's very sad that the Labor Party has, quite frankly, stooped this low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Emergency Response Fund—as some of my colleagues have noted in disorderly interjections—was voted for by the Australian Labor Party. It cannot be accessed until advice is received that it is required and that all other funding sources have been depleted. That is its purpose. That is what those opposite and those on this side voted for. But we do provide significant funding for disaster preparedness through other means—$130 million in Commonwealth funds under the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework, $37 million on telecommunications resilience. Again, we know how important it is if you can't contact your local fire brigade, your local bushfire service or your local emergency services in those situations. Being on your own in those circumstances is extraordinarily risky. There's $8 million to work with the states and territories to develop a public service mobile broadband capacity, $2 million for the emergency alert capacity. There's an enduring research capability with $88 million for a new world-class disaster research centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 30 seconds I have remaining, we also have to make sure that we listen to those who have the experience. Roger Underwood, from Western Australia, was a good friend of my fathers and spent a lot of time in the south-west forest of WA. He knew what it was like to fight fires on the ground. The people in this place have an obligation to listen to people like Roger Underwood, people like Rick Sneeuwjagt, people who have the experience of fighting these sorts of fires on the ground.</span>

                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  Whilst I'm tempted to take Senator Brockman's opportunity to talk about my bush firefighting experience, I fear that it would be self-incriminating if I were to tell that story, so I might leave that one for another day. What I do want to talk about is the economy. There was some welcome news that we saw today, which is encouraging. I want to actually go to the substance of the way this government deals with it. What we saw, and we saw it from the press conference from the Treasury and we saw it in this chamber today as well, is how quick they are to get out there and take credit. As soon as they are able to they get out there and take credit. We saw evidence of that from the question from Senator Gallagher today to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Whilst there's some welcome news, there is still overwhelming evidence about how difficult it is for families out there as they try to recover from the COVID pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think you have to look at how the government operates, because at the end of the day this actually goes to the way that they treat Australians and Australian families. We see it today with the economy. We also saw it earlier this year. As we've also highlighted through question time today, we saw it with their response to bushfires. We have also seen it in how they have responded to sports rorts—let alone robodebt, where there's a lack of accountability. There is a lack of answering the questions that we put to them, trying to hold this government to account so that Australian families can understand how they are responding to these challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that they avoid accountability. They go out of their way, whether it's by lodging PII claims, by not answering questions, by failing to front up and actually level with the Australian people. At the end of the day, when you're in government there is a component of that where you have to be up-front with the Australian people, you actually have to be prepared to answer some of those tough challenges. It's from the Prime Minister down. He takes the lead role in this. He's always there ready to announce the good news but never actually to be up-front with the Australian people or say, 'We got this wrong,' like he should have done at the start of the year with the bushfires and like they should have done in response to sports rorts. They should've been up-front with the Australian people and said: 'We've got this wrong. We're going to fix it up. We're going to fund those clubs that missed out.' We have seen it with the bushfires again, a failure—who could not be forced into action after what they saw at the start of this year? We're still seeing it today with those communities that are suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen it in response to international events. All Australians were relieved when Kylie Moore-Gilbert was released. The foreign minister was all over it. She was all through the media talking about it. Yet this week we've got a massive diplomatic incident with our biggest trading partner and the foreign minister has not fronted the media once. The shadow foreign minister has, has been prepared to get out and talk about Australia's interests in this regard, but the foreign minister has been silent. They were all over the news the other week about Kylie Moore-Gilbert being released, but there's a failure to actually show leadership. The member for Dawson, George Christensen, has done more media about this than the foreign minister. This is our biggest trading partner. This is going to cost jobs. This is going to have a negative impact on the economy and the foreign minister is silent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what we get from this government. When there's some good news, the minister and others will be out there taking credit, but when there's the tough stuff to deal with—whether it's the government's response to bushfires, taking responsibility for what happened with sports rorts or the outrageous behaviour with robodebt—the government is missing in action. Time and again this is what we see from them. We welcome the fact that there is some encouraging news on the economic front, but we know that the reality for Australians and for Australian families is that things are going to be extremely difficult over the next 12 months. We know that early next year this government will withdraw its support for those people who can't afford to be without that support. But that is what this government will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They don't make the hard decisions or the tough decisions and level with the Australian people. They don't have a Prime Minister who is prepared to talk in the national interest. For this Prime Minister, there is only one interest, and that's himself. That is all he thinks about. He never thinks about the national interest, he never thinks about what's good for Australians, he only thinks about himself. There is no better example of that than the fact that, when he quarantined, he quarantined with his photographer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I've been in this place for coming up to 18 months and it's been a great honour to serve the great people of Western Australia. But I think I can count on the fingers of one hand how many times I've heard serious and legitimate questions from those opposite. Their questions are covered in smear and innuendo; very few of their questions go to a point of significance for the Australian people. Instead, time and again we see those opposite putting spin on particular topics and subjects to score a political point. I think there is nothing more shameful than coming into this place and trying to score a political point on something that is very serious for the people of this nation, particularly those who live in bushfire-prone areas. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This line of attack is typical of Labor. They think that blindly committing to spend money can solve a problem, with flashy promises and attack lines that really have very little substance. Labor's record on firefighting and land management is actually not very good. Senator Brockman spoke about the importance of understanding what's involved in dealing with bushfires and making sure that we are prepared for bushfires, but Labor members and their friends in the Greens continually hamstring attempts to perform adequate back-burning. We're seeing this in states controlled by Labor and where there's a real Greens influence. In 2015 and 2016, we saw disgraceful attempts by unions to unionise the volunteers of the CFA. That demonstrates that Labor sees bushfire fighters as just another political opportunity to boost union membership. Labor's record on politicising disaster relief is longer and stronger than their history of disaster management.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the remaining time that I have, I want to give some reassurance to the Australian people of what this government is actually doing. We accept that the primary role in dealing with bushfires and bushfire management on the ground is played by state governments, and the Commonwealth government doesn't want to interfere with that at all but, rather, provide the necessary support and resources to assist. That can be done in many ways. One way is through the Defence Force. This year we're going to ensure that the ADF is poised to respond as quickly and efficiently as possible. The government has streamlined and simplified its processes for states and territories to receive that support. We've set up joint task forces for each state and territory. We've exercised and validated Reserve call-out processes, and we've conducted response planning exercises with the states and territories and with Australian government agencies, including the EMA and Services Australia. We've streamlined these processes so that we can act quickly when called upon by the states to ensure that that support is there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other things this government is doing. I haven't got time, in the 14 seconds I have left, to cover them, but I will say that Services Australia stands ready. We're ready to deal with any outbreak and of course to deal with people who require assistance from the Commonwealth government through services and funding, and that's there— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  Today we've heard Senator Birmingham crowing about the state of the economy, literally shouting in this chamber about the government's achievements, when we know people are struggling to get back on their feet, when we know people are crying out for a big and bold jobs plan, when we know people want a big-picture plan of hope for their future, not slogans like the government's 'comeback' slogan—a slogan that got a great workout in the Senate today. While I was sitting in the chamber hearing this slogan thrown around, over and over and over again—the government's comeback—I had the chance to look up the dictionary definition of the government's new favourite term, 'comeback'. And here it is: 'a return by a well-known person, especially an entertainer'. An entertainer—well, Australians do not need an entertainer-in-chief. We don't need an ad-man-in-chief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Australians need is a leader to take the country through this crisis and a leader with a plan, not a leader with a focus grouped slogan. We need a leader with a big and bold jobs plan, a plan that we are yet to see from this Prime Minister and a plan that Australians need more than ever. The Reserve Bank has said it expects unemployment to stay high and to stay above prepandemic levels until the end of 2022. So there is nothing to crow about here, while people are still struggling to get back on their feet, while people are still hurting. There is no time for slogans while 2.4 million people are unemployed or underemployed, while the unemployment queues are continuing to grow and while in this country we continue to experience record-low wages growth that began well before the pandemic under this government. And there is no time to crow and shout in this chamber about achievements whilst three million Australians are relying on JobKeeper and JobSeeker to survive. Many of these people are the very people the Morrison government is leaving behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government finds it all too easy to leave people behind. Just look at the millions who missed out on JobKeeper in the first place when they needed it the most: the casuals, the freelancers, the temporary migrants and so many more. Look at the hundreds of thousands of workers the government have just left out of their plans for the JobMaker hiring credit. Indeed, almost one million Australians aged over 35 have been left behind. Think about those Australians on JobKeeper and JobSeeker who will be left behind in just a few weeks time when their incomes will be cut while they are still struggling to get back on their feet. Their incomes will be cut despite the warnings from the OECD and despite the warnings from the Reserve Bank, the IMF and every prominent economist that you could name, who say that more needs to be done, that we need to maintain incomes and that we shouldn't be ripping support out of the economy too early. This government is leaving people behind in this recovery, just like the government is leaving behind people who have been devastated by bushfires in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's think about what Senator Ruston said today. According to the minister, 'We're committed to standing by people affected by bushfires.' I doubt that people devastated by the fires last summer—who are still waiting for support, who are still waiting for the funding to rebuild, who are crowdfunding for the things that they need to rebuild and get their lives moving again—are going to be impressed or comforted by that statement. The minister said today, 'Communities received funding immediately.' Again, I doubt that devastated communities who are still waiting for support are going to be comforted by or, indeed, to believe that answer from the minister today.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Families and Social Services (Senator Ruston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Siewert today relating to the JobSeeker Payment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to take note of Minister Ruston's answer to my question about the JobSeeker payment as it relates to the coronavirus supplement and the Productivity Commission's report on mental health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I asked the minister—and I thought it was a fairly simple question—whether it is government policy for people on the JobSeeker payment to live in poverty. The minister spent two minutes very carefully not answering the question. I would call it filibustering. So, given the evidence that is before us, I'll answer the question. Yes, it obviously is government policy that people on the JobSeeker payment live in poverty, because their actions speak louder than words. With the cut to the coronavirus supplement that has already occurred, people are now living below the poverty line. And with the changes to and the lowering of the coronavirus supplement that will come in on 1 January 2021—less than two months time—they will definitely be living in poverty. They will be dropped further into poverty. So yes—it is government policy that people on the JobSeeker payment should live in poverty. The minister also then basically didn't answer and ignored my question about all those children who will have a deprived Christmas because their parents will be very aware that they have limited money at the moment, which will be even more limited when they come to 1 January, a week after Christmas, and their payments are cut again and they will be living in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quickly touch on the Productivity Commission report, because this is very important when discussing these issues. I asked the minister, in relation to the Productivity Commission report, whether she agrees that the low rate of income support and punitive mutual obligations are making Australians' mental health worse. That's what the Productivity Commission says in their report on mental health. The minister said that they'll take their time. They're looking at the report, but they need to take some time to review the report. This was released on 16 November. But the community needs to know that the government has had that report since 30 June this year—in other words, in time for their budget in October to respond much more formally and strongly than it did in the commitments they made. While the commitments made in October are of course welcome, they are piecemeal and they are not done in response to the Productivity Commission report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But how does this affect jobseekers, and those on income support particularly? The Productivity Commission report found that the mutual obligations requirements and our income support system negatively impact and aggravate the symptoms and increase the distress of those with poor mental health. The system itself is hurting people, which is why I asked the minister that question. Our income support system and the punitive approach to mutual obligations is aggravating peoples' mental ill health. The outcomes for participants in jobactive who have mental ill health are significantly worse, with 82 per cent spending more than 12 months on the program compared with 64 per cent for the wider jobactive population. It noted the challenges that people with ongoing mental ill health face when trying to re-enter the workforce. It found that people receiving income support were more than three times more likely to have depression than those in paid employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that people who are on the JobSeeker payment and who don't have work are more likely to have mental ill health. But we have a system that then aggravates that mental ill health and, in fact, in and of itself makes them stay longer in the system—because the system is making them sicker. It's making them more unwell. The minister would not answer the question about whether she agreed with the Productivity Commission's report. This makes me deeply concerned that the government is ignoring the fact that the very system they say they've put in place to help people find work is making people more unwell. Again, according to the facts, reform is needed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill continues the Morrison Government's commitment to improve the intellectual property system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />A well-functioning IP system fosters innovation and encourages the development of new ideas. The registered designs system aims to give the one point three million people working in design intensive industries the confidence to create new and innovative products. This Bill will improve the registered designs system to support this important sector, estimated to contribute 68 billion dollars annually to the economy, or more than three and a half per cent of our GDP. This Bill is just the first stage of the Government's ongoing program of designs reform, with more improvements to come after further consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill responds to a report by the former Advisory Council on IP. The report considered the effectiveness of the designs system in stimulating innovation, and its impact on economic growth. The government has consulted extensively on how to put the report's recommendations into effect and has listened closely to the views of stakeholders. As a result, the Bill's measures are broadly supported, and the government is confident that the proposals strike the right balance between the needs of designers, third parties and the broader public. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill provides more flexibility for designers during the early stages of seeking design protection. It clarifies and simplifies the designs system. This in turn delivers timely benefits for designers affected by COVID-19, improving confidence and certainty to invest in our design economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the Designs Act 2003 to implement a grace period, or a safety net, to protect designers. At present, if a designer publicly discloses a design before applying for protection, they cannot get IP rights. The grace period will give designers 12 months to apply for protection after publicly using their design. This will help prevent designers losing out on valuable rights due to accident or a lack of experience with the system. The grace period also aligns Australia with many of our major trading partners, making it easier for our designers to seek protection overseas, and encouraging international designers to bring their work to Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian businesses who have licensed exclusive rights for a design will now be able to bring infringement action, without needing to rely on the owner. When an exclusive licence design right is granted, it is often because the owner is based overseas. An overseas owner may not be interested in taking infringement action in Australia. This amendment ensures that exclusive licensees can enforce the rights they paid for, as is already the case for patents, trade marks and plant breeder's rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also simplifies the registration process for designers and reduces red tape. It will remove the rarely used option to publish a design application without registration. It will also make requests for registration automatic, after a fixed period, unless the designer indicates otherwise. As nearly all design applicants register their design rights, this change will streamline the registration process, reducing red tape, saving designers time and hassle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To further streamline registration, the formal requirements for filing a design application will be moved out of the Designs Regulations and into a non-legislative instrument, made by the Registrar of Designs at IP Australia. This will ensure that the requirements can be amended to keep up with changing technology and commercial practice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As well as delivering benefits for designers, the Bill will also implement safeguards to protect third parties in the design sector who are operating in good faith. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A prior use exemption to the infringement of designs will be created. This will safeguard third parties that start using a disclosed design during the grace period introduced by this Bill. This exemption protects businesses who have invested in a publicly disclosed design during the grace period, when they cannot know if the designer intends to seek IP protection. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also extend the current innocent infringer defence so that relief is available from any time after the design's filing date. This reduces the risk of a design right being innocently infringed in the six months between its filing date and registration. During this time there may be no way to know that the design may be protected, as it is not yet published. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Bill also makes a range of smaller technical corrections and improvements to the designs system. These include a change so that registrations should be revoked if acts of fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation were committed during the certification of a design. Other amendments will improve procedural fairness where an applicant has made a mistake about the ownership of a design and will clarify some ambiguities in the Designs Act to reduce legal uncertainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am very pleased to introduce this Bill, which will enhance our IP system and support the design sector which contributes so much to our economy, and to our quality of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</span>

                  </a>  Before the coronavirus pandemic the government had reduced the gender pay gap to the lowest level on record. In December 2018, the government legislated five days unpaid family and domestic violence leave as the new minimum entitlement for employees in the National Employment Standards. On 6 October 2020, the government released the 2020 Women's Economic Security Statement. In addition to significant community-wide measures in the budget, this $240.4 million package provides targeted support for women to strengthen their employment opportunities, paid participation and flexibility. There's more work to do and the government is committed to improving women's economic security and closing the gender pay gap.</span>

Firefighting is the responsibility of state and territory governments. The appropriate aerial firefighting fleet for each jurisdiction is decided by operational experts, not by federal politicians. Nevertheless the federal government will continue to support Australian industry to grow in this area. At present 128 of 158 aircraft contracted are Australian owned and operated. There is an ongoing federal government commitment of more than $25 million a year to support this capability. The government will continue to work with states and territories and rely on the expert advice of their commissioners.</span>

                  </a>  The government is committed to helping senior Australians remain in their own homes for longer, and that's why we have invested in home care at every opportunity since the 2018-19 budget, with additional funding for over 73,000 packages, at a cost of $4.6 billion. The number of packages has increased from 60,308 under Labor in 2012-13 to 185,597 in 2020-21—under this government, an increase of 208 per cent in the number of packages. Over the same period, funding will increase by 302 per cent due to the growth in the number of high-level packages. Labor went to the last election with $387 billion of new taxes and offered no additional funding for home-care packages. Home care wasn't even mentioned in their budget reply speech.</span>

                  </a>  One Nation supports this motion. One Nation and the Greens may well expect different outcomes from a royal commission, yet there can be only one set of facts and a royal commission will decide those facts. We expect a royal commission to find that the level of dishonest and illegal behaviour in the basin has allowed some people to make out like bandits while family farmers struggle. We expect a finding that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan works best for entities that have strong close links to the National Party in New South Wales. The plan will be seen to be destroying the productive capacity of one of the world's richest agricultural areas, destroying rural communities and transferring wealth from everyday Australians to large corporates. We expect that the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office will be found responsible for environmental damage across the basin and the Coorong. It's time to eliminate the bad actors from the plan so that hardworking Australian farmers can return to growing food and fibre for the world whilst protecting the natural environment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Over the last few decades, Tasmania has experienced a long-term drying trend that has been characterised by a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in cool seasonal rainfall. An upward trend in bushfire occurrence has also been occurring since the 1930s. The total area burned has tripled since the 1960s. In 2015, the state had its driest-ever spring on record, which goes back for the last 140 years, and the hottest October on record, prompting an early start to the fire permit period. In 2016, a total of 229 vegetation fires were recorded from 13 January to 15 March, burning a total area of 124,742 hectares with a combined perimeter of 1,260 kilometres in largely remote, rugged and inaccessible areas. About 20,125 hectares, or 1.27 per cent, of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area was affected by these fires, including about 1,466 hectares, or 1.8 per cent, of threatened and sensitive vegetation communities, some of which may not ever recover. Other sensitive areas that were also affected by the fires include Aboriginal and historic heritage areas. In 2019, almost all of Tasmania recorded accumulated monthly forest fire danger indices—FFDI—in the highest 10 per cent of historical values for December 2019, and much of the eastern half of the state recorded its highest ever December forest fire danger indices on 30 December. Several locations recorded temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s that day, with several experiencing a temperature record for December.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania registered 406 lightning strikes that ignited dozens of bushfires that day, including a fire south of Pelham, in the upper Derwent Valley, 45 kilometres north-west of Hobart. In extreme fire weather conditions, the fire spread rapidly south-east in dry forest and grasslands towards the rural communities of Elderslie and Broadmarsh. Professor David MJS Bowman, a professor of pyrogeography and fire science and director of the Fire Centre Research Hub at the University of Tasmania, wrote in his submission to the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council review of the management of Tasmanian bushfires during the 2018-19 fire season:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The 2018-2019 Tasmanian bushfire season conforms to a global trend of longer duration, geographically larger, and economically, environmentally, and socially more disruptive wildfire events. The 2019 fire season also fitted an emerging syndrome of lightning-ignited bushfires in western Tasmania. The Tasmanian bushfire season can be understood as an expression of the 'Anthropocene', a new trajectory for the Earth System induced by anthropogenic climate change, compounded by other factors such as land use and fire regime changes. Bushfires in the Anthropocene have a trajectory that tracks away from historical norms towards more extreme events. The increased frequency of abnormal fires will significantly reduce our ability to reliably ensure clean air, supply potable water, store carbon, and conserve soils.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The emergence of 'Anthropocene bushfires' raises profound questions for fire management and community safety, and requires the development of new fire management practices to protect human life, property and infrastructure, to conserve heritage and biodiversity, to manage conservation areas and national parks, and to sustain yields from forestry landscapes and hydroelectrical catchments. Anthropocene bushfires demand a recalibration of socio-political expectations around the capacity, effectiveness and financial costs of firefighting and fire prevention approaches, methods and practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's just in Tasmania, and just in the last 14 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia-wide, this last bushfire season was a horror one. The stories are still very raw: 33 lives lost; thousands of homes destroyed; many families still without proper shelter; hundreds of businesses destroyed; natural values gone, many forever; and whole species of native Australian flora and fauna most likely wiped out. Some of them will never recover. Over 17 million hectares were burned across New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, the ACT, Western Australia and South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the government were unprepared last bushfire season; it was quite evident. And the consequences were disastrous. To take just one example from the last catastrophic bushfire season: the use of the Australian defence forces. The Prime Minister's failures around defence were some of the most public. Let's not forget when the Prime Minister posted a polished video advertising that the government were deploying defence reservists to assist in bushfire areas. Unfortunately, he prioritised his shiny announcement video over informing Shane Fitzsimmons, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner, who found out about the massive influx of resources through the media. Mr Fitzsimmons said of the stunt:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All I can say is I wasn't aware of it, I found out about it via the media reports … It is fair to say it was disappointing and some surprise to hear about these things through public announcements. In the middle of what was one of our worst days this season with the second-highest number of concurrent emergency warning fires ever in the history of NSW.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the aerial firefighting capacity. For years leading up to the last bushfire season, the National Aerial Firefighting Centre pleaded with the federal government to increase their annual funding, warning that bushfire seasons were only getting more intense. For years they were ignored, until last season when, finally, funding arrived. It came months after the bushfires had already begun. The federal government then announced the same funding three times—because we all know they love announcements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can appreciate that the government is taking some action to address their failures from last bushfire season—what happened last year can never, ever be allowed to happen again—but it's simply not enough. Unfortunately, we also know that the government are, once again, putting announcements over delivery in the lead-up to this natural disaster season, which is leaving us unprepared. In recent days Australia has experienced an extreme heatwave. Dozens of fires are now burning across the country. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC has predicted above-normal fire potential across New South Wales and Western Australia throughout December 2020 until February 2021. The Bureau of Meteorology has predicted a higher than average chance of cyclones in northern Australia, predicting also that the cyclone season will start earlier and be more intense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so I come to the government's Emergency Response Fund. Eighteen months ago the Prime Minister announced a $4 billion emergency response fund designed to help fund response, recovery and resilience measures in the lead-up to and following natural disasters. Eighteen months on, and not a single cent has been spent from that fund—not a single cent; not one project amount, not one job created and not one community protected. Once again, we bear witness to this Prime Minister's apparent addiction to the photo-op but not the follow-up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements recently recommended that the federal government develop an Australian based aerial firefighting capability. It noted that Australia needs a sovereign aerial fleet, as we will not be able to continue relying on overseas support for much longer. This is, in large part, due to the fact that fire seasons globally are starting to overlap. The government have rejected this recommendation. They have said they are comfortable with the current arrangement. This was repeated by Minister Ruston in question time today in response to a question from Senator Chisholm. These arrangements have seen situations where a tiny state like Tasmania has spent $40 million on aircraft in the 2018-19 fire season alone, with contracts often having to be negotiated at the last minute and at the highest possible prices. The royal commission also noted that last year there were instances where requests for aerial assistance were not met because the aircraft were simply not available. The federal government are happy to announce the same funding three times, but they are not actually delivering the resources that Australian communities need and will continue to need over this warm summer season that, as I speak, we are starting to encounter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  On behalf of the government, I rise to address the MPI raised in the name of Senator Urquhart—but I think that, by strings, pulleys and mirrors, Senator Watt was in fact talking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To begin, I make four points. The first point is that Labor still have no idea what they're talking about in respect of the Emergency Response Fund—absolutely no idea what they're talking about—and they're ignoring the facts. The second point I make is that they have no idea about aerial firefighting—absolutely no idea at all. The third point I make is that they would not have a clue, in accordance with their MPI, what an expert is. And the fourth point I make is that we have prepared very well for the 2021 disaster season.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Senator Urquhart and Senator Watt, I am no expert. As a commercial helicopter pilot, I flew firebombing helicopter droppings for years and I put water on active fires. I did this up until a few years ago. I was also a director of the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, NAFC, as it's called, along with each and every one of the commissioners of the state and territory rural fire services, and I did that for about three years. In case Labor doesn't know, the NAFC is the organisation that leases and manages the national aerial firefighting fleet, which is funded by the Commonwealth. That funding was doubled recently and that funding is merely the start of the process for funding the national fleet of aerial firefighting aircraft. This is the fleet, of course, that Labor are trying to convince us to develop. I also gave evidence at the royal commission into the 2009 Victorian fires and I spent about 22 days at the South Coast fires, as well as six days fighting fires throughout the ACT and the Queanbeyan-Palerang local government area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike Labor's ideological climate-change activist ex-commissioners of the rural fire services, who they like to quote—and I'm very surprised that you didn't quote them this time—I would like to raise a few points and to mount an informed and practical vantage point from which to do it. Let me develop the points I made initially: you still, as a party and as individuals, have no idea—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator MOLAN:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President; I certainly will. The Labor Party still have no idea what they're voting on when they talk about the Emergency Response Fund. Those opposite would rather politicise the issue of rural firefighting by making totally wrong and illogical claims about the Emergency Response Fund. To begin with, that fund was voted for by the Labor Party. They agreed with the establishment of this fund. They should have known about it—if they don't know about it, it would be very interesting to understand why they don't know about it—because the Emergency Response Fund cannot be accessed until advice is received that money from that fund is required and all other funding sources have been depleted. That's its purpose and that's what you voted for and that's what you agreed to. The ERF allows for $150 million each financial year to fund emergency response and recovery following natural disasters and—and this is the kicker—when the government determines that existing recovery programs are insufficient to meet the scale of the response required. You agreed to it. In addition, $50 million each financial year would be available from the fund to build resilience to and to prepare for or reduce the risk of future natural disasters when the government determines that funding over and above its existing suite of arrangements is required. You voted for it and you agreed to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why haven't we accessed the $150 million that I've just listed? It's quite simple: the government has established the $2 billion Bushfire Recovery Fund. Some electorates, including the one I live in, which is represented by an ALP member, have received more than the total $150 million allowable under the ERF. So it's an interesting situation, and I guess the question is: why haven't we accessed the $50 million for mitigation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the government is already spending over $260 million in joint funding with state and territory jurisdictions on resilience and on mitigation activity. Of course the minister will always consider advice from Emergency Management Australia with regard to accessing the fund, if that is required, and, if so, what it should be spent on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we're preparing for the 2021 disaster season. I won't go into the detail at this stage; others will, and it was gone through in great detail by the minister and by others in the take note debate today. Just let me mention Defence; Services Australia; Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements changes; communications—and all in a COVID environment. And there's the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework, and, of course, a royal commission. This is what preparation is about, and this is what Labor should look at in order to understand preparation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's claim that we should be developing a national aerial firefighting fleet is totally misplaced, because the fleet's there. What a disgrace their claim is to the years of work by good people, and the financing by good governments, to produce a national aerial firefighting fleet. It's a bizarre claim. Go to a fire just about anywhere, and look up. If you see an aircraft, as you invariably will, it will be part of our national fleet. If you don't see an aircraft, it's probably because you can't see through the smoke or it's night time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In each of the years that I was a director of the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, we had a minimum of roughly 100 aircraft in the national aerial firefighting fleet, from the roughly $11 million to $12 million that was, at that time, being provided by the Commonwealth government. There are vast additional costs to this: the $11 million or $12 million just starts the leasing process, with the additional costs paid for by the states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That $11 million has now become $24 million—some development! It's a bit like Labor's claims that health and the ABC's budget have been reduced. Compared to the minimum of, roughly, 100 aircraft when I was a director, guess how many will be actually leased this year? Guess how many can be deployed? If needed, 158 aircraft, in total, are available—some development, I reckon: double the money, and a significant increase in the number of aircraft. And, of those 158 aircraft, 128 aircraft are Australian based, owned and registered. I heard Senator Watt saying something today about him having been recently briefed or being about to be briefed on aspects of this. It must have continually slipped his mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about the royal commission? We've heard Senator Urquhart quoting the royal commission's recommendations, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. On 8.2, research and evaluation: we are doing it. On 8.3, support and development: of course we're doing it. On 8.1: we have already done it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would prefer, in the few seconds I've got left, to move away from ideological climate change ex-commissioners and find some knowledgeable experts, and that is what I would recommend the Labor Party do. The Commonwealth is not and should not be going to get into aerial firefighting—except to coordinate and to fund, and that is what they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we reject entirely the proposition in today's MPI. My colleagues will further argue the case on all of those points.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I rise to speak on the MPI. I do note that Senator Urquhart talked about a long-term trend in the fire seasons, which are becoming worse and longer in duration. That is all very, very clear. I think everyone accepts that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about a static problem, a static issue, because, for as long as I can remember, looking at the aerial firefighting service, we've seen a fire season commence and then we've seen a whole bunch of very sophisticated, very capable aircraft or helicopters fly in from overseas. They fly in from overseas and they deliver this firefighting capability. That might sound good—we are leasing these aircraft rather than purchasing them—but the reality is that we have a long-term need. The other reality is that we are paying a huge premium, particularly in circumstances as the load varies for some of these aircraft. But what people need to understand is that, when you see the fire trucks racing towards the fire, there is a money truck racing towards the ports—a big truckload of taxpayers' money that is going to the ports of Australia and getting shipped off overseas. That's what's happening. The only thing that stops these trucks from rolling onto the ferries to head off overseas is that there's a Future Submarine project truck in front of them or a Watergate truck in front of them. We ship all our money off overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you what the tragedy here is. I know a number of Australian business men, people who work in the aviation industry, who would love to stand up an aerial firefighting capability. But, because the contracts that are issued by the Commonwealth are so short, if they go to their bank and say they would like to purchase a helicopter or a large aerial tanker the bank looks at them and says, 'Sorry, you have only got a two-year contract.' The Commonwealth knows that this is going to go on year after year after year. Simply extending the contract term to a reasonable time frame would permit these Australian companies to invest, with the support of banks. But no, we don't do that. We trickle out money on a short-term basis. That absolutely favours the overseas entities. They have made the investment. They have contracts in their home jurisdictions. That's a fundamental problem we need to look at. This problem could be solved. By simply changing the length of the contract terms, we would have more Australians investing in capability that resides here. And when other jurisdictions overseas are having fires we'd be sending them overseas and they would be bringing money back to Australia. That's what needs to be happening, and that's what's missing here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the responsibility of the federal government. We heard Senator Molan say that the funding comes from federal government coffers. We recognise that this is a national process, yet we hide behind the fact that we are getting the states to look at these things individually. In actual fact, we are trying to create national emergency laws. The ADF does a fantastic job weighing in on that. We have CASA. We have federal funding going to the aerial firefighting service. We need to take charge of this. We need to have a sovereign aerial firefighting capability—and it's not too hard to do. I've given the answer in my contribution today: just a tweak of a few contract terms and the problem would be solved. Australian business men and women would then stand up the capability here. Every time we issue a short-term contract for an aerial firefighting service, we are cutting off our nose to spite our face. We have to fix this.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator AYRES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  Watching Senator Molan's contribution, I finally grasped why this government has been unable to act in the interests of Australians in regional areas. He is fixed in the past, stuck in his views, unable to recognise that times have changed, that the climate has changed, that the requirements for the effective management of country have changed, that the requirements for effective firefighting have so fundamentally changed. The only response from Senator Molan is the same as the response from the Prime Minister: it's to bluster, it's to obfuscate, it's to point the finger at somebody else. It's never: 'Take charge, take responsibility and act.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many communities this week who are beginning their one-year commemoration of the bushfire season coming to them. People in Braidwood are doing that today. For people in Braidwood the fires started this week 12 months ago, but they went all the way through to February—some people having their properties burnt out multiple times. What those communities want to hear is not bluster, not ideology, not politicisation, not pointing the finger at the states, and not someone saying, 'I don't hold a hose, mate'. What they want to see is action, leadership and effective coordination from the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC outlook for December to February notes that while the east coast has experienced wetter than average conditions since last summer, normal fire conditions still persist because of long-term dryness. Half of New South Wales west of the Dividing Range will experience above-normal fire conditions this summer. While the ideal conditions for cropping and pasture growth are great news for our farmers, they create the ideal conditions in mid to late summer for very dangerous, fast-moving grassfires. The ACT and southern Monaro will experience similar conditions. Drought conditions persist in southern Western Australia. As summer progresses the South West, the Swan Coastal Plain and parts of the Wheatbelt and Esperance Plains will experience higher than normal fire potential. Nowhere in the country will experience below normal fire potential. What does 'normal' mean? Normal means that, somewhere in Australia over the coming summer, people will lose their homes to fire, businesses will be destroyed and, in the worst cases, lives will be lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The summer of 1974-75 was a normal fire season and 117 million hectares burned. The summer of 1984-85 was a normal fire season: in New South Wales alone 3½ million hectares burned, 40,000 head of sheep and cattle perished, and four people were killed. The summers of 1993-94 and also 1998-99 were normal: in all, 19 people were killed and scores of houses were burned to the ground. The summer of 2002-03 was a normal fire season: four people perished and 488 homes were burned to the ground right here in Canberra. The summer of 2008-09 was a normal fire season and 173 people died on Black Saturday, 7 February 2009. The summer of 2015-16 was a normal fire season. It was the most destructive season since 2008-09. Nine people were killed, nearly 1,000 buildings were destroyed and the fires had a catastrophic impact on Tasmania's World Heritage areas. The summer of 2013-14 was a normal season, but the alarm bells were well and truly ringing this time. It was in only October 2013 when two people died in the Blue Mountains, 208 homes were destroyed and 86,000 hectares, including World Heritage areas, burned. These are the 'normal' seasons that are becoming increasingly infrequent; above-normal fire conditions are the new normal. How much more unnecessary death and destruction will there have to be before this government gets out of its Hawaii state of mind? There is almost nobody outside the Morrison government who doesn't think that Australia should have its own national, sovereign, aerial firefighting fleet. Go to the main street of Braidwood, the pub in Cobargo, a supermarket in Taree or the Rural Fire Service in Nowra and try to find a single person who doesn't think—doesn't know!—that Scott Morrison's job isn't to produce television ads glorifying action and trying to obscure the fact that he got caught out refusing to come back from his overseas holiday while houses were being burnt out and the country needed whatever leadership he was capable of providing. And you won't find a soul who doesn't think that we need a national, sovereign aerial firefighting fleet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As in every case where the issue is about the government's responsibility to keep Australians safe, the Morrison government think it's the states' responsibility. You can hear them up in the back rows there; whenever these issues become uncomfortable they point to the states. Well, I can tell you that bushfire fighting is a national emergency, a national crisis, and it requires national leadership and a national response. Apparently for Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister, the government has no role to play other than to offer paltry, late, inadequate funding announcements with no follow-up, just spin. It took 12 hours for the Prime Minister's office to produce a slick social media ad at the height of the crisis, when the Prime Minister was trying to run from his responsibility. All of this year it's been 'clear as' that a national, sovereign air fleet is required, yet there's been no action from the Commonwealth government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry into last summer's bushfires has heard compelling evidence that a national aerial firefighting fleet must be a high priority of the national government. The Prime Minister himself gave support for the proposition when, on 4 January this year, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… what we need are water bombers that meet the technical and specific requirements of the deployment in Australia. It's not a matter of just trying to hustle up some planes from somewhere around the world. What you need is the precise asset to deal with the situation in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what he said, but they were just more empty words; there was no delivery. That's exactly what a national aerial firefighting fleet would do—it would meet our specific technical requirements; it would be there all of the time as a precise asset to deal with the situation in Australia. But, of course, all that people in regional Australia have had from this Prime Minister is empty words and avoidance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than each state and territory sourcing its own aerial firefighting fleet, it would be far more efficient and effective to build a national capability for all Australians—one that's capable of moving between the states and territories over the course of a bushfire season, one that's capable of responding early to fires that historically have been left to burn out of control in wilderness areas, because those areas are inaccessible, and have then turned into frightening, devastating fires like the one that enveloped the community of Cobargo a little less than 12 months ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government without a strategy for anything. It's a government that points the finger and bludges off the states and territories. It is never capable of doing its job and exercising its responsibility in the interests of all Australians. You lot are never capable of doing anything but pointing the finger at everybody else.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283596" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  What we heard then from Senator Ayres was a masterclass in deflection. Can I say that the behaviour of the Labor Party in the past 12 months, in their response to the bushfire crisis last year, has been quite tawdry. I well remember the worst bushfires in my lifetime, which were actually in 2009, when 180 Victorians were killed on Black Saturday, six times the number of people who died last summer—with due respect to everyone who passed away. Throughout that year, when the Rudd government was in power, there was no partisanship from the coalition to make out that it was the Rudd government's fault for the loss of those lives. Yet, this year, we've had a nonstop barrage of blame from the Labor Party, as though Scott Morrison actually lit those fires himself. That is disgusting and tawdry behaviour from politicians who represent the people and should know better. I didn't hear one solution offered by Senator Ayres in that speech. It was all smear and innuendo, which is the modus operandi of the Labor Party. Bushfires and emergency management shouldn't be used as a football to score political points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ayres' comments that the government believed that we had no role to play are an absolute insult to the Australian Army and military who participated so bravely through those bushfires in logistics, coordination, communication and helping people resettle. I really think Senator Ayres should apologise to the Australian military. The Australian government was more than willing to get the military involved, despite what Senator Ayres says. I think last year had a particular uniqueness, to the extent that the fires were widespread. There is no doubt that, when you have a national emergency like that, the Army should be involved. Talking about the fires, I notice Senator Ayres didn't mention the Black Friday of 1939 or the bushfires of the 1850s that burnt one-quarter of Victoria. So there was a bit of selective picking there as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have to get to the heart of the problem here. That, of course, is the state governments and their woeful management of their responsibilities. First of all, let's just have a look at the emergency services. Who's responsible for emergency services? The state governments are. And who's been cutting funding to emergency services for the last 20 years? It's the state governments. It doesn't help when we have retired bureaucrats, who were in that fire and emergency role in New South Wales, coming out and slagging off the government when this particular bureaucrat himself was actually head of the New South Wales Fire Brigade from 2003 to 2017. A lot of this stuff happened under his watch, and yet he was more than willing to come out when the bushfires were on and blame everyone else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing is—and this is something that's very close to my heart—the poor land management undertaken by states over the last 20 or 30 years, where farmers and, in particular, state governments have not managed their national parks properly. I know two areas in Queensland—one just near where I currently live. There are a lot of national parks there, and the parks are full of lantana. It is infested with weeds because the state governments won't get in there and clean it up. We have got a real lantana problem in our national parks in Queensland. The other thing we've got in Queensland is an actual lack of hazard reduction burning on overgrowth. We've got a big national park next to our property in Western Queensland, and it's just full of pests. Pigs come through. Goats come through. There are feral cats and wild dogs. It's not being looked after. And this is becoming more and more of a concern, because the land used by agriculture has dropped from 500 million acres in 1976 to 390 million acres today. A lot of that land is being either locked up or converted to national parks. Out in south-western Queensland, this particular part of Australia is punching way above its weight in earning carbon credits. That is, unfortunately, to the detriment of great towns like Quilpie and Charleville that are losing constituents in their shires because the Mulga is being locked up for carbon farming. That means that we're going to have more and more undergrowth, we're going to have more and more feral pests, because the farmers aren't there managing them, and we're going to have a much greater fire hazard. This is the price that is paid, as usual, by regional Queensland and the regional parts of Australia. They are the ones whose livelihoods suffer in order to fulfil the green dream. Unfortunately, one of these days, if it ever goes off out there, it's going to go on. So state governments have to do more hazard reduction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part that state governments have failed to manage properly is zoning approvals. State governments will approve housing commission blocks in both flood and fire zones. It's becoming a very bad problem. I know in Townsville in the floods last year houses were wiped out, because they were built in flood zones, and I know that a lot of houses today are unfortunately being built among the gum trees. Where I live, I go the back way through Samford Conservation Park. There are houses in there that are literally amongst the gum trees. It's like if this seat were a house and every one of these seats around it were the trees. If there's ever a fire, I don't know how these people are going to get out. Why they are allowed to live there is beyond me. It worries me a lot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth failure by state governments is the fact they have all sold their state government insurance offices. If you ever wonder why we can't get insurance in North Queensland, it's because the state government sold the State Government Insurance Office. I think we can probably all remember the SGIOs in various different states. They were there to provide insurance when the private sector wouldn't. The neoliberals in the Labor Party—and I admit we have a few in the Liberal Party, but, believe it or not, in Queensland it was all done by Labor—flogged all that off to the private sector. So insurance there is another problem as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than continue to peddle hysteria, what we need to do is look at preventive measures. Apart from the measures I have just talked about, one of the other things we need to do is stop planting eucalypt trees. It's hard to imagine, but Landcare love to go around and plant eucalypt trees. The last thing we need in this country are any more eucalypt trees. There are plenty of other Australian natives you can plant that aren't full of eucalyptus oil such that when you light a fire they are going to explode. So that is something I think we need to address. I have actually written a letter to the environment minister today, asking her to address that issue, because I think that's very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, the other thing I think we have to look at is this. The cause of that Victorian bushfire in 2009 was actually determined to be a fallen transmission line. Part of the clean, green dream is to have more renewable energy and, of course, that is going to require $100 million to be spent to build all the transmission lines to get the energy from all the disparate energy generation into the cities. More transmission lines is going to mean a much greater fire hazard because not only can you have fallen transmission lines but also those big towers are lightning conductors. So it's kind of ironic that we have the Left over here saying that we have to do something about fire while they actually want to increase the risk of fires by having more and more transmission lines. So I hope they've taken into account the cost of putting this stuff underground. I hope these transmission lines that we build for all these renewable power stations aren't going to be through towers, because that would increase the fire risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are solar panels. We know there are a lot of shoddy, dodgy imported solar panels. I have an article here where a Victorian firefighter has discussed the fact that a large number of fires today are caused by shoddy solar panels on houses. So these guys need to take a good hard look in the mirror and come up with some solutions for a change— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  One thing I do agree with Senator Rennick on is that we need to take a lot more preventive actions around fire and fire risk. The most important thing we can do is act on climate change. I was very surprised that the Liberal Party would put up a speaker like Senator Jim Molan today, who is on record as being a climate sceptic or climate denier—whatever you want to call it. It just shows why we are in such a mess. While we have a government who refuses to take climate change seriously, we are never going to solve this problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the day in 2016 that Senator McKim and I launched our double dissolution election campaign in Tasmania with a policy for the Australian government to buy water bombers. We did that because Tasmania had had a horrendous summer of fires in 2016. Senator McKim had initiated a Senate inquiry to look at those fires and the responses. It was made public knowledge in that inquiry that we couldn't get aerial water bombers when we needed them in Tasmania. In 2016, we had 145 separate fires that burned for over 63 days, destroying 126,800 hectares of mostly remote vegetation, 19,800 hectares of which was in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. In 2018-19 the bushfires burned for 100 days, destroying 210,000 hectares of mostly remote vegetation, 95,000 hectares of which was in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. These are the only forests in the world that are World Heritage protected. Some of them had vegetation that was thousands of years old that had never seen fire in their time as living, breathing plants on this planet. Both of these catastrophic fire events began with dry lightning strikes. Increasingly, rare dry lightning strikes have caused a lot of damage, not just in Tasmania, but elsewhere—another thing linked directly by the BoM to our changing climate. The year 2016 was, at the time, the hottest Tasmanian summer on record and the driest spring on record. The year 2019 was again the hottest summer on record, which eclipsed 2016, following, again, the driest spring on record. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also initiated a Senate inquiry looking at the implications of climate change on Australia's national security. We took significant evidence right around this country on why climate change is the biggest threat to this country's national security and what we needed to do about it. We had a very productive discussion on buying our own fleet of aerial water bombers. The Greens worked this policy up. We took it to the 2019 election, just like we did in 2016. And I commend Labor for adopting another Greens policy. We see it all the time, and it's great. Sometimes I think our role in here is to get the Labor Party on board, and we succeeded with that. I hope we actually now get the aerial water-bombing fleet that we so desperately need in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very quickly, what we learnt in our Senate inquiry is that, with overlapping fire seasons around the world, we cannot rely on bringing planes in from overseas. We pay an exorbitant amount of money to lease these aircraft. We have no control over when they get here or when they're used. We should have our own fleet, even if it has to be housed in the RAAF. It doesn't really matter. We need to own these. They should be owned by the Australian taxpayer. They should be on standby for Australians. And everybody has seen that. The royal commission has recently reflected that. There's no reason that we don't have our own aerial firefighting fleet, except for ideology, both an ideology around privatising and outsourcing everything in this country to the private sector to make a big buck and the ideology we have seen on display today—disgusting, almost hard to believe—from a government that actually puts up climate deniers in this chamber to talk about preparedness and readiness for extreme weather events and the risks to Australians from wildfire. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'll tell you what we're not going to get for Christmas. We're going to get the heat, but we're not going to get the protection that Australians deserve. And we're not going to get it, even though it was recommended to this government, because Mr Morrison is a phony.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He'll be there for all the photos, but when it comes to delivering the things that really matter he is a man constantly missing in action. There is plenty of announcement, but when communities across this country will be looking to the sky and praying for aerial firefighting support, there will be none because Mr Morrison decided that we didn't need it. That's the sort of Prime Minister that we have—a man who ignores the experts, a man who ignores the evidence and a man who treats Australians with contempt. I guarantee that there will be Australians this year who are standing in their street and fighting for their community, fighting to save their own houses and the houses of the community that they serve through their firefighting efforts. They will be looking skyward for a missing-in-action aerial firefighting fleet, and there can be only one person who has to be held accountable for that. It is the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard all the announcements. There was such a hope amongst Australians, after we saw the terrible fires of last summer, that when there was an announcement by our Prime Minister of $4 million for the Emergency Response Fund we all thought, 'Oh, how wonderful that our taxpayer dollars are going to help people in the community—our fellow Australians who really need the help.' But Mr Morrison hasn't spent any of that money. There's a long way between announcement and delivery with this government, and they're failing us every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the beautiful Central Coast, where I live, there was a huge effort—an heroic effort—by Rural Fire Service volunteers who fought the Three Mile fire. I was up in Mangrove Mountain recently and I know that the connectivity issues that plagued their capacity to save that community are still happening today because Mr Morrison doesn't think it's worth investing in proper connectivity for fire services and for that community. How can this Prime Minister pretend to stand up for bushfire affected communities when he cannot provide them with even the most basic infrastructure? There is a lack of telecommunications capacity in this 21st century—in the year 2020. This is putting lives at risk, the lives of both the residents of those areas that will be attacked by bushfires and those who want to serve our community by fighting the fires that will always come when those hot winds blow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years, leading up to the last bushfire season, the National Aerial Firefighting Centre has pleaded with the federal government to increase their annual funding, warning that bushfire seasons were only going to get more intense. And they were right. This is not a new request of the government, this is a longstanding request, but all this government has offered to our brave service workers is sophistry and spin. I can tell you that when Christmas comes around this year, Mr Morrison—the Prime Minister who had to hire an empathy consultant for nearly $200,000 so that he could learn to sympathise with drought affected farmers—will be calling on those pretend skills once again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's so dodgy—so dodgy!—that you cannot trust a word that comes out of his mouth. And when fire hits our communities across this country this summer, remember the man who has ignored pleas for an aerial firefighting fleet for years. Remember the man who is sending us into debt to the tune of $1 trillion but who couldn't find enough money to provide aerial firefighting. That's who Scott Morrison is, and no announcement regime and no amount of sophistry will be able to pull the wool over the Australian people's eyes indefinitely.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  Thank you, Mr President. I acknowledge the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples, who are the traditional custodians of the gathering place on which this parliament was built. I am a proud Djabwurrung Gunnai Gunditjmara woman and I live on Wurundjeri country. I stand before you today on the shoulders of my ancestors, who fought and died for our country. Their resistance, knowledge and strength over thousands of years has guided me to this moment and I carry their spirit with me in this chamber.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an honour to be the first Aboriginal person elected to the Senate to represent Victoria. While it's a great shame that it has taken this long, the timing could not be more significant. Outside these walls a global movement has taken to the streets to demand that black lives matter—an uprising of voices, united by the conviction that the colour of your skin should not limit your potential, your safety or your life expectancy. That was not something society told me growing up.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For an Aboriginal girl raised in poverty and public housing, who left school at 14, the idea that I could make it all the way to this nation's parliament was laughable. People like me were not meant to end up in places like this. Our voices were silenced, sidelined and written out of the story of our own country. But I never gave up believing that better days were possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from a long line of strong black women who taught me to stand up for what's right and never let injustice and racism beat you down. If you want change, you have to fight for it. I've been a human rights, climate, and forest activist. And, in 2017, I was honoured to be the first Aboriginal woman elected to the Victorian parliament. I have fought my whole life for those without a voice. My promise to the people of Victoria is: I will continue to fight for you, and I will never forget where I come from.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I take my seat in this chamber today for every person who has been discarded, discounted or left behind. It's time for your voices to be heard. For too long, power has been tightly held in the hands of the privileged. I come to this parliament not as a career politician but as someone who's done it tough and grown strong through the struggles. I'm a survivor of family and workplace violence, I was a single mum at 17, I've had to confront my own mental health issues and I know what it's like to count every cent to put food on the table.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Millions of people all over this country face similar challenges every day. They need a parliament that prioritises their right to live with dignity. Instead, they have been forgotten by a political class that sees poverty as a character flaw. It doesn't have to be this way. Right now, we have a chance to build a country that works for everyone, not just the chosen few. We stand at a crossroads.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The year 2020 will leave an enduring mark in the pages of history. This was a year that demanded we not turn our heads from the challenges that threaten our future—yes, the urgency of our climate emergency; the growing economic inequality, exposed and exacerbated by a deadly global pandemic; and the ongoing fight for racial justice. For Australia to become a mature, self-assured nation, we must recognise the long history of violence inflicted upon this country's First People and embark on a truth-telling journey to reconcile that past. These challenges are big, but so is the opportunity. This is our moment to grow as a nation, and we must be brave.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The devastating bushfires that ripped through this land were a wake-up call for those who deny we must act decisively to address the reality of a warming planet. We have watched in real time the full horror of the climate crisis and what happens when you stop caring for country. With governments of the world converging on Glasgow next November to lift their ambition on climate action, the denial, posturing and fidgeting that has gone on in this house for far too long must stop now. It's time for leadership. We must put the future of our children, our grandchildren and country ahead of the short-term interests of the fossil fuel industry. Last year, I attended the United Nations Climate Summit in Madrid and saw firsthand how big polluters are poisoning country and ripping the heart out of communities all over the world. I also saw firsthand how this government is holding the world back when it comes to global action on climate change. At a meeting of Indigenous leaders, we wept as we shared our collective grief over the destruction of our land—from the fires tearing through the Amazon to the devastation in our own backyard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Here, in Australia, we have seen Rio Tinto blow up the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara, blasting 46,000-year-old Aboriginal rock shelters in an act of cultural and environmental vandalism. We know they have more planned. In Western Victoria, ancient birthing trees are being destroyed. At this site, on Djab Wurrung country, Aboriginal women have given birth to an estimated 10,000 babies over many centuries. My ancestors' blood runs through the soil that nourishes these trees. When we lose these sacred sites, we sever the deep spiritual ties that connect our culture and language to this land. Caring for country is at the heart of who we are as Aboriginal people. As custodians of this land for thousands of years, we understand that the health of the community is only as strong as the health of our environment. We're tired of watching governments and their agencies pay lip service to an acknowledgement of country while at the same time destroying the very land they claim to respect. When we don't show genuine care for the country that nurtures us, we all suffer. That's why we can't separate climate justice from First Nations justice. We can't maintain the protection of our land if its traditional custodians are locked up, disenfranchised and dying in the numbers that represent an outrageous human rights abuse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To heal this land we must address the inequality and injustice faced by Aboriginal people. Black Lives Matter needs to be more than a trending hashtag. It must be a reckoning; a line in the sand; a call to action. To those whose skin colour affords them greater safety and justice, it's time to stop looking away from systemic racism and stand with us and say, 'no more'. George Floyd's death was that moment for many people. I take hope from the spirit of solidarity that was born from this rising consciousness. But why did it take the death of a black man on the other side of the world to wake up Australia, when our Indigenous people are the most incarcerated people on Earth?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We must now ensure that history also remembers the names of those who died in similar circumstances, right here in Australia: John Pat, David Dungay, Ms Dhu, Joyce Clarke, Kumanjayi Walker, Veronica Nelson Walker, Tanya Day and Raymond Noel Thomas, just to name a few. I wish I were afforded the time in this speech to name every life taken—441 Aboriginal people have died in custody since the royal commission in 1991. Not a single person has ever been held accountable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For years, politicians in this parliament have talked about closing the gap, but our children continue to be removed from their homes at rates far higher than white Australia. In fact, over 20,000 of our babies aren't with their families or their communities. Kids as young as 10 are held criminally responsible in this country, the vast majority of them Aboriginal. Our babies should be playing and learning, not incarcerated for petty offences, like stealing a chocolate bar.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not just statistics on a page for me. Earlier this year, I went home to grieve with my mother and our community on Gunnai country, on what the colonisers call Gippsland. Four Aboriginal people had been lost to suicide in 10 days. These tragedies reflect a profound sense of hopelessness felt by many First Nations people when they look to a future that holds little promise. Three of those young people had connections to Lake Tyers, a community where, generations earlier, my mother's family were imprisoned as refugees in their own country. It happened as part of the systematic slaughter of Aboriginal people across this nation. In Victoria alone, there were 67 massacres and more are still being uncovered. They tried to wipe my people from the land, but they failed. We are still here. We are the oldest living culture in the world, and our fight for survival is part of this nation's story. White Australia has a black history. We cannot change the past. But we can build a better future. We must reckon with our history so we can heal and move forward as one country, united by truth and common purpose. I believe Australia is ready to come with us on this journey.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last two years, I've led a dawn service on 26 January to mark a day of mourning and honour all the Aboriginal men, women and, yes, children massacred upon invasion of our country, known as the frontier wars. The vast majority of people standing shoulder to shoulder with us have been non-Indigenous Australians, sharing our grief in a spirit of healing. Their numbers grow each year. But, to truly bring this country together, we must treat not only the symptoms of disadvantage but the cause. We do this with a treaty. A treaty is a written agreement between sovereign nations, and Australia is the only Commonwealth country without one with its First People. If we write it together, treaty can be a blank canvas to reframe the story of who we want to be as a country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We can celebrate what unites us, protect the rights of First Nations people and acknowledge injustices, both past and present. There can be no justice without peace. Treaty could bring that peace. It would end the suffering and heal the wounds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why treaty must come before other debates, such as constitutional recognition, changing the date of Australia Day, or a voice to parliament, because the disadvantage and inequality we face as a community are not due to inherent failings in our character; they are symptoms of the persecution and oppression this country and its Constitution were founded upon. We can't be included in the Constitution before this chapter in Australia's history has been resolved via a treaty. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">And we mustn't replicate tick-and-flick domestic treaties that allow native title to be extinguished to make way for the destruction of country for megamines, logging or fracking. A genuine national treaty would elevate Aboriginal voices and reframe us as a more caring society where nobody is left behind. We need to make that shift, because the gap between rich and poor is growing wider. The unprecedented public health and economic crisis we're living through in 2020 has brought this into sharp focus. It has often been said that the COVID-19 virus doesn't discriminate, but we know now that its impacts do. Young people, women, migrants, the elderly, public housing residents and casualised workers are bearing the greatest burden.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to offer my condolences to the families of those whose lives have been tragically cut short by coronavirus. Through this crisis we have seen that inequality is not just a social issue; it's a major public health risk that eats away at the fabric of our society. Precarious work and insecure housing have fuelled this pandemic. When you have a low-paid, casualised workforce, inevitably people will be forced to make choices that have life-and-death consequences. Staying home when you're sick is not an option when that decision means your children go without food. Too many people are living hand-to-mouth, without job security or the dignity of a living wage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID has exposed deep cracks in our society, showing how quickly it can fall apart when people have no safety net. As we endured periods of lockdown, I thought of all the people who are permanently locked up and forgotten about by our government, like my friends Farhad and Moz, Kurdish refugees who spent seven years on Manus Island before being brought to Australia under medevac legislation. They are now locked inside a Melbourne hotel room with no prospect of release and fighting for basic rights. These men have committed no crime.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">How can we as a nation treat people like this? We are stronger as a country when we extend the hand of friendship to everyone—not just those who look like you and not just those who wear the same school tie as you do. That is what this parliament should be about—a place that represents everyone equally—because what COVID has shown us is that economic inequality is not an individual moral failing but an active political choice. The disaster in private aged care is a tragic reminder of what happens when we put the profits of big business over the dignity of our community's most vulnerable. Who's been looking after our elders? Certainly not this place—but it should have been. Through this pandemic we've seen governments find money to house the homeless, feed the hungry, support the unemployed, prop up child care and boost mental health services. These solutions to social and economic disadvantage have always been there; our political leaders have just chosen not to adopt them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We deserve so much better, and we can be better. This pivotal moment has offered us a unique opportunity to re-imagine our society. From the ashes of this crisis, we can rebuild in a way that addresses our overriding national challenges—justice for First Nations people, reducing inequality and addressing climate change. We can create a community where the collective good outweighs individual self-interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look to that future, I think of the lessons we can learn from the matriarchs in my family. My great grandmother Edna Brown arrived in Melbourne on the back of a truck in 1932 after being forced off the Framlingham Aboriginal reserve near Warrnambool as part of the White Australia assimilation policy during the Great Depression. Back then, it was common for Aboriginal people to be buried as paupers in unmarked graves. Nan Edna wanted to offer the dignity in death that so many of our people were denied in life. She set up the Aboriginal Funeral Fund, supporting families to bury their loved ones. After Nan Edna, her daughter, my Nan Alma Thorpe, was one of the founders of the first Aboriginal Health Service in Victoria in 1973—the year I was born. To this day that service is saving lives. That is kinship. It is self-determination, and strength through community. And then there's my mum, Marjorie Thorpe—a co-commissioner for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing Them Home</span> Stolen Generation inquiry and a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, which inspired a quarter of a million people to walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 2000 in a powerful gesture of social solidarity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where I come from. As I followed these strong women, I learned through one of the toughest periods of my life that strength comes from community. Living in the Collingwood housing commission flats saved my life. Public housing helped me escape family violence and gave me and my son the safety and stability I needed to get a job and pursue further education. That is what everyone deserves—a safe place to call home, secure work, food in their belly and the hope of a future with potential. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">If the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that our society is weaker when people don't have these basic rights. The people in this chamber have the power to change that. We can do more of the same or we can offer our kids and grandkids a politics of hope. The solutions to the big problems we face are there in the way my people have looked after each other for generations—holistic health care, caring for country, kinship and self-determination. We can give everyone the dignity of a living wage and lift people out of poverty. And it's not too late to tackle the climate emergency. But we can't be fooled by a gas-led recovery backed by both sides of this House. The only safe road out of our economic and climate crisis is one that creates thousands of jobs in renewable energy. We can write a treaty that acknowledges our past and brings us together to heal as a nation. That's why I'm here—to fight for the change that will unite and strengthen our country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be a senator for all of us. To our LGBTIQ+ community: know that I've got your back. Together we won marriage equality, but the fight for your rights is not over, particularly for trans and gender-diverse people. To the activists fighting to protect our country, climate and human rights: I stand with you. To all those women who have been trapped, who've been made to feel worthless or unsafe, who've been told time after time to sit down and be silent—whether in your home, your workplace or wherever you go—I see you, I've been you and I will not forget you. To Greens members and voters who have backed me on this journey, I thank you. I chose the Greens as my political home because it's a grassroots movement that won't sell out to vested interests that have corrupted our democracy. And I'd like to pay tribute to the person whose shoes I now fill, Richard Di Natale, a leader of great integrity and passion: thank you for your service and support. I also pay my respects to the other First Nations MPs who have walked this road before me. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">And I thank my sisters, Arika and Meriki; my partner, Gavan; my children, Andrew, Kowirra and Kaiaan; my daughter-in-law, Jackie; my granddaughters, Illuka and Ngakaya; and nephew Kadel—for loving and supporting me through this journey and for your sacrifices that got me here.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, to every person watching today, particularly those who have lost hope in politics as a vehicle for change, I say this to you: change is possible. Hold me and every other elected representative in this place accountable. Our job is to serve you. We have an opportunity to build a stronger, more unified nation. I invite you all to come on this journey with me, a journey of truth-telling, healing and justice. Together, we can build a brighter future. And I'm here to fight for it. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  I rise to speak on this MPI. Again I find myself thanking a senator on the other side for putting up an MPI which for us is really just a dorothy dixer. It's really quite amazing. It is quite ironic that the Labor Party want to bring this topic up as we enter another disaster season. Politicising disaster preparedness, response and recovery is nothing new for the Australian Labor Party. After all, we know they have form in this space, especially in my home state of Victoria. The Andrews government's so-called reforms of the fire services, at the behest of their union mates, undermined the coordination of firefighting across the state last fire season, especially in the regional cities, and has led to poor morale, loss of expertise and the decimation of volunteers in our beloved Country Fire Authority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I found the comments from some of those opposite during their contributions, particularly around firefighting, quite amazing. We heard from an actual aerial firefighter, Senator Molan. He talked about how well we are prepared with our aerial firefighting fleet. The government is working with states and territories to implement the recommendations of the royal commission. It's important to note that 128 out of 158 aircraft that are used for firefighting are Australian owned and operated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I found it quite amazing that Senator Watt—who was very, very active during question time on some of these issues and is the shadow minister for emergency management—has only just this last week accepted an invitation for a briefing with Emergency Management Australia on our seasonal preparation. Again, Senator Urquhart moving this MPI prior to that briefing just further demonstrates that Labor is simply not interested in facts. The Labor Party are not interested in how well prepared Australia actually is. Those decisions have left Victoria at a substantially higher risk now and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I spoke about the impacts of bushfires on my home state of Victoria and how, along with Victoria's first responders, the ADF had made a vital contribution to the safety and welfare of Victorians. We, as we all should in this place, know that emergency management is primarily a state or territory responsibility. Certainly during COVID the difference between states, and what states were managing and what the Commonwealth had to manage, was brought into stark contrast. However, we saw right through both the COVID crisis and the bushfire crisis earlier in the year that the Australian government ensured that everyone had support or was at least offered support by the ADF.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has substantially reformed national disaster payments, implemented the Emergency Response Fund and increased Australia's aerial firefighting responsibility. You have to remember that the funding that we've put forward, the Emergency Response Fund, is for response and recovery, so to claim we haven't spent any of that money is simply ridiculous. The fund, the $4 billion fund, is set-up to spend up to $200 million per year on various things. Just this last month the minister for disaster recovery, Minister Littleproud, has signed off on some of those funds to go out the door.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party voted for the establishment of Emergency Response Fund knowing full well the circumstances in which it can be accessed. As I mentioned, the $150 million each financial year to fund emergency response and recovery is when the government determines that existing recovery programs are insufficient to meet the scale. The further $50 million in each financial year is to build resilience and that comes to prepare or reduce the risk of future natural disasters. We know that Labor don't understand these things, but I think we can see that this MPI was a farce.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I would like to highlight the committee's concerns about the exemption of emergency delegated legislation from disallowance. Disallowance is one of the most important tools that the parliament has at its disposal to maintain control of delegated legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the importance of this procedure, nearly 20 per cent of all delegated legislation made in response to the pandemic between January and July this year was exempt from disallowance.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This includes all 27 legislative instruments made under the Biosecurity Act, and six Advance to the Finance Minister determinations, which allocated an additional $2.1 billion of public funds to aspects of the government's response to COVID-19.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consequently, parliamentarians have been prevented from scrutinising and, if necessary, disallowing, significant COVID-19 response measures. These include travel bans on Australian citizens, the declaration and extension of the human biosecurity emergency period, and restrictions on people entering and exiting certain areas within Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee fully appreciates the government's need to make such laws in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, where such laws have the capacity to restrict personal rights and liberties or override laws made by parliament, the committee considers that parliamentarians must—I underline must—have the capacity to scrutinise and, if necessary, disallow these laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee was also concerned to discover that one in five non-disallowable legislative instruments made in response to COVID-19 are exempt from disallowance due to pre-existing grounds determined by the executive, rather than the parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To inform this inquiry, the committee found that 48 per cent of non-disallowable legislative instruments made in response to COVID-19 between January and July this year appeared to raise potential technical scrutiny issues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We trust that this interim report, and its focus on delegated legislation made in response to COVID-19, provides a useful case study of the detrimental impact of longstanding, systemic issues on parliament's capacity to appropriately oversee delegated legislation made in times of emergency.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  I just want to take a few moments to associate myself with the remarks by Senator Fierravanti-Wells. When I first came into this place, I had, to be frank, no idea about this committee. Quite frankly, it's probably one of the committees where I most enjoy my time with colleagues, and it is good to see other colleagues on this committee in the chamber at the moment. It has been fascinating to see how our democracy works and being in the Senate, the house of review, keeping the executive accountable. I know there is only one member of the executive in the place currently. It is fair to say that we enjoy our time on the committee scrutinising the delegated legislation and the instruments, following up with ministers and ensuring that we as parliamentarians are doing our jobs as part of our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation—and it has had other names along the way—is certainly one of the oldest committees in this place. Its purpose is to ensure that we are scrutinising delegated legislation enacted by members of the executive and that it is subject to appropriate scrutiny by the legislator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a role of us in this place to write the laws of the land. I think many Australians would be surprised to learn just how much law is written. As we heard from the chair of the committee, close to 50 per cent is written, enacted and given the stamp of approval by the executive, not the parliament. Whilst there is no doubting that there is a role for such delegated legislation to exist, it is nonetheless appropriate that, in an instance where law is made by members of the executive, it is subject to appropriate oversight by this parliament and by this Senate, most importantly to disallow in instances where it is resolved by the Senate that such a measure is necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the report articulates, the volume of delegated legislation as a proportion of total Commonwealth law is substantial. Even more substantial is the proportion of this delegated legislation that is exempted from scrutiny. All Australians should be concerned at the readiness with which government is prepared to exempt delegated legislation from consideration by the parliament. As mentioned earlier, whilst there is merit in the existence of delegated legislation, one is right to question whether exemption provisions for this legislation is entirely in accordance with the principles of the separation of powers that make up all good systems of governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim report that's been tabled has a particular focus on the emergency delegated legislation that has come about as a result of the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost a quarter of these measures, some of which had a significant impact on the community, were exempted from disallowance. Questions as to whether the individual freedoms of our citizenry ought to be curtailed are some of the most significant that any decision-maker in this building may be forced to consider. Owing to this, those questions necessarily ought to be subject to as high a standard of democratic examination as one would expect in a nation such as ours. Regrettably, the report also finds instances where government falls short of this standard and the systemic reasons for how this has come about. As the Senate, as a democratically elected body representative of the community, we must resist this; after all, we are the house of review. Whilst I fully appreciate why government—any government, for that matter—would like to dispense with such inconvenience wherever possible, we owe it to those who have gone before us and, with much toil, have established our norms of parliamentary primacy in lawmaking to clearly demonstrate the bounds of the tolerance of this chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I rise to speak on this report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation and, indeed, do so as an outside, not a member of this very important committee of the parliament. I want to say—and I mean this genuinely—that the words used by Senator Fierravanti-Wells in addressing this report are some of the most important words that have been spoken in this chamber in the time that I've been here. I want to reflect on something I heard today in the chamber, and then I'll come back to the point that Senator Fierravanti-Wells made. Senator Paterson, during the committee stage of the foreign affairs legislation, made the statement that the government is responsible to the people. That is not actually the case under our Constitution. The way it works is that the government of the day is responsible, through ministers, to this parliament and it is this parliament that is responsible to the people. That's really important. I'll go to the Constitution to illustrate the importance of the statements being made in the chamber. Section 1 of our Constitution, entitled 'Legislative power', states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives, and which is hereinafter called <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Parliament</span> or <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Parliament of the Commonwealth</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the parliament's role to pass laws. That's a really important principle, because the people who write the delegated legislation, of which half in volume is written by officials, are not responsible to the people. They are not able to be removed by a vote of the people. In fact it's very difficult even for a minister to remove a person who might be writing this delegated legislation. When legislation is to be considered, it ought to be done in an open manner in the Senate chamber, where it can be debated and where the people can watch and hear what people say. And once every three years, or perhaps six in the case of some senators, they can exercise their right either to support that member or have them removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">An honourable senator:</span>  Hold them accountable.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Hold them accountable—thank you. That is not the case for delegated legislation, and it concerns me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we should pay regard to the two very senior people who are the chair and the deputy chair of the committee. They have a great deal of experience in this place. I commend Senator Fierravanti-Wells. It's a committee I really didn't notice very much until Senator Fierravanti-Wells started to chair it. Having someone as strong as Senator Fierravanti-Wells backed up by Senator Carr is a very powerful combination. I used to watch Wacka Williams come in here; he would stand up and move these motions announcing a possible disallowance, and I used to think: 'Jeez, he's a rebel.' Of course, I like rebels. I love rebels! Perhaps falsely, that was how I developed an affinity with Wacka. But since this committee has been chaired by the current chair and deputy chair, I've certainly started to take notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must congratulate Senator Fierravanti-Wells for the job that she's doing. Again, I say her contribution this afternoon is one of the most important contributions I have heard in this chamber during my time here. I would ask that all senators listen to what has been said and look at the series of reports that are coming from this committee, because it's directed at us and our responsibility to our Constitution and to the people we represent.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  I, too, would like to make some remarks on this interim report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry into the exemption of delegated legislation from parliamentary oversight</span>. First, if I could acknowledge the kind remarks from Senator Patrick—I couldn't agree more. I also associate myself with the remarks of Senator Ciccone and, given he associated himself with the remarks of Senator Fierravanti-Wells, that means I'm associating myself with your remarks, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. So we're all associates!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Patrick, you are absolutely correct that we, serving on this committee, are very fortunate to have Senator Fierravanti-Wells as our chair and Senator Carr—not Scarr!—as our deputy chair. As a relatively new senator to this place—in the class of 2019 with my good friends Senator Ciccone, Senator Davey and Senator Green, who is not here today, but I'm sure she would concur—there are three things I've taken from the leadership demonstrated by Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Carr on this committee. Firstly, the importance of the experience and wisdom that they bring to the process. It is irreplaceable and just so important. Secondly, the collegiality with which they have conducted themselves. One of the lessons I've learned from serving on this committee is that you have to divorce the partisan from the nonpartisan and I think both Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Carr do that extremely well. Thirdly, and most importantly, is the deep and abiding respect they each have for the institution of parliament. That respect for the institution of parliament is reflected in this report. It's reflected in the first recommendation of this report, that parliamentarians—we're not just politicians—give 'adequate consideration to the appropriateness of exempting delegated legislation from parliamentary oversight mechanisms'. We should do that as parliamentarians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reflecting on that point, that we're parliamentarians first and foremost, I commend to my colleagues that they look at sections 4.31 and 4.33 of the report, which contain some quotes from submissions made to the inquiry. Section 4.31 states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… 'the rule-making process should or needs to be separated from the political process'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 4.33 states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… determinations should be exempt from disallowance to prevent political considerations interfering with what should be a technical and scientific process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those quotes are from two submissions made by government departments, and I think they reflect more than anything an institutional view with respect to these matters, an institutional view which we as senators need to be aware of, and in the context, through this report, where we are robustly reasserting the importance of the parliamentary processes. What are these political processes? What are these political considerations? Are they not parliamentarians—not just politicians—as democratically elected representatives exercising their judgement on behalf of their constituents and their country? That's what these political considerations are. Are they not parliamentarians making an assessment on how the proposed laws of the land will impact upon the people they represent and their country? Those are the political considerations. Are they not parliamentarians acting as a check and balance upon the executive, we in this place acting as a house of review, as Senator Ciccone referred to? Are they not parliamentarians being accountable to and facing their constituents on a regular basis in free and fair elections as part of a liberal democracy? Those are the political considerations. They go to the absolute heart of our liberal democracy, and we must always remember that and cherish it, respecting the institution of parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I too would like to give some thanks to the members of the secretariat who worked on the report. Senator Fierravanti-Wells, one person we should always remember is 'the Prof', Professor Edgar. Where would we be without our good Professor Edgar? He is always there to give his wisdom and educated view on sometimes the most arcane of legal matters. Thank you, Professor Edgar; thank you, Glenn, Laura and the team. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">FEDERAL CIRCUIT AND FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA BILL 2019</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is with great pleasure that I introduce to this Parliament a package of legislation that will reduce the costs and delays that thousands of Australian families experience as a result of a split federal family law court system. This legislative package will create greater efficiencies in the federal family law court system and, in turn, assist families navigating the court system during what can be some of the most difficult and distressing times of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government first introduced this Bill package into the Parliament in August 2018; it lapsed when the Parliament was prorogued. Since then, the Government has worked to strengthen and improve the suite of measures to respond to some of the concerns raised, while still fundamentally delivering a structural reform of the federal family law courts that will assist families to have their matters dealt with quickly, efficiently, cheaply and as safely as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill brings together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia as an overarching, unified administrative structure to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. The Family Court will continue in existence as the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 1), and the Federal Circuit Court will continue in existence as the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 2). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill creates a consistent pathway for Australian families in having their family law disputes dealt within the federal courts. Under the Government's reform, there will be a single point of entry for the federal family law jurisdiction and, ultimately, a common set of rules, practices and procedures, and approach to case management. The reforms enabled by these Bills will improve user experience for those Australian families that unfortunately need the assistance of the courts to resolve their disputes, and promote improved practices by both courts, and legal practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The structural reforms and legislation to give them effect, have been developed and informed by a number of substantial inquiries over the last decade, including the 2008 Semple review, a 2014 KPMG review, a 2015 EY report, the 2017 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs inquiry, and most recently a 2018 PwC report, and these were also tabled in the Parliament when the Bills were first introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the Bills were last before the Parliament, the Government has carefully considered the comments made and issues raised by court users, legal and other professional stakeholders, House of Representative members, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and members of the general public. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And while there was disagreement about what approach the Government should take, there is widespread recognition that the current structural arrangements in the courts are just not working for Australian families. The Government remains committed to resolving these structural failings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To address some of the key concerns identified by stakeholders, the Government has made several changes to the package as it was before the last Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will no longer create a Family Law Appeals Division in the Federal Court. The Bill instead preserves the existing Family Court's appellate jurisdiction within the FCFC (Division 1). While the Bill will retain the appellate jurisdiction in the FCFC (Division 1), the Bill provides that there will no longer be an Appeals Division for select judges to be appointed to, but rather, Division 1 judges will be able to hear appeals, both as individual judges and as members of a Full Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Bill will enable the Court to deal with appeals more efficiently, as appeals from decisions of the FCFC (Division 2) will be ordinarily dealt with by a single judge from Division 1. The Chief Justice will have the ability to convene a Full Court to hear an appeal from Division 2, where appropriate. This will provide flexibility for a Full Court to hear appeals involving novel or complex questions of law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both of these changes reflect the approach taken in the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court, which successfully exercises a substantial and diverse appellate jurisdiction. This approach will enhance the courts' ability to resolve family law matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also now makes much clearer how the single point of entry for first instance family law matters in the Federal Circuit and Family Court will operate, by providing that all original jurisdiction family law applications are to be made to the FCFC (Division 2), with matters able to be transferred to Division 1 as appropriate. Implementing a single point of entry in this way is a significant and long-called for reform to improve the user experience with the family law courts and enhance the unified identity of the Federal Circuit and Family Court. Coupled with the harmonisation of rules and case management approaches, it will reduce confusion, and create a much simpler pathway for resolving disputes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was to require judicial appointments to the FCFC (Division 2) to involve consideration of whether the person has the appropriate skills, knowledge, experience and personality. The Australian Law Reform Commission made a similar recommendation for the appointment of judicial officers exercising family law to involve consideration of the person's knowledge, experience, skills and aptitude relevant to hearing family law cases, including cases involving family violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill now provides that for a person to be appointed to the FCFC (Division 1), or appointed to the FCFC (Division 2) and expected to deal with family law matters, the person is, by reason of knowledge, skills, experience and aptitude, suitable to deal with family law matters, including matters involving family violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Bill now provides for: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a time-limited period for the Chief Justice/Chief Judge of the FCFC to be empowered to make Rules of Court to ensure they are consistent across both the FCFC (Division 1) and FCFC (Division 2). After a period of two years, the power to make Rules of Court will revert to the judges of each court, or a majority of them;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">retaining the existing parities between the Family Court of Western Australia and the federal courts; and </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">requiring the legislation to be reviewed five years after commencement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms are consistent with the Parliament's powers to create and invest federal jurisdiction in courts other than the High Court under Chapter III of the Constitution. No existing Court is being abolished as a result of the legislation. Current judicial appointments will continue in the new structure, with no changes to the terms or conditions of existing judges. The Bill ensures that the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 1) is considered a superior court of record and a court of law and equity, and the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 2) is considered a court of record and a court of law and equity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government, as part of this reform, has also committed to providing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">an extra $4 million in funding to the federal courts to review court rules and assist with implementing the reforms; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">an extra $3.7 million over the forward estimates for an additional FCFC judge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, while the Government is committed to ensuring that the courts are appropriately resourced, it is not a good use of taxpayer funds to appoint additional judges without first addressing fundamental structural problems within the courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms enabled by the legislation introduced today also build on the measures the Government has already taken to improve the family law system, and this Government's commitment to ongoing improvements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms in this Bill are a valuable and vital piece of family law reform, and will play an important role in providing Australian families with an effective and much improved experience when navigating the family law system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019 forms part of the Government's package of legislative reforms to the structure of the federal courts which will enhance the experience of Australian families in the family law system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is a companion bill to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 (the primary Bill). It facilitates the transition for court users from the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (FCFC) on commencement of the legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In February 2019 the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee delivered its report on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. The report outlined five recommendations. The Government paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Committee, and the present legislation package addresses the key concerns raised by the Committee and stakeholders regarding the 2018 Bills, while maintaining the critical objectives of the reforms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill repeals and amends substantial parts of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Act 1975,</span> as these provisions will now be covered by the primary Bill. Similarly, the Bill repeals the <span style="font-style:italic;">Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999.</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>There are also some amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Federal Court Act 1976 </span>to achieve greater consistency between the federal courts and in recognition that the primary Bill will provide for the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia to have its own Chief Executive Officer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes consequential amendments across the Commonwealth statute book to reflect the continuation of the Family Court as the FCFC (Division 1) and the Federal Circuit Court as the FCFC (Division 2) and to update other references to legislation. The Bill also includes a number of contingent amendments to reflect the effect of other Bills currently before the Parliament that refer to the Family Court or Federal Circuit Court, or judges or officers of the court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also ensures that appropriate transitional arrangements are in place, including for matters before the federal courts at the time of commencement of the primary Bill. For example, it clarifies the arrangements for situations where matters have not been substantively heard before commencement, and where matters have been substantively heard in whole or part before commencement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will commence at the same time as the primary Bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On behalf of the Government I extend my thanks to the hard working and dedicated judges and officers of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. Your jobs could in no way be described as easy, but we are confident that this package of measures will go some distance to assist you in your task of helping Australian families to resolve their disputes. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In moving this motion on the Corporations Amendment (Litigation Funding) Regulations 2020 made under the Corporations Act 2001, I will argue that the regulations should be disallowed by the parliamentarians in this parliament. I hark back to the contributions of my colleagues recently with regard to the scrutiny of bills committee and the work that has been undertaken there, because this is a perfect example of government by regulation and of what is wrong with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulations that I seek the support of the Senate to disallow today were arbitrarily determined and advanced without warning by the Treasurer, Mr Josh Frydenberg. The regulations as they stand apply to all Australians. They are not fit for purpose, and they prejudged the report of a committee of inquiry that the government itself set up. These regulations that I'm asking the Senate to disallow today are rushed and careless and will only make it more difficult for ordinary Australians to access justice against deep-pocketed corporates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank members of the crossbench for their many conversations with me in recent weeks in seeking their support to disallow the action of the Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg. I particularly want to thank Senator Stirling Griff, Senator Rex Patrick and Senator Jacqui Lambie for taking a position that indicates that they really are aware how much this is costing in terms of people's access to justice and that it is a piece of regulation made on the fly by the Treasurer. The Treasurer established an inquiry into litigation funding on 13 May and, only nine days later, on 22 May, stood up and brought in these regulations. There's a famous saying: 'The doors of justice are just like the doors of the Ritz Carlton—anybody can walk in, but money determines who can stay.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Litigation funders enable ordinary Australians to get their day in court. They're critical in helping launch class actions on wage theft, on the poisoning of farmlands and on properties and businesses affected by poor flood controls, and they've been instrumental in enabling justice for citizens who were affected by the PFAS contaminations and had to fight their own government. In addition, litigation funders support consumers who are ripped off by big corporates. Litigation funders give access to justice to those ordinarily unable to afford it and deter the government and other deep-pocketed entities from reckless and harmful behaviour. Labor believes that litigation funders should be regulated, but only by an appropriate and fit-for-purpose regime that keeps their vital purpose intact and allows for healthy competition between funders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind members of the crossbench that the government established the inquiry to deliver its report on this matter on 13 May. Just a few days later, on 22 May, the government changed its mind and brought in this regulation that I'm asking you to disallow this afternoon. The government's approach has been to impose regulations that will reduce competition in the industry and frustrate and deter ordinary Australians who look to our justice system to right wrongs and secure compensation. This is for people in difficult circumstances who find themselves up against the giants of the corporate world and their own government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of waiting for the joint committee inquiry, which the government itself set up, to run its natural course, instead of acting on the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission report into class actions and litigation, which, again, this government commissioned, Josh Frydenberg has rushed these regulations through in a chaotic and thoughtless way. Using the cover of the pandemic, the Treasurer decided to pass legislation through to change the regulation of litigation funders to that of a managed investment scheme as well as to require them to obtain an Australian financial services licence. Funded class actions were never meant to be considered as a managed investment scheme and overseen by ASIC in that form. The funders themselves say that the onerous regulatory burden will force funders out of the market, lessen competition and increase the cost of access to justice.</span>

                    </a>  Indeed, Senator Patrick, I'll take that interjection. ASIC did not want this regulation to be established in that way. We're on the record, on many occasions, as saying a managed investment scheme was an entirely inappropriate way to manage this activity of litigation funders. The regulations as they now stand, because of this disallowance, appear to lack the support of Pauline Hanson's One Nation. I do worry in these uncertain times for many businesses and many Australians right across this country that having a limitation on their access to justice and the continuation of a managed investment scheme structure, and AFSLs, which were constructed without consultation, is not a good outcome for the Australian people—like the Michel's Patisserie franchisees who are seeking recompense in a class action against exorbitant fees forced on them by their franchisors as investors in a managed investment scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson hasn't declared her position at this point of time in the Senate, and I'll still continue to seek her support for my disallowance, to give the Australian people some certainty in the coming period, making sure that no money, time or energy continues to be spent on delivering a managed investment scheme, which we know is an entirely inappropriate vehicle for litigation funding. We want no further uncertainty or limitation of access to justice, or continuance in the haphazard way that the government has gone about this so far. If this disallowance isn't passed this evening it will hurt organisations like the Australian Farmers Fighting Fund, which supports class actions that affect their members, such as in the class actions against the live export ban. It will also hurt workers seeking their only avenue for justice in wage theft cases, because the government cravenly refuses to pass appropriate wage theft laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Robert Gibson, a former stockbroker, a director of three stockbroking firms and the lead plaintiff in the landmark Murray Goulburn class action, gave evidence to the PJC inquiry. I want to give voice to his evidence, because he debunked the government's narrative that naive Australians are being ripped off by rapacious funders and being denied their access to justice. Large amounts of money are involved in litigation funded cases, that is true, but they could be excellently considered structures to make sure that Australians get the best value out of those decisions and get the majority of the allocation of any awards that might be determined by the court. I know that Senator Hanson is interested in that matter, and I'm very keen to make sure that that outcome is delivered too. That's why I'll continue to say that today we should disallow this regulation by Mr Frydenberg. We should give Australians certainty and we should make sure that this government, which has acted arbitrarily and dangerously in this regard comes back and puts something that has been considered carefully on the table early in the new year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry should listen to these individuals who've actually interacted with class action funders. We have listened, and we're at a point now where I believe that it's clear that the government's ill-conceived scheme, introduced as regulation, is not fit for purpose and should not be allowed to continue. The government even managed to bungle the rollout of this scheme which they've imposed on us by first giving ASIC, the Australian Securities Investment Commission, only a single day's notice before announcing the changes. They forgot to release the required statement regarding the impacts of the regulatory change on business and individuals. These errors alone from this government show how poorly conceived this idea was and how rushed, how sloppy and how damaging regulatory leadership by the Treasurer is proving to be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These regulations were not the sober reflection of a government following a commission, report or inquiry. They're merely the scribblings in the margins of a party manifesto or a cliff note scrawled on the back of a lobbyist's card discreetly tucked into a minister's pocket. They're heavy on ideology but utterly scant on detail. Is this really what should be at the top of this government's priorities during a global pandemic? These regulations also go against the advice that Treasury gave to then Treasurer Scott Morrison in a review that it conducted in 2015, where it said there was:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the court case called Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd unintentionally captured litigation funders in the AFSL regime and the MIS provisions of the Corporations Act, ASIC then swiftly moved to grant them relief from these requirements because ASIC believed the plaintiffs would 'suffer considerable delay, expense, uncertainty and disruption as a consequence of the decision'. That is why senators, particularly those on the crossbench who I'm calling on to support my disallowance motion, should support what I'm asking them to do today: these regulations will cause delay, they will cause expense, they are causing uncertainty and they are disrupting the litigation funding action in this country.</span>

He has refused to release key documentation between ASIC and the Treasurer's office to the government's inquiry into these very changes, claiming public interest immunity—that we shouldn't know the conversations that were going on in the background that led the Treasurer of Australia to one day announce an inquiry and a mere nine days later ignore his own direction and come in with regulations over the top. Why is there such secrecy? If the Treasurer has nothing to hide, if his motives are pure and he's acting in the best interest of the Australian public, why on earth would he try to hide that from the joint committee? Secrecy, speed and sloppiness are the three hallmarks of these regulatory changes. You cannot trust this government's future promises of support or reform.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of the committee that delivered the bipartisan report into whistleblowers, I note that the government promised to act on that the urgent need for protections. They made that promise three years ago. We are still waiting. I was also a member of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee, that released the landmark report on industrial manslaughter two years ago. We reported, and people were here in the gallery—mothers and fathers in tears for the loss of their children, their husbands, their partners. For two years the government has done nothing. They had the power. They had two whole years to do something. They did nothing to help. You cannot trust the word of this government. You cannot trust their promises. You can only draw the appropriate conclusions from their actions.</span>

The government would have you believe that litigation funders are a bunch of ambulance chasers helping find funds for spurious class actions. But they are giving people access to justice. The regulations as they stand do not protect everyday Australians. I know from my professional conversations with Senator Hanson that she, like me, wants Australians to get access to justice and also to be able to get their fair share of whatever the court decides.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that that's your intention, Senator Hanson. I urge you to stand on the side of the Australian people: disallow this motion and give them some comfort. Do not trust this government, who have been found so wanting in delivering the promises they have made in this place, time after time, day after day, year after year. I urge you to act in the interests of the Australian people.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  The biggest barrier to justice in this country is financial—that is, the capacity of ordinary people to have their day in court and seek justice. Class actions are crucial to that end. We should be making it easier for people to organise and collectivise to seek justice and take legal action. We should not be making it more difficult, which is what the government is trying to do. The Greens will be supporting this disallowance motion because it is essential that everyday people can access the courts to have the opportunity to fix wrongs they have suffered. In the main, those wrongs have historically been suffered in this country through the actions of governments or the actions of big corporations. The government's Corporations Amendment (Litigation Funding) Regulations do not make it easier for ordinary Australians to access the courts when they've suffered a wrong, a loss or an injury. In fact, they make it harder, and they make it harder deliberately and by design.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's regulations require litigation funders to hold an Australian financial services licence. That would include not-for-profit funders like, for example, the Australian Farmers Fighting Fund. The regulations also specify that class actions are managed investment schemes. The government's regulations treat everyday, ordinary Australians who are seeking compensation from corporate or government wrongdoing as if they were some kind of investor seeking to make a profit. Even the corporate regulator ASIC says that the government's regulations are not suitable. The government is trying to make it harder for everyday people to right wrongs by seeking justice through having their day in court. We're talking about people, for example, who are being poisoned by toxic PFAS chemicals. And let's not forget the thousands of people who were totally shafted by this government's robodebt debacle. Research has shown that people who rely on class actions are people who would normally face considerable barriers to asserting their rights in court and accessing the justice that we actually established our court system to deliver. Many are elderly or injured, have disabilities or are dealing with incredible grief or distress because of things that they are suing about. And yet the government wants to make it harder for them to achieve justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A good government would begin by making a formal response to the Australian Law Reform Commission's report into litigation funding, which the Attorney-General has had for almost two years now. A good government would consider the 24 recommendations in that report and use them as a base to develop solid and sensible regulations that enable everyday Australians to access our justice system a little bit more easily. Going to court, particularly to get relief from corporate or government wrongdoing, should not be an obstacle course. Everyone needs transparency and certainty and, of course, appropriate regulation, but we should be generating regulation to protect and assist those who are constantly locked out of the legal system simply because they cannot afford to access justice. But this government's regulations are not that kind of regulation. They are actually designed to make it more difficult for people to have their day in court and to access justice, and that is why the Australian Greens will support this motion to disallow them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  I rise to make a brief contribution to this debate and indicate that I will be supporting the disallowance that has been moved. Just to summarise what Senator O'Neill talked about: there was an inquiry established and, part way through the inquiry being established, a regulation was then tabled by the Treasurer. It caught ASIC completely by surprise. And, indeed, there aren't many people on the other side of the chamber itching to stand up and defend this particular regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a regulation that I believe will reduce access to justice for small people. That is my deep concern in relation to this regulation. I do understand that Senator Hanson is actually trying to work constructively with the government to find perhaps a more sophisticated arrangement that seeks to balance out protections. I note that, in some sense, this regulation may have come as a result of some senior lawyers actually doing the wrong thing. But I point out that in that situation, in that particular case, the court actually dealt with those people in a very, very firm way. So we can have the status quo whilst a bill is developed with Senator Hanson, and I'd be very open to supporting such a bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'd just point out that we have heard one of the difficulties with not disallowing something and then waiting for the government to do something. We've mentioned whistleblowers. Whistleblower legislation is the example foremost in my mind. ICAC is another one. There is a stream of different pieces of legislation promised by the government. I thank Senator Hanson; I note she has come into the chamber. Often she does sit and listen to what everyone's got to say and considers what is being said. I'd just say that it would be much better to disallow this and have the Treasurer wanting Senator Hanson's support rather than letting this through and then having Senator Hanson needing the Treasurer to make a decision. She will be in a much stronger position negotiating the legislation that she's seeking if this instrument is disallowed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  I rise tonight to speak in favour of this disallowance motion and I do so on behalf of many of those who have taken the very difficult step to take on a corporation, a big bank, a big insurer or indeed their own government when they or their community have been wronged, often at the expense of their farms, their environment or their children's health. What we see today is just one step in the government's attack on justice and the participatory democracy that is so fundamental in this country. This is just one block in the wall that this government wants to put up between ordinary Australians being able to seek justice and the government being able to shelter and look after its big corporate mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that at the moment there are a number of class actions on foot, one of which is controversial in this place and relates to the management of water in the Murray-Darling Basin. We know there are a bunch of small farmers in the Riverina area who are desperately fighting for justice because of the incompetent mismanagement of water. While this class action is on foot, we've just a seen a report come out of New South Wales ICAC that shows that the injustices committed against everyday farmers like those in the Riverina did happen and were overseen by the New South Wales government and—lo and behold!—at this point nothing can happen. Those farmers, those who are fighting for their communities, deserve their day in court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do they afford to get their day in court? They do it by coming together and funding those costs collectively. This disallowance motion would make it nearly impossible for those communities to stand up for themselves, their environment, their farms and their future. We know that after the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria it took a class action to deliver real justice for those impacted. There is also another class action on foot and that is from a number of young people who are standing up for their right to a safe climate and a healthy environment, those who are taking class action to stop the Whitehaven Vickery coalmine. Those young people have a right to justice and a right to have their day in court. How do they do it if they don't come from rich families? They have to be able to rely on litigation funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely crystal clear that this move by the government is designed to shut down ordinary Australians and to shut them out of the justice system and being able to participate in accessing redress. We know that this is an attack by the government that is just one part of the process, but, in doing so, the government is covering the backsides of big corporates, of the big banks, of big pharma, of the big insurance companies, of the big agriculture and irrigation corporations. Many of these corporations are foreign owned multinationals that come into people's communities, poison their water and rip up their land, and the communities are left with nothing, except when they decide to fight back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what litigation funding allows. It's for everyday Australians who have been wronged so that they are able to take on the injustice they have suffered for themselves and for each other. It is a fundamental part of our system. To take this away is simply giving the green light to big, greedy corporations in this country to keep treating everyday Australians terribly, like mugs, while having absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions. We know that often class actions that are brought forward are uncomfortable for the government of the day. These class actions could be taking on a government department, a government agency or a corporate mate of the government of the day. But a responsible or a representative government does not take away the right of their citizens to access justice and to have their arguments, their issues and their position heard in court. That is a fundamental part of the Australian democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said that these regulations are just one part of the government's attack on everyday Australians accessing justice and participating in our democracy. Next in line, of course, we have the government arguing to ban secondary boycotts, to ban the idea of the community and individual citizens coming together to make choices about where they want to spend their money. It is just not okay. This is an attack on democracy. It's an attack on access to justice and it is an attack on the freedom of Australians. It is not the type of position or ethos that should come from the conservatives in this place, for heaven's sake. But, when it comes to covering the backsides of their big corporate mates, they'll sweep aside the concerns of regular Australians and they'll chip, chip, chip away at these fundamental rights. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important for the Senate today to vote in support of this disallowance motion, to sweep away this attack and to send a clear message to those on the other side that we are not going to sit by and let everyday Australians be taken for granted just because the people abusing the land and their workers' rights and their freedoms happen to be cosy corporate mates—big agriculture, big pharma, the big banks and the big insurance companies. They're the ones who desperately want this motion to fail because they don't want to be held to account in court for their negligence, their misinformation and their disregard for the rights and freedoms of everyday people and for the environment. I urge the crossbench not to give big pharma, the big banks and the big irrigators a win today. Give everyday Australians and our community the assurance they need that, if something goes wrong, they can have their day in court and they don't have to be rich to access justice. They should be able to work together, fund together and make sure that they can access justice in a way that delivers the proper redress, if that is indeed what the court of the day decides.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  There is a very important decision to be made with regard to this disallowance motion. I know the passion Senator O'Neill has about this. She's concerned about the Australian people, as all of us are. But listening to these speeches today—boy, I've heard some spin put on it, and the truth hasn't even come out. So, the people who are listening or watching are thinking, 'What's going on here?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't favour either side in this place—neither the Liberals and Nationals nor Labor. All the decisions I make here are based on research and from listening to both sides. I've had constant conversations with Senator O'Neill with regard to this; I've listened to her. I've had discussions with the government as well, about finding the right decision for the Australian people, for those people who deserve justice. There has to be justice. To say that it's only for the big end of town, if you've got the money to go to the courts—that's not the truth. The truth here is that we're talking about litigation funders. Let's talk the truth here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Litigation funders have been coming into this country, backed by people around the world who've put in the money. And do you know where they pick to do litigation funding? Australia: 'Go down under. They have a lot of litigation there—big payouts'. Statistics show that, historically, litigants who use litigation funders lose up to 50 per cent of any judgement awarded—50 per cent! I don't hear you talking about that. Not only that, but they're not registered here in Australia. They actually send the money to the Cayman Islands. We don't even get taxes out of them. They're only doing it for the profits, for the money in their pockets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We just had the litigation over robodebt. It was $1.2 billion. I wonder what they got out of that? How much did the Australian people get out of it? Have you spoken about that? Do you really care what the Australian people are getting out of it? No-one has really spoken about that. But I have been doing my research and talking to government about the Australian people getting money out of this. They're the ones who are hurting. And in my negotiations, in talking to the government, I have found that there is a minimum payout of 70 per cent, or even more, to others. But you're more worried about the litigation funders making their millions of dollars out of it. If they're represented by themselves, not by the litigation funders, they receive approximately 85 per cent of the awarded payouts. Isn't that important? Isn't that what this is all about? Don't we want to see a regulated industry here in Australia with this funding—that they are registered, that they are up-front, that they are going to represent the people, that it's not going to go into pockets around the world, to people who are not paying their taxes here in Australia? Isn't that what's important about all this? And don't say that they're not getting justice; there is justice. There will be justice, but they will be registered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Labor Party has a big interest in this, because of their firms: Slater and Gordon, Maurice Blackburn, and Shine—litigators. They take on these cases, because of the money. They get funded by litigation funders from around the world to take them on, to be the lawyers, and a deal's been done. So, they make a lot of money out of this, and I'm sure some of that money goes back into the Labor Party. There is self-interest here. That's what we need to stop, because these litigators can still represent the Australian people. Let the Australian people decide. If you allow non-profit organisations, people can go and represent themselves, and if they've got to be registered then so be it, because you don't want every Tom, Dick and Harry taking their cases to the courts; it's not feasible to do that. It has to be regulated in some way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to the government about this. I have no problem if it's held up—okay. The report was supposed to be brought down a lot sooner, earlier this year. We've had a hell of a year. It's been totally different to any other year, with COVID-19. Everything's been put on hold. But the fact is that this is moving forward. I'm not going to support this disallowance motion, because, in my working with the government, what I'm trying to do is bring forward an outcome for Australians where they will get a bigger payout—they are the ones that are hurting; not the litigation funders, not these lawyers that are making a lot of money out of it. They don't want to see the change. They're not interested. My position here is to look after the Australian people. It's quite interesting that Mark Dreyfus, a member in the other house, put out this tweet today:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">URGENT: The Senate votes today on whether to overturn the Government's move to deny access to justice to ordinary Australians, particularly farmers and households in rural &amp; regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where was the Labor Party and where was Mark Dreyfus when it was One Nation that pushed for the Select Committee on Lending to Primary Production Customers that we chaired? We listened to those farmers. We listened to those people. They were losing their land, being taken over by administrators and liquidators. That's why the royal commission came about. So how dare Mark Dreyfus raise this and say that we don't particularly care about the farmers? That's all I have ever talked about in this parliament: about the farmers and the man on the land. The tweet goes on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Will @PaulineHansonOz … stand with farmers or with the Liberals?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not about whether I'll stand with either one. I have always backed the farming sector in Australia. No-one can ever deny that. So I think it was a below-the-belt punch from Mark Dreyfus. There was no need for that at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sick and tired of getting bullied in this place and being told that I'm supposed to make decisions based on what you think is right—both sides of government here, whether it's Liberal or Labor; whoever is in government. Do you think you've made the right decisions? Do you think that you've never done wrong? The Labor Party stands up there and criticises the Liberal Party now, because it is in government. What the Labor Party has done has not been up to the standards of the Australian people either. The fact is that I will make decisions based on what I think is right for the people, and I won't be bullied by either side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My decisions will be based on what I think is right for the Australian people, and I will keep working with the government and pushing for the outcome that I want. I want a regulated industry where people have to be registered here in Australia—not litigation funders from overseas, who are funding it and getting millions and millions of dollars out of Australian people without paying Australian taxes. I also want the people who are awarded the money to get the money, not these rich lawyers—you know: 'Here comes another sucker; we're going to get as much as we can out of them.' That's who we should be supporting: the Australian people. That's why I will be continuing to work with the government so that this is dealt with, and it's the end of the year so I am hoping this is going to be dealt with ASAP. That's where I'm at. And I'll put it on the record in case you think this is the case—and it always gets thrown in my face by the Labor Party: what deals has she done?—no deals have been done. I don't do deals. I actually state the case. I research it, I look at it, and I make my decisions based on what I think is right for the people in this country. This is the way I'm going with it. Congratulations on all the work you've done, Senator O'Neill, but we will not be supporting you in this disallowance motion. I hope that next year we can celebrate, when changes are made to give fair and balanced—</span>

So this is a totally phoney and false debate. It is bizarre to hear the Greens and the Labor Party come in here and defend litigation funders who are generating 500, 600 or 700 per cent returns from cases, which they are then remitting to their headquarters in the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands or the Channel Islands—they're quite fond of islands!

I'd like to point out that we require a suburban financial planner with the most meagre of resources to have an AFS licence to practise in this country. It is a pretty basic requirement for operating as a financial services provider. The Federal Court had found that litigation funders were financial services providers and were required to have an AFS licence and be considered an MIS until Mr Bowen, as the financial services minister, issued a regulation of his own, Senator O'Neill—I know you have strong objections to regulations—to exempt them from that requirement. That was despite the fact that the courts had found that they were subject to it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to speak briefly to these. This morning we talked about judicial review, or the review associated with decisions made by the minister under this bill. The Senate has declined to include an AAT review process. So what these amendments together seek to do is to remove the prohibition in the bill for a review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and to require the minister to provide reasons for a decision. I just want to talk very briefly about that. The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act does not permit a merits review, which I think is one of the things that the minister is seeking to avoid—a discussion about the merits of a particular policy decision. Section 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act sets out the sorts of questions that can be brought before a court in relation to a decision, and they are things like:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) that procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(g) that the decision was induced or affected by fraud;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(h) that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are just several of the questions that can be put before a court. They are questions of law, not going to the merits of any particular decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is trying to find the balance and not overload the AAT with matters that typically would be initiated by fairly significant litigants—shire councils, state governments or universities. The AAT is more of a place for individual litigants who want to take on the government in respect of a decision that has been made about them personally. That's typically what happens in the AAT. But this does bring the level up to a court. That in itself will filter out the number of applications likely to be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An important part of that review process is that the minister is required to provide a decision. Now, it's generally accepted in administrative decision-making that decision-makers who are required to write down and set out the reasons generally make a better decision. But there are other reasons why people should be provided with reasons. In these circumstances, the minister may make a decision about an organisation, and that organisation may, in a sense, be aggrieved by the minister's decision. They've got a no on something—they're being prohibited from doing something, or something has been overturned—and they never get to understand why. That's one of the reasons why administrative decisions normally are accompanied with reasons, and that's so that the aggrieved party can have a look at those reasons.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third reason why it's important to have reasons made available—the first being so better decisions are made and the second being so the aggrieved party can see what the justification is—is that it actually provides a mechanism to initiate a judicial review of some sort. You can see what the minister has or has not done, and you can perhaps bring that to the attention of a court. The fourth reason is that in general, with any administrative decision, we like to see consistency in government. We like to see predictability in government. And if we have a number of decisions that are available for people to see, for people to understand and comprehend, then it allows others in the community to understand whether or not the actions they might be considering taking would fall foul of the minister's intent or not. So it is important to provide reasons, and it's for that reason I would encourage the Senate to vote for the amendments that I have put.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  Just to clarify in relation to the AD(JR) Act, which we went through in part earlier today, the government does not support these amendments, one of the reasons for that being the requirement to provide reasons. We also believe that there is substantial overlap between the scope of judicial review under the AD(JR) Act and the Constitution itself. That is the common law which is already available, of course, and the grounds for judicial review under the Judiciary Act and the AD(JR) Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is of the view that judicial review remains available under the foreign relations bill, as we have already discussed, by the Federal Circuit Court, under the Judiciary Act, and by the High Court, under the Constitution. And, like the AD(JR) Act, these avenues of review do allow a court to do several things, including setting aside a decision that has been unlawfully made, requiring the performance of what a decision-maker has failed to perform, ceasing proceedings where a decision-maker has failed to exercise their powers properly, and granting an injunction to prevent or require certain actions. So we do think the judicial review mechanism in the bill is appropriate. There are comparable schemes which also exclude the AD(JR) Act review on the basis that those schemes are ones which involve complex political considerations. That includes the FIRB; it includes, as I said earlier, certain decisions under the Passports Act, extradition and prisoner transfer arrangements; and it includes a range of other decisions relating to intelligence and national security, to taxation, to corporations and to charities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think it is appropriate to replace the foreign minister as the decision-maker on foreign policy and foreign relations with a merits review. These are the remit of the federal government. They draw from federal government expertise. We oppose these amendments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present—and is gravely to be regarded.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system—ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those words I just quoted were actually from a bloke by the name of Dwight Eisenhower, who said those words in his departing speech way back in 1961. I must admit that I was only put onto this part of the speech today. It's probably better known of course for his reference to the military-industrial complex.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I find amazing about this speech is just how prophetic it was in anticipating the problems of the conflict of interest between education for the sake of education and knowledge versus the need, obviously, for greater funding. This is such a well-known speech because Eisenhower predicted back in 1961 the threat of the military-industrial complex. A lot of people will say, 'Oh, here's Rennick again, putting on his silver tinfoil hat'. You can call me a right-wing nut job, but one person you can't call a right-wing nut job is the person who, in my view, was the greatest leader of the 20th century—Dwight Eisenhower. He led the invasion forces at D-day, he was the first supreme commander of NATO, he was the head of Columbia University and, of course, he was President of the United States for two terms. He oversaw a great era in American history. He built lots and lots of infrastructure, which just happens to be one of my favourite topics. I often wonder what he would think if he was alive today. He was worried then about the military-industrial complex. And today we have many industrial complexes—the superannuation industrial complex, the renewables industrial complex, the childcare industrial complex, the higher education industrial complex. There are so many vested interests in the role of government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last paragraph of that speech, Eisenhower said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the important things we have to do is stand up to our bureaucratic elite. In my view, they have gravely let us down in many, many ways. I want to touch on a couple of those issues briefly. The first one that really grinds my gears is the $430 billion defined-benefit superannuation liability. In this year's budget for the first time it was discounted by one per cent, so we got to see the true cost of this liability for our children. About one-third of that $430 billion is for the military. I have absolutely no problems with that. Our military deserve to be looked after in retirement. I am going to get these numbers confirmed if Treasury answer my questions on notice from estimates—and I had better get them—but the remaining $300 billion works out at over $1 million for every retired bureaucrat. Everyone says: 'You can't go back and change the defined benefit scheme because it's a violation of property rights.' I would disagree with that, because, in order to have a property right, you have to have a valid contract, and a valid contract requires an offer and an acceptance. There was never an offer by the elite to the people that said: 'We want to pay ourselves a golden handshake, a defined benefit pension, that's going to cost you over $1 million per person.' That is just one example of how our bureaucrats are part of this technological elite and how, in my view, they have overused their powers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:32</span>):  Tonight I rise to make some remarks about the Liberal Party in Western Australia—the state opposition—and the ongoing and significant risk they pose to the health and wellbeing of Western Australians. Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Western Australia so far, the Liberal opposition has, every step of the way, sought to undermine the efforts of the McGowan Labor government—no team spirit here, no putting the science or the epidemiology first. They've called again and again for the borders to be opened, siding not only with federal colleagues here but also with Clive Palmer in trying to use the courts to bring Western Australia's border down. This is the same Clive Palmer who made attempts to bankrupt Western Australia with a $30 billion damages claim. It's not really surprising that the Liberals are associated with this, given their history of reckless spending when they were in control of the Western Australian government's finances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liza Harvey, perhaps under pressure from her WA Liberal colleagues, repeatedly called for Western Australia's hard border to be scrapped. That hard border was there for no reason other than to keep Western Australian citizens safe through this global pandemic. We know that the border closure has had an effect on families, that it has been tough and that it has had an impact on jobs and livelihoods. But it was a lot less tough than losing loved ones to COVID-19 and a lot less tough than a pandemic with untold economic consequences, as we are seeing elsewhere around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in Western Australia, it seems at last that the faceless men in the Liberal Party of WA have understood the mood in the room, they have understood the mood of the public and they have overthrown Liza Harvey. They have thrown out Liza Harvey, who, despite all her faults on policy and understanding the Western Australian sentiment and mood, was an experienced operator with real-life experience who had been in government before. So who did Nick Goiran and Peter Collier leave themselves as picks for the Western Australian Liberal Party leadership? On the one hand, we had an untested leader on training wheels or, on the other, an incompetent former minister who had displayed bad judgement again and again. WA Liberals wanted the borders down in the height of the pandemic, and the shadow health minister, who now is the leader of the Liberal Party in WA, was responsible for that policy. They have selected in the WA Liberal Party the very man who was the shadow health minister who endorsed the call for the borders to come down. So it doesn't really matter, I say to the chamber tonight, who the leader of the WA Liberal Party is: you can see from those backroom dynamics that the risk is the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, I have no trust that they won't continue to undermine the efforts of the McGowan Labor government, a McGowan Labor government that has kept the state safe and strong. Thanks to the considered and strong leadership of the McGowan government, WA has recorded this year the strongest growth of any state—that is, 1.4 per cent—and that is even despite the pandemic in the final quarter of that financial year. That's because of Labor's strong leadership in WA. We know that from Tuesday 8 December families will be able to be reunited with loved ones from all over the place, including Victoria and New South Wales. We are wishing those in South Australia all the best in getting the pandemic under control there so that we can welcome them to the state. We cannot risk another WA Liberal government. We want a strong and experienced premier that we can trust—Mark McGowan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  Twelve days ago, a full bench of the Federal Court, 3-0, brought to an end three years of desperate 'lawfare' by the Australian Workers Union in its attempt to shut down an investigation by the Registered Organisations Commission into alleged unauthorised use of AWU members' money by its former national secretary Mr Shorten. The AWU lost on every single issue of fact and issue of law it had pursued. This matter can now be very easily settled. Indeed, the AWU National Secretary, Daniel Walton, promised to release all documents once the legal process was completed, even if the union lost the current court case. It lost; it should release the documents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The allegations facing Mr Shorten and the AWU and those that faced Craig Thomson and the HSU are disturbingly similar. Craig Thomson used money to finance his campaign for the seat of Dobell. Mr Shorten allegedly used AWU members' money to finance his run. Mr Thomson used money to make donations to what he considered worthy causes with which he was associated. Mr Shorten allegedly used union money to make donations to GetUp, of which he was a board member at the time. Mr Thomson was found to have breached sections 285, 286 and 287 of the registered organisations legislation, the same sections which Mr Shorten and the AWU continue to stand accused of breaching. In 2015 Justice Jessup found that Mr Thomson had used the money of the union without national executive authorisation. The same allegation is made against Mr Shorten. No wonder Mr Shorten threatened to defund the ROC if Labor won the last election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2007 Mr Shorten used AWU money to employ an individual to work on his own campaign. This was one of the breaches for which Mr Thomson was found guilty. Justice Jessup found that to use the services of the campaign worker for his own purposes was the 'clearest of improprieties'. The questionable AWU transactions include donations totalling $150,000 to GetUp, which GetUp should of course repay. GetUp's lack of integrity will see them cling on to these funds and disregard the AWU memberships' entitlement. Labor has continually asserted that the ROC's investigation is nothing more than a fishing exercise through historic paperwork to find any kind of error—not a crime, an error. Justice Jessup, in the HSU case, strongly disagreed with such arguments, describing using money without authorisation as a 'conspicuous impropriety' and an 'unthinkable' breach of the duties of an office holder of a union. These are not small amounts. The impugned donations from the AWU totalled around $230,000. The amount that Justice Jessup found Mr Thomson had misappropriated was a lesser $184,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not deterred by the failure of the court challenge, the AWU took to Twitter a month ago to describe the ROC's inquiry into the AWU as a witch-hunt. I remind listeners that Justice Bromberg completely shredded such claims by the AWU. His honour stated that the AWU had not presented any evidence or even suggested a case concept or narrative that provided a motive for the knowing and deliberate conduct that it ascribed to the ROC. Justice Bromberg found the AWU refused to cooperate with the most straightforward of requests for information by the ROC. It seems shiftiness and evasion are characteristics that are handed down the line of succession for national secretaries of the AWU. I commend the officers of the ROC for their commitment to achieving justice for the membership of the AWU, whose money has been allegedly used as a personal slush fund. Labor's vicious, personal and nasty attacks on these officers are unbecoming, now proven to be false and undertaken simply to distract from the issue at hand: AWU members' funds being misused by officials. Watch this space as justice ultimately prevails.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  The Christmas season is nearly here. Of course, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Australians will be buying gifts online this year. Many will be using Amazon Australia for the first time, a company with an extremely concerning record on taxation, environmentalism and workplace rights. In 2019, Amazon's retail arm made $562 million in Australia but only paid $2.5 million in income tax for that year—that's an income tax rate of 0.4 per cent. At the same time, the personal net worth of Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, was a whopping $185 billion. It's disgusting that any person should earn so much, while his company fails to contribute to taxes around the world. It's worse that billionaires like Jeff Bezos have earned so much during COVID, while our income for the community's hospitals, education and security misses out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The company's record on workplace rights is also deeply alarming. Warehouse workers across Europe were shocked to learn last week that Amazon had hired the notorious Pinkerton agency to gather intelligence on union activities, including going undercover as spies on Polish warehouses. In the United States, Amazon released a training video to managers teaching them how to identify warning signs of union activity. Workers have been sacked for speaking out about company failings surrounding COVID-19. This kind of Big Brother behaviour has no place in modern society. And this grubby company should be held to account for their practices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amazon's reliance on insecure work is another deeply concerning issue. Currently, the SDA and their state secretary in New South Wales, Bernie Smith, is supporting an Amazon worker who will soon be in the Federal Court pursuing their rights. Amazon led one of their labour hire employees to believe that, because of her diligent work, she would become a permanent employee of the company, directly employed by Amazon. Then she told Amazon that she was pregnant. She said that she would be giving birth by Christmas—something that should be a joyous time for a young mother. But, of course, suddenly the job disappeared. Amazon will say it was not about that; they will say it is about some other flimsy excuse, but we do know the truth. Unionised workplaces don't get away with this. That's why these companies resort to casualisation and anti-union behaviour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amazon, of course, has big ambitions in Australia. They plan to make $23 billion a year in retail revenue from their Australian operations by the end of this decade. They will be larger than Qantas, Lendlease and Macquarie Group and almost the size of Telstra. But we know their business model—dodge paying tax, bust up the workers' voice, sack any staff who raise concerns and pollute the environment. This is why I am urging others, including politicians here, to join unionists, the Transport Workers Union and the shop assistants union, religious figures and activists around the world to support a campaign called Make Amazon Pay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make Amazon Pay is an international movement to ensure that Amazon does the right thing by communities and its employees. This movement says that Amazon can absolutely afford to pay its fair share in Australian taxes; Amazon can absolutely afford to pay its workforce appropriately, including sick leave and adequate breaks; and Amazon has no right to import anti-union activities, American activities, into its business-community-busting strategies—a rapacious business model that puts profits over people. When it comes to workers' wages, Amazon rips them off. When it comes to owner-operators and contractors, Amazon rips them off. Amazon is one big rip-off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government can make a difference right now by legislating for rights for contract labour and digital taxation. The choice for the government is whether they stand with businesses that pay their taxes and pay their workers or whether they stand by rip-off merchants like Amazon. It's time to make Amazon pay. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:47</span>):  I would like to speak tonight about the recent tragic deaths and serious injuries of food delivery workers in Sydney and across the country. We have seen a tragedy unfolding on our streets over the last few months. At least five delivery riders have been killed on the roads since the end of September. Four of those deaths were in Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been warning for years about the precarious and dangerous nature of exploitative work in the so-called gig economy. Operating outside the ordinary rules and parameters of our industrial relations systems, companies like Uber Eats, Menulog and Deliveroo profit hugely off the back of drivers and riders, who are often paid well below minimum wage and who put up with dangerous conditions that would be completely unacceptable in other industries. Riders have to work themselves to exhaustion in order to make enough money to eat, and their pay has reportedly been cut during the pandemic. Moreover, these companies do not check basic things like: Does this person know how to ride a bike safely? Is the bike in good condition? Does it need repairs or is it roadworthy at all? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mentality behind gig economy work forces workers to bear all responsibility and risk when it comes to their ability to get home safely at the end of the day. The company wipes its hands of it. It is disgusting and an unfathomable business model. New figures revealed by SBS over the weekend show that 65 safety incidents involving food delivery platforms have been reported to SafeWork NSW in the last 12 months. The Transport Workers Union says this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. We cannot ignore the reality that many of these delivery drivers are migrant workers and international students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March and April the government drew up its COVID income support measures and made a decision to exclude temporary visa holders from the coronavirus supplement and the JobKeeper wage subsidy. We put forward proposals, right here in this chamber, that would have extended income support to international students and other temporary visa holders, but sadly this did not get support from the government. This decision has forced many into dangerous work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' approach stood in sharp contrast to countries such as the UK, Canada and New Zealand, where visa holders were eligible for income support. The Treasurer said that, when providing the COVID safety net, the government 'had to draw a line somewhere'. The Prime Minister infamously told international students to go home. But students did not go home. The latest data from September shows that the vast majority of international students and other visa holders stayed in Australia. And they remain in Australia. This shouldn't have come as a surprise. The pandemic continues to rage on across the world. Borders have remained closed. And, perhaps most crucially, many of these people have made it home here, so where should they go and why should they go?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they do have to make a living. When jobs evaporated earlier this year, without income support many visa holders turned to the gig economy. In its recent submission to the New South Wales parliamentary inquiry into future work, major food delivery company Deliveroo stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Deliveroo saw a surge in applications from people who wanted to become riders during the COVID-19 crisis. Hundreds of riders were onboarded nationally between April and mid August.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These migrant workers might be invisible to you all sitting here but they are real people who live here. They do the jobs that no-one else will. They keep the economy going. Poor industrial conditions have been rightly identified as largely responsible for the danger of food delivery work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Laws must be overhauled at both state and federal level to provide the better pay, good conditions and protections that these workers deserve. But the brutal reality is that the federal government's decision to exclude migrant workers from COVID-19 support should also be attributed some blame. It gives me no pleasure here to label that decision racist and deadly. It's not too late to make changes. Federal income support measures should be immediately extended to all temporary visa holders. My thoughts are with the delivery riders and drivers, who continue to needlessly suffer within this industry. I extend my condolences and thoughts to the families, friends and loved ones of the drivers who have been killed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  In Australia we have a health star rating system, which is a system designed to help consumers make healthier choices. It is a system of good intent. Currently, there are over 10,300 packaged foods and drinks in Australia that have a health star rating label on the package. The system is designed to compare like for like: dairy products, packaged foods and non-dairy beverages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the rating system these products are given a rating based on their nutritional profile according to a strict calculation called the Health Star Rating Calculator. The integrity of this calculator is paramount to the integrity of the system. If we get it right, it has great potential to aid consumers. If we get it wrong, it can be absolutely misleading. I will give you an example. If one beverage product had on its ingredient list carbonated water, colouring, acidity regulators, sweeteners, preservatives, caffeine and natural flavours, and another beverage product had on its ingredient list natural fibres and vitamins A, B6, C, thiamine, folate, calcium, magnesium and potassium, which would you choose as a healthier choice? I know from my position that I'd choose the one with the vitamins and not the one with the numbers. But if we get the calculator wrong under the Health Star Rating system because of the protein, fat, carbohydrate and sugar content of the two products, then the product with the fibre, vitamin C and minerals may come in with a lower Health Star Rating than the other one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those two products I compared were diet cola and 100-per-cent orange juice. When I talk to parents who want to do the right thing by their children, they would acknowledge that orange juice is a healthier choice than cola. Thankfully, most parents don't rely wholly and solely on the Health Star Rating but it does show how dangerous it is if we don't get the calculator right. We must ensure that the calculator does as intended, which is to base its ratings on a combination of assessing the total energy, saturated fat, sodium and sugar content as well as the fibre, protein, fruit, vegetable, nut and legume content. It must consider all of those, because in that way it will consider the nutrition of the product and not just the salt and sugar content.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This system is not just about health; it's also about our valuable citrus fruit and beverage industries in Australia. There are 1,900 Australian citrus growers across our country and they support 5,000 full-time equivalent jobs. A lot of that product goes into our high-quality, fresh 100-per-cent Australian fruit juice, and I'm not just talking about orange juice. We have apple juice, which is so important to the apple growers around Batlow in my state, and across Tasmania, and other high-quality, healthy fresh fruit and vegetable juices that we produce in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Citrus Australia CEO, Nathan Hancock, has said that their growers would be gutted if they were told that their fresh, high-quality 100-per-cent juice products were of lesser health value than diet cola. We need to ensure that our Health Star Rating system maintains its integrity in Australia. I call on the council of food ministers across Australia and New Zealand to ensure that the calculator has integrity, remains robust and considers fruit, vegetable, nut and legume content as well as the other factors to ensure that we are promoting healthy choices.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:57</span>):  Yesterday, Tuesday 1 December, was a somewhat special day to some but not to others. Seventy-eight years ago on the same day, Ordinary Seaman Edward 'Teddy' Sheean went down with his ship, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">dale</span>, losing his life at the age of 18, with so much of his life unlived and sadness and tragedy for his family, friends and loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, Teddy's family, after all that time, received into their hands the VC which was finally awarded to Teddy. Teddy died as he strapped himself to an Oerlikon gun. In an act of gallantry, he chose certain death to ensure that his comrades had a chance to live. HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> had been hit by two torpedoes and a bomb from the air. Ordinary Seaman Teddy Sheean disobeyed the order to abandon ship and fired back at the Japanese aircraft. He was wounded in the chest and in the back but continued to fire, shooting down one bomber and keeping the other aircraft away. He was seen, still firing the gun, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> sank. Forty-nine of the 149 of his shipmates who had been on board survived. The citation for his Victoria Cross says that his pre-eminent act of valour and most conspicuous gallantry saved Australian lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teddy's nephew Garry Ivory accepted the medal from the Governor-General in a quiet ceremony in Canberra yesterday. Mr Ivory has campaigned tirelessly for 32 years for his uncle's bravery to be recognised. Congratulations to Mr Ivory and to all those involved for the many, many hours and years that they've put in to ensure that Teddy was recognised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teddy was born in 1923 in Lower Barrington, a small rural village near Latrobe, just a few kilometres south-east of my office in Devonport. In Latrobe there's a memorial, and a lovely walk through an avenue of honour along a peaceful path all the way to the lovely Bells Parade. It's named the Sheean Walk. I spent some time there a few months ago to reflect on the sacrifice that Teddy made for his country. I'm sure that the sun is shining brighter at Sheean Walk today. All Tasmanians—in fact, all Australians—are very proud to call Edward 'Teddy' Sheean, VC, one of our own.</span>
