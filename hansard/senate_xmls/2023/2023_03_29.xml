              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Birmingham moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the consideration of the Productivity Commission Amendment (Electricity Reporting) Bill 2023.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that as soon as this debate concludes we will move on to the Australian Greens' private senators' time, as scheduled in the normal routine of business. That private senators' time has been respected, notwithstanding the variation of hours motion that was pushed through by the government yesterday. Remarkably though there was another version of the variation of hours motion pushed through by the government yesterday. The initially circulated version also would have reserved private senators' time for opposition business tomorrow morning, during which time the Productivity Commission Amendment (Electricity Reporting) Bill 2023 was to be considered. Before it came to be voted on, a second version of the government's hours variation motion came through. Lo and behold, in the second version the opposition's private senators' time got knocked out. So the Greens' private senators' time was preserved for today but the opposition's private senators' time was eliminated for tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the way in which this Senate chamber should be treated. An important principle of this Senate chamber is that across the chamber there is respect for non-government business having an opportunity to be considered and debated. That respect should be extended to all non-government parties, not just to those whom the government chooses to do deals with. It is one thing for the government to have done its deal on the safeguard legislation with the Greens. Of course, we're waiting to see the full extent of the amendments. The substantial amendments weren't available as we debated the bill through until after 4 am. We still did not get to see the amendments that actually deliver that deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also dealt away the usual proceedings and courtesies of private senators' time in this place. Remarkably, despite reasonable approaches from Senator Ruston and the opposition, they have not agreed to reinstate that. It wouldn't have changed the deadline, the hard marker, that actually sees the conclusion of the safeguard legislation. That's already established. The motion before the Senate would not change that deadline. It would simply reinstate the opportunity for Senator Duniam's bill, the Productivity Commission Amendment (Electricity Reporting) Bill 2023, to be called on in the normal, ordinary routine of business, at 9 am tomorrow morning, to be considered for the normal, ordinary routine one hour and 10 minutes tomorrow morning as private senators' time ordinarily would be. There is nothing but routine in what the opposition is proposing here. It should not take a suspension of standing orders motion for us to ask for the routine, for us to ask for normal courtesies to be extended. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Duniam's bill is a straightforward one. It deserves to be debated. It deserves even more to be debated in the context of the safeguard mechanism that this chamber is considering. Because Senator Duniam's bill will bring greater transparency to electricity price reporting. It will bring greater scrutiny to the way in which energy markets and electricity prices are considered. It's a very important proposal, given the other matters that are before this Senate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would urge the Greens, who are about to have their one hour and 10 minutes of private senators' time this morning, to reflect and provide the same—</span>

                  </a>  We're not taking their time. They are still going to get one hour and 10 minutes, Senator Gallagher. That is the one hour and ten minutes guaranteed in the way in which it is established. It's not a hard marker that changes this. The Greens will still get their one hour and ten minutes. We were considerate and actually thought of that before moving this suspension motion. I urge the Greens to show similar courtesy to other non-government parties. The Labor party may not be willing to show those courtesies, but to show similar courtesies to other non-government parties, so we can receive the same opportunity for private senators' time as you are receiving. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would certainly urge those across the crossbench to think about the fact that they ought to provide for this, because at some stage it could happen to them. So indeed, to Senators Lambie and Tyrrell, to Senator David Pocock, to the One Nation senators Hanson and Roberts, I urge all of them to support this motion, because it does nothing but ensure the normal proceedings proceed. </span>

This is a tactic to delay getting to safeguards, firstly. You worked out you can eat in half an hour of time, and then we will go to private senators' business and then we'll get to safeguards and then you'll delay through committee stage.

                  </a>  Most disorderly. I know we've all been here and we're going to be scratchy today, but I've only got a couple of minutes. If we make good progress—that is, if we are dealing with the amendments and we're not just having a long filibuster from all of those opposite—then we are very open to facilitating private senators' time tomorrow morning. But we are not in a position to make that decision now, because, if we see what we've been advised we will see, you will just take that time tomorrow to delay dealing with safeguards again. So I think it's very reasonable, now that the Senate has expressed a view on the hours motion—which we did when we passed it yesterday—that, if we are able to provide that hour tomorrow and still allow people to put their amendments and have a debate over those amendments, we give you our commitment that we will facilitate that, as a sign of good faith. But we're not at that position yet, because we don't know how today is going to roll.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If last night was any kind of measure of how we're going to do that, it's not looking that crash-hot, to be honest. So I would say to those opposite: work with us, even though we accept that you oppose the bill and think the sky is going to fall in and all of what we heard last night. Work with us to facilitate the committee stage, and then there will be no concern at all about private senators' time being facilitated by the government tomorrow. The Senate has taken a view on the motion yesterday that we want to prioritise this bill. We want it put through. We had to put some management around it because we knew that this was not going to be smoothly facilitated through the parliament. No matter how many hours we put on it, we would have been seeing delaying tactics from those opposite. We saw that in the strength of the second reading remarks last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said: engaging with us on the hours motion didn't happen; delaying getting to safeguards today is not a good sign of where we're going to end up; and, if we get to where we need to get to at a reasonable time tonight, then there is no issue. We will absolutely, totally and very happily facilitate private senators' time for the opposition tomorrow. But we also need to make sure that we deal with this bill, that everyone has the opportunity to put their amendments and to have their say, and that we are able to deal with that by 1 pm tomorrow. I think changing the motion in advance of that will put at risk an orderly passage of that bill.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. The Greens will not be able to support the suspension, but I do accept that in this place we do need to be able to provide space for non-government senators to have a debate on issues that are important to them. I would urge the Leader of the Opposition and his frontbench team to consider the offer from the government to help facilitate in an orderly manner the safeguard bill's committee stage over the next 12 hours, and then hopefully we can get to a position where, tomorrow, private senators' time can be reinstated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's absolutely essential to ensure that the Senate does have time for private senators' space and debate. It's a fundamental part of this chamber. But what I've seen over the last 24 hours is delay after delay after delay—tactics to put off the safeguard legislation. This is just like what we saw for the last decade when the coalition was in government—delay after delay after delay on taking action on the climate crisis. We can't continue to put that at risk. That is why we put in place a routine of business in this chamber, and we should stick to that. If there is opportunity to amend it for tomorrow morning, I'm very open to it, and I'm happy to keep talking with the opposition about that. It's why I won't support the suspension now but I am happy to consider the motion later in the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would also point this out to anyone who is listening: if you want to know what the opposition's view is on the world, go back and listen to some of the speeches that were in here at 3 am this morning, because there's not an awful lot of thought or intellect coming from some people on the benches on this side. All they are doing is saying, 'The sky is falling in.' The tinfoil hat brigade is out, and the mouthpiece for the coal and gas industry was in full swing. The lunacy of some of the claims that were being made in the early hours of this morning in some regards would be laughable, but we're talking about the survival of the planet. We're talking about the climate and environment crisis that we are in. We have members from the other side who, rather than taking action, for years—for decades—have held back climate action in this country and are still dragging their knuckles along the ground, hoping that someone is listening.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:16</span>):  I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Birmingham. It's a very simple motion. Genuinely, for those of you who believe in democracy and in the orderly running of the chamber, and for those of you who are not members of the government, this is all about you, as Senator Birmingham said. This is not about the opposition. Yes, the motion is in relation to our private senators' time tomorrow, but this is not about the opposition; this is about the proper functioning of this chamber. This is about ensuring that those who are not in government—I was going to say that includes the Australian Greens, but that would be to reject what I just said myself: 'Good God! It is currently the green tail wagging the red dog.' I withdraw that comment. This is actually about the proper functioning of the chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a lot of talk today about the fact that we are trying to delay the passage of the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2023. Let us be very clear. Senator Birmingham's motion has nothing to do with the passage of that bill. We sat until 4.13 am this morning. It is now 9.17 am. We were happy to sit all the way through last night and all the way into this morning to ensure that we all had an adequate opportunity to give a speech in the second reading debate on this. We are more than happy—in fact, I expect there's a good chance that we will be here tomorrow at this time as we proceed through the committee stage. Again, this bill will pass. A deal has been done. But this is an incredibly important bill that deserves to be questioned. But, at the same time, that does not mean that you throw out democracy. That does not mean that you just throw away the Senate Order of Business and say: 'We'll dispose of that. We won't allow those who are not in government an opportunity to actually raise an issue.' It's only a short opportunity—it's only one hour and ten minutes—to raise and properly debate a very important bill that has been put forward by Senator Duniam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I challenge anyone in this place to say that private senators' time is not an important part of a Senate sitting week. For those of us who care about democracy—and I hope that is each and every one of us in this place, but I have to say that, if Senator Birmingham's motion is not supported, those who are voting no may want to question whether or not they do believe that this place should operate in a democratic manner—we do need to see adequate time set aside for private senators' business. Yesterday that appeared to be okay, and then suddenly it all changed. The dirty deal was done, the Greens got what they wanted. It's okay if it's the Greens private senators' time. I challenge the Greens: can you give us your private senators' time today? There you go. Then we will argue if you want to lose your private senators' time tomorrow. Gosh! I bet that wouldn't happen. Why? Because the deal has been done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things the Australian parliament and the Australian Senate do is make and change laws. The government obviously gets its chance to introduce bills. We debate those bills, sometimes not in a timely fashion, unfortunately, or with adequate time, but the opposition and others who are not in government get limited opportunity to bring forward matters that are of importance to them. That is what private senators' time is all about. That is why it is not good enough for the government of the day, in conjunction with the green tail wagging the red dog, to ride roughshod over the processes of the Senate. This is all about good process. This is all about ensuring that those who are not in government—excluding the Australian Greens because, technically, they are in government, given the fact they will jump shortly and they will have an opportunity of one hour and 10 minutes this morning to debate a matter that is of importance to them. I may not agree the matter is of importance, but it's private senators' time, and they have a right to debate their business, just as I would have thought any other person not in government had a right that is about to be denied to them, to ensure the proper functioning of this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:21</span>):  I rise to support the suspension motion and the right of every single senator to have their say, for dissenting voices to be expressed in this chamber. I remind senators on all sides of this chamber that that is supposed to be what the Senate is actually about. It is where the diversity of the views that exist within our democracy have a space and a place to be expressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have heard this morning, in speaking to this suspension motion, is that some voices, some senators, some views are more equal than others under the new regime of the Labor Party and the Greens in government. We accept the deal has been done. The legislation will be passed. We also accept that that means we have to stay up till 4 am to make contributions. Senators from the National Party and the Liberal Party did that last night and were happy to do so because it is important that the views we bring to the debate on this legislation be said, heard and reflected upon so that when the implications of this decision are felt in the communities that we've been sent to represent—are felt in a very real and tangible way in job losses and in skyrocketing energy prices, particularly in rural and regional Australia—it's important that we have done the right thing by our communities and have put it on the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To come here and have a deal to mean that democracy doesn't matter anymore in the Senate, that the Greens can have their special place in the sun but other non-government senators and parties can't, is an absolute flouting of what this chamber was set up to do, which is to provide for our democracy. Behaviour like that is commonplace in the other place. It's a very blunt instrument: I've got the numbers; you don't. We get to do whatever we like. But this has always been the chamber of negotiation. It has always been the chamber of diversity of views and respecting the fact that, no matter how far apart we are on the substantive question, we all have the right and, indeed, the duty to express that in this place. The increasing pattern of behaviour from the government, supported by their coalition partner the Greens, is to shut down dissent and to silence diversity so there really is only one view able to be expressed out of the Australian Senate. We have processes in place to facilitate both the passage of bills and the expression of the diverse views of the Australian people. Minister, your government, enabled by the Greens, has sought to shut those diverse views down when you don't have to. This chamber is now hostage. We've been gagged, we've been dragged and now we're being held to ransom for our views and are being silenced along the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to back away, nor is my team going to back away, from bringing very real questions that Minister Farrell couldn't answer about the impact of this deal on rural and regional Australians, on our industries and on the 84 per cent of companies that are actually going to be impacted by the safeguard mechanism. We've got a lot of questions to ask. That is our job. We are all on the journey to net zero, but you're kidding yourself if you think the impact of that decision is going to be felt the same across our country and the same across our communities. Our job on this side of the chamber is to understand the implication of the decision. Holding us hostage—gagging and dragging us, ransoming our right as senators and how this chamber has functioned in my entire 12 years here, no matter who's been in government—is a very concerning precedent and pattern of behaviour from the Labor Party.</span>

It is not to be used to bludgeon people into compliance to vote in a certain way. It is not a weapon. Democracy requires a voice. We are elected to be the voice of our constituents. How can we be shut down? This is the end of democracy if we do not support Senator Birmingham's motion. Everyone on the crossbench needs to realise we could be next. This is a very dangerous precedent, and that's why I will be supporting Senator Birmingham's motion. But I disagree with Senator McKenzie, because I don't think behaviour is always respectful in this place. I don't think it's necessarily genuine. There are far too many stunts. Nonetheless, complying with the Labor Party in using this as a weapon is something we will not condone. We will be voting with Senator Birmingham.</span>

The absolute arrogance of those opposite—to think they can come in here and say to us, if we behave ourselves today, we might be able to get some treats tomorrow and have our private senators time—is not the way a respectful democracy operates. It is absolutely shameful that you would be so condescending and so arrogant as to treat this chamber as your toy, your plaything with which you can do as you please.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is the pattern of behaviour we're going to see going forward from the government around their arrogance, that they will just gag whatever they like, and the ridiculousness of the conversation and the contribution of Senator Gallagher, that somehow we were cutting into time—you guys have put the gag in. You already have the approval of this chamber. You've got the gag in place. It will be completed tomorrow at one o'clock no matter what we debate between now and then.

I would suggest the reason you're not providing us with those amendments now is that you know they're going to expose the full extent of your dirty deal with the Greens to get this bill through this place. We already know from the conversations we've seen in the papers, the comments by Mr Bandt in the other place, about the fact he's going to shut down 116 coal and gas projects that are in the pipeline, and yet Mr Bowen tells us: 'Oh no, nothing's going to happen here. It's all going to be fine. This is not going to disrupt everything. This is just a nice little tweak that'll mean that we've, all of a sudden, got our emissions targets met in five minutes.'

I would actually suggest you reflect on this, because the deal you've done with the devil actually makes you part of the devil's clan in this instance. You've now signed yourself up to saying that it's okay for you to actually take advantage of something, but you will deny the rest of the non-government senators in this place that same privilege.

With respect to the Greens, I did ask them if they would support us in having an equitable reinstatement of private senators' time. I thought I did it in a respectful way, and I'm disappointed that Senator Hanson-Young would come in here and suggest in some way that I wasn't respectful. I think I've always been respectful in my dealings with you, Senator Hanson-Young.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In beginning the debate on the Greens bill to require a vote before our troops are deployed overseas, I want to first acknowledge that we are gathered here, in this place, on the unceded sovereign lands of the Ngunnawal and the Ngambri people, to pay respect to their elders and to acknowledge that that sovereignty, fundamentally, has never been ceded. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Though unceded, the Ngunnawal and the Ngambri share with all First Nations people a continued violation of that sovereignty that began at the moment of invasion, at the moment of the beginning of the war for the conquest of this nation. It was a war whose battlefront swept from Western Australia and the massacres of Pinjarra through to the black lines of Tasmania, a war whose massacre sites, whose battle sites, whose internment camps, were then turned into holiday destinations for those who declared themselves the victors. It was a war that sat back and allowed the names of those who participated in it, who perpetrated the massacres, to be elevated to the highest station and to be placed upon the streets and place names that the colonisers then built. This is the first war and the original sin of the colonial Australian nation and, as we begin this debate on matters of war and peace, it is only right to establish this debate in that fundamental foundation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty years on from the war in Iraq and the wars in Afghanistan and 50 years on from the Vietnam War, with the deaths of millions of civilians—overwhelmingly people of colour, dead as a result of wars started by rich white men for the purposes of maintaining rich white power—and with thousands of Australian Defence Force personnel lost, wounded or struggling, to this day, with the impact of war, it is only right that Australians are asking why a Prime Minister alone should continue to be allowed to have the sole power to send our forces overseas without first seeking a vote of this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This question is particularly relevant given that, again and again, we have seen prime ministers join in with US wars because it suited their interests. We have seen, again and again, prime ministers lie to the community about what we were really fighting for and whether there was another way. These are important questions for any democracy. Any democracy should be able to ask them and seek answers to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the most basic commitment to the principle of democracy should lead decision-makers to the conclusion that such a significant decision should be subject to a vote, as it is in so many other nations. But in Australia this decision is kept close by the leaders of the major parties. The Australian government deliberately keeps this decision as far away from the public as possible, to protect those in power from any form of accountability for the decisions they make and the decisions our community have to live with and suffer through. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both parties, over decades, have made use of legal loopholes and flimsy interpretations to wage wars that have led to some of the most severe and devastating humanitarian consequences. In the war in Afghanistan there were over 200,000 killed, including 41 members of the Australian armed forces. There was the illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq, which claimed the lives of half a million people, displaced 1.2 million—to this day—and created five million orphans. It also took the lives of four ADF personnel and wounded a further 27. The Vietnam War and the illegal bombing of Laos and Cambodia resulted in millions of dead in those nations, including 500 ADF personnel. Our ally, the United States, dropped more bombs on the tiny country of Vietnam in that war than it did during the entire Second World War.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each one of these wars has one thing in common—they lacked a clear objective or a strategy, and it was the ordinary people of all nations that suffered. Those responsible for making those decisions were never held accountable nor forced to properly explain or account for their actions. And, particularly in the case of Iraq, the Australian community was united. Ninety-two per cent of the Australian community was united. We marched together, hundreds of thousands in capital cities across this ancient continent as part of the largest human protests in the history of our species, because we knew we were being lied to. We knew that Howard was lying, we knew that Bush was lying, we knew that Blair was lying and we did not want to see our children go and die in their war. Yet, in this country, because of the collusion of both major parties, the power to go to war is held solely by the executive. The people gathered in their righteous might were unable to translate that force into a democratic outcome, because both of you had worked together for decades to make sure that couldn't happen. So we were dragged to war based on a lie and we bore the cost and the people of Iraq bore the cost. ADF personnel and their families to this day are picking up the pieces. They're trying to put their lives back together, while the politicians who sent them to war live lavishly on pensions and are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to give speeches about leadership when they themselves refuse to this day to face the effect of the decisions that they made or to be held accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to this chamber that, if a mum has to be kept up all night in bed worrying about their child who is to this day deployed in Iraq as part of Operations Okra or Operations Accordion, even though their child isn't old enough to even remember who Saddam Hussein was, then the parliament should be held responsible for sending them there. If mums and dads, family members and friends have to do that stress, bear that burden, every single day, never knowing whether that knock at the door will be the dreaded knock or that phone call will be the dreaded phone call, then the least the politicians who sent them there can do is be willing to vote on that decision, take accountability on that decision, sit on a damn side and declare, 'I thought this was a good idea, and, if you disagree, then you can challenge me,' rather than hiding behind the vagaries created by this executive club.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time that Australia joined the ranks of so many other democracies and gave the right to vote on whether the parliament should go to war to the actual parliament itself so that the parliament and its members can be held responsible for the decision that they make, so that the Australian people can hold each and every one of them accountable at the ballot box for the decisions they decide to make. If they lie, as they have lied, they can be challenged by their electorates and voted out of office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in the 21st century. The challenges of this century are the challenges of climate change. They are the challenges of public health. They are the challenges of ensuring that every human being has access to education, access to health care, access to a roof over their head. They are very different to the challenges of previous times. Yet we see in this place both sides participating in the escalation of tensions, creating a reality in our region where the coming of conflict is more likely. Australia and the Australian community must always work to de-escalate these tensions and, above all, prevent those in positions of power putting Australian people at risk because a war suits their political ends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that many in the Labor Party support this reform but are worried about breaking the party line. I know that very many members of the Labor Party support this Greens reform and wish that their members of parliament would act in unity with them and demonstrate the courage that they so dearly wish to see. To those worried about the impact of breaking the party line this morning, I want to ask you a question. Do you really want to give Peter Dutton the unilateral power to declare war? Do you really think that is a good idea? We can fix this right here—here this morning—by supporting this Greens bill today and stop the risk of another illegal war just 20 years after we engaged in the last one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing I want to say, because I can hear ticking over, in the minds of those who will now come to speak, a couple of myths that are fed to you from different PMs and deputy PMs' offices and the opposition leader's office. I can hear it right now. They're about to say, 'What about in the case of an urgent, unexpected escalation of tension where our waters might be incurred into?' Let me counter that one, before you even rattle it off from your speaking notes. Our bill makes specific provision for a circumstance in which our territorial waters were incurred into. In that situation no vote of the parliament would be required. This bill deals exclusively with the deployment of ADF personnel beyond our territorial waters. So before you give us that claptrap, I will put that on the record. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  I rise to speak on this private senator's bill, the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2020. In doing so, I begin by saying that the tone that the mover of this bill brings to this debate diminishes the Senate and our ability to have a really robust, meaningful, important discussion about matters of national security and national defence. The way that members of this place are spoken to and spoken about in relation to this should be above party politics. I am going to use my time in this chamber to speak in an appropriate tone for the level of debate required for this important matter. The tone coming from that end of the chamber diminishes the debate itself and diminishes the mover of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin my contribution to this debate, as I'm sure others in the chamber would do, by acknowledging all the Australian Defence Force members who are currently serving overseas and to also acknowledge their families, who have probably spent many nights without their loved ones and hope to see them come home safe and sound. And I acknowledge that nobody in this chamber or in this parliament would seek to send a member of the Australian Defence Force into harm's way without justification, without advice, without the rigour of questions being asked as required. I think we can all acknowledge that respectfully—that we care about these men and women, that they play an incredibly important role in our country and in the defence of our country and that we owe a debt of gratitude to every member of the Defence Force who is deployed overseas currently and who has been deployed overseas in the past. I just want to acknowledge those men and women today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a few issues with this bill and this proposal. I think it's fair to say that the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2020 is a bill that has had many iterations. Since 1985, I think it was, there's been some form of this bill being pushed through debate by members of the Greens or the Democrats. It's something that is discussed from time to time in this place. We've had many parliamentary inquiries, and there is a parliamentary inquiry on foot at the moment about this very issue. So, discussing this is something that I think all parliamentarians take very seriously, as well as looking at it again and again in the context of the geopolitical circumstances that we find ourselves in. We go back and we have a look and consider this with thought, with care. But this is a bill that is not supported by the government, and there are many reasons for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address one of the underlying premises in this bill, and it goes back to the tone of the debate. There seems to be this underlying premise that the decisions that are made by the executive in relation to the deployment of the Defence Force are made in secret, or that there's no accountability to the parliament—that there's some sort of covert decision-making that we don't talk to the public about. But that's not true. We know that decisions sometimes do need to be made quickly, in the interests of the safety of members of the Australian Defence Force and the safety of others overseas. But I'm on many parliamentary committees in relation to defence, and I know that members of Defence diligently come to parliament and sit in front of estimates for hours and hours on end, answering questions. They are called before many inquiries and committees to provide briefings. They provide private briefings to parliamentarians on matters that we need to understand in our roles. And they are accountable to the executive, and the executive is accountable to the Australian people. We know that. I want to dismiss any idea that there is no accountability for the Defence Force or for the executive regarding the decisions that are made and to note that these decisions are ultimately made publicly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge that on the occasions when there is a change in posture and when deployments do occur—and we saw that in the last term of parliament around the evacuation of people from Afghanistan—I think it's fair to say, whether it's the former government or whether it's our government, that the executive really does try to communicate that as urgently as possible to the Australian public and that they do speak to the media about that so that they can be asked questions. But sometimes there are some sensitivities about making that news public before troops are in a safe position. I just want to put that on the record—that I think the former government made that information public at an appropriate time, when the advice was given to them and when it was safe to do that. That's because the nature of deployment, the nature of sending people into harm's way, the nature of sending people into so-called emergency exits, is usually in unforeseen circumstances or where things need to be dealt with quickly. It's very clear that we need to make sure that the Defence Force has the urgency and the flexibility and the opportunity to take these necessary steps. I think that this bill would prevent that from happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also a number of holes in this bill. As the previous speaker alluded to, there's been some sort of attempt to capture this idea of emergency situations, obviously trying to pre-empt a discussion about the Defence Force needing to be agile and effective. But I was reading the bill this morning. It has a few holes. There is no definition of 'emergency exits'. There is a pretty loose term of what an emergency exit would be. I'd be concerned about that. There's no definition of what it means to be required to serve beyond territorial limits and what that could include. And what was concerning to me was that the process of requiring parliament to sit after a proclamation is made through the bill would require information to be made public, possibly in a window that doesn't serve the purposes of the actual emergency exit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are technical terms, but I have done my homework—I've read the bill and I've really considered this in the context of how this would take effect or how it would practically be provided. There are some things that have not been thought through about how this would operate. There's been an attempt to try to say that there's no reason why this bill shouldn't be supported. Well, there are plenty of reasons. There are plenty of holes in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also concerned about one of the subsections in this bill which requires that the minister come back to the parliament every month or at the start of every month of a sitting and provide information that includes the number of people deployed. That's information that we might not necessarily want our enemies to understand at that particular time. I think there is certainly an argument that the Minister for Defence at the time, or the Prime Minister in particular, should be asked genuine questions, but I think across the chamber we are respectful that some information at some times needs to be dealt with sensitively. There is no accounting for that in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are certainly just some of the things I picked up on a first reading. There have been a lot of parliamentary inquiries into previous bills of this nature that have picked up similar issues around unforeseen circumstances. That's because we're dealing with a bill that is about a political agenda of a political party. I know that's something that the Greens might not want to hear, and I'm sure they will be very precious about that, but the truth is that this is something that I know many people in the public have long memories about. They remember previous deployments and how they may or may not have been treated. The Greens political party is seeking to campaign on this issue. Campaigning on the deployment of Defence Force personnel is something that I think is pretty distasteful but this is something that the Greens political party is pushing as a political agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did want to keep the tone of my contribution pretty respectful, but I don't think there is a more self-indulgent, self-righteous, self-interested group in this Senate chamber, who should be so far away from national security decisions it is not funny. These are people who should never, ever be involved in making national security decisions, and they should never, ever be involved in having some sort of balancing power that decides what we do in the defence of our country. That is a pretty broad explanation, but, to make it very clear, this Senate at times has different compositions, and I know that we are subject to the composition of this Senate to pass legislation. Every form of government is. What I would not want to see is a situation where the Greens prevent action being taken because of a political purpose, because of a campaign and in order to seem to hold the executive to account. There are matters where that should happen and does happen, no matter who is sitting on the government benches. There is a purpose to the crossbench, and we respect the crossbench and we respect the composition of the Senate. But what I do not want to see is a situation where we have troops about to be deployed to an emergency situation or to a situation that involves putting people in harm's way and that decision is held up because of the self-interested political purposes of the Greens political party. They should be far removed from national security matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the Australian public would agree with that, and they do. The Greens certainly are not a party of government and they certainly are not a party that takes these issues seriously enough to be part of the decision-making process. They are not members of certain committees in this parliament for very good reason, and that's because only parties of government, I think it's fair to say, take the responsibility of national security seriously in a non-partisan way. We know we have a job to do when we come here. No matter who is in the executive or who the Prime Minister is, we take that role seriously. The members at the end of the chamber in the Greens political party don't take those responsibilities seriously. They should not ever be involved in this decision-making process, and that is something that I'm very, very passionate about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a lot of sympathy, certainly, for some of the community members who have personal experience with this and want to come and talk to us about the impacts that deployment has had, but what I would prefer the Senate to be doing is to be discussing matters relating to how we can improve the lives of veterans who have been deployed. I think everyone around this chamber would agree that that is something that we should be talking about and considering. The Albanese government is working really hard to reduce the DVA backlog. We are delivering 10 Veterans and Families Hubs, and we're also making sure that we have additional payments to veterans in the total and permanent incapacity cohort.  This is the stuff that we should be talking about when it comes to deployment—how we treat the people who return from oversees with respect and with the care that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we shouldn't be doing as a Senate is entertaining the idea that anyone in the Greens political party has any interest in the national security of our country other than their own self-interest and their own political pointscoring. That's what this is about. They can shout and scream and call us names and talk in emotive terms and call people 'warmongers'. The stuff that they do around this is pretty distasteful. They can do all of that, but at the end of the day there's a reason why they're not a party of government—long may that be the case. I do thank other members of this chamber who are engaging in this debate in a respectful way, because our Australian Defence Force members deserve that respect. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  I want to begin by starting where Senator Green concluded: with the respect for our Defence Force personnel. I want to acknowledge all of those women and men who have worn the uniform of our defence forces, those who do wear the uniform of our defence forces and those who will choose to do so in the future. Each of them voluntarily chooses to stand in defence of our nation, our values and our interests and to do so in the service of our country, selflessly. I acknowledge what they do as individuals, but I also acknowledge very much their families and the support that they provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Senator Green's contribution, which was a very thoughtful and considered contribution on the details and principles of the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2020. They are important principles in terms of the consideration of national security and defence and strategic matters for our nation. The importance of the way in which we go about consideration of those defence and security issues requires us to bring a calm and considered approach; to be able to handle matters with the utmost of confidence and sensitivity; and to respond in relation to sensitive and difficult matters with information that is sourced from a variety of locations, some of it highly confidential, but all of it important to reaching firm and clear conclusions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have sat around the National Security Committee of cabinet. It is a solemn responsibility to do so, to find yourself in a situation where you are briefed routinely about activities and threats to our nation; threats to our interests and those of other nations, partners, friends, allies, neighbours; and challenges that we face in the world. Equally, you are briefed about the challenges of natural disasters, peacekeeping operations and a range of different factors, and done so with information sourced from a variety of different countries, platforms, and intelligence means. That solemn responsibility is one where you make critical decisions about the future interests of the nation. I sat there as you made some of those decisions, not in deploying trips to war but certainly in deploying our troops in support of international policing operations and in deploying our AFP officers to undertake those international policing operations. I sat there as a member when we made decisions to deploy our troops in circumstances for the evacuation of Australian personnel, potentially dangerous circumstances and life-threatening circumstances; and through all of those decisions to continue to provide support in places like Iraq, where we have had troops placed for some period of time. Their operations today are very different—still difficult, but different—to the operations from when they were first deployed there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of those decisions weigh heavily upon you, as they should; as should the sensitive security briefings that are provided; as should the difficult decisions to be made about defence investment, positioning and force posture. All such factors require you to weigh the advice before you, assess the advice that you're receiving and give careful consideration to the actions you're taking. You have to do so mindful of the fact that there are human lives at the end of it. There are the human lives of the Australian Defence Force personnel; there are the lives of their families; there are the lives of the people they serve alongside; there are the lives, of course, of those, where it comes to it, that they fight against; and there are the lives of many civilians and other innocent bystanders in any such situation. Weighing all of those issues is something that I would hope anybody tasked with those responsibilities would undertake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, and the approach that Senator Steele-John takes in his argument, has a fundamental failure in its thesis and application, and that is that it ignores the reality that I, previously as a member of the National Security Committee of cabinet, or those ministers in the current government who serve in the NSC are, under our system of government, ultimately accountable. They are members of the executive because under our system of government they are, first and foremost, members of this parliament. They are members of the executive because, under our system of government, they are part of a government that commands majority support in the House of Representatives. Within this bill and this approach advocated there seems to be a perception that the executive sits over here and the parliament sits over there. And, yes, we talk about the separation of powers, but there is an intrinsic link within our Westminster system of government, an intrinsic link that you do not get to be in executive without the support of the parliament. And you do not get to remain a member of the executive without the support of the parliament. The reason I stand on this side of the chamber and not on the other side is because my party no longer commands the support of the parliament for me to be a member of the executive. And so, when it comes to deployment of troops, the premise that every decision of the executive ought be verified by the parliament is one that does not require the type of legislative intervention or the type of approach that Senator Steele-John advocates for. That's because if the majority of the parliament did not support that deployment, then ultimately the consequence of that would potentially be the fall of that government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that then goes to the argument of: 'But what about scrutiny? What about accountability?' Well that, of course, is precisely what the parliament is for. There is no shortage of scrutiny and accountability when it comes to any of the big decisions that government takes. Through its various important committee structures, through its estimates proceedings, through debates such as the one we're having right now, through question time processes and through a range of other opportunities for senators, this chamber upholds the right to scrutinise, the right to argue and the right to contest—and these are all rights we have to be very conscious of defending. Indeed, the defence of those rights is part of the reason why we have a defence force, to be able to undertake those approaches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The conscious decision that the founders of the Commonwealth of Australia took to put section 68 of the Constitution in place, providing that the command of naval and military forces is vested in the Governor-General and therefore in the executive of government, is one that recognises the direct command is an important principle for the effective operation of our defence forces. The ability of executive government to make decisions in critical times is an important thing. The ability of executive government to make those decisions having been fully informed of all of the available information, evidence and analysis—including that which, for sensitive reasons of national security, sensitive reasons that could jeopardise or threaten the life of military personnel, may not all be able to be made public—means there is a logic there. But none of that logic in terms of the executive government having those powers vested in it means in any way, shape or form that we should overlook the reality that the executive is accountable to this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those reasons, the coalition do not support this bill, as we have not supported previous versions of this bill that have been considered and debated over some period of time. We do believe that, consistent with the way our constitution was written and has operated for more than 120 years, the decision to deploy Australian Defence Force personnel should remain at the discretion of the executive. The executive should have that ability to act in a timely manner, and to do so in the best interests of our national security. But, of course, the executive must always remain accountable to this place. Its decisions, whether they be to deploy troops into combat operations or peacekeeping operations or other supportive operations around the world, should nonetheless not be subordinated to the parliament, but of course the executive, in making those decisions should be, must be firmly accountable to the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, having its origins in previous bills, has in various guises been considered by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee before. That committee has upheld in a bipartisan way, as indeed the debate ensuing here in this chamber does today, that the powers ought to remain with the executive. Whilst acknowledging the critical importance of parliamentary debate, the committee has previously stopped short of accepting the requirement for the houses of parliament to approve the deployment of Australian troops. It's acknowledged, in relation to arguments as to why we should maintain the current longstanding constitutional practices, that the disclosure of classified or sensitive intelligence may compromise the operations or the safety of Australian forces or those who they serve alongside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That committee, in its reports and work, has also made the point that if, in order to protect our forces or our allies, classified information had to be withheld from the parliament then those critical decisions about deployment would not be fully informed. That is a point of tension, I appreciate. The parliament itself seeks to resolve that, in part, through the establishment of different committees and procedures for the sharing of classified information. Of course, at critical times in the nation's history and in the history of democratic governments, including Westminster governments, we have even seen the formation of war cabinets or other approaches that really bring the parties of government together to ensure that all are informed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, on intelligence and security matters, we do that through the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, which brings together the parties of government to receive the most sensitive of briefings and to understand and engage with our security agencies on the risks we face. We also do it by other means. I acknowledge that Senator Wong, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is routinely generous in offering and providing relevant sensitive security briefings to me, and the government does so for the shadow minister for defence as well, ensuring that we are versed in understanding of some of the difficult and sensitive issues that the government is dealing with. Whilst not all of the intelligence can be shared publicly, it helps to inform our understanding of the decisions that government is making. It's the parliamentary democracy working at its best, recognising real-world realities around what can and cannot be made public but finding means to accommodate those so that executive government can function, make its decisions and be held accountable but, in that accountability process, can also know that all information is being weighed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Steele-John spoke about other nations. In reality, if we take a look across our Five Eyes partners, for example, overwhelmingly similar practices exist. Some have chosen to bring debates to the floor of their parliaments, but that does not remove the right of their executives to make necessary decisions or prevent the executives exercising that right. That's why we should maintain a practice that for more than 120 years has served our defence personnel and has served governments of the day. Governments may not get every decision absolutely right but each of them is, and absolutely must be, accountable to this place. That's the best way to uphold the integrity of our system.</span>

                    <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I also rise to make a contribution relating to the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2020, which is before the Senate this morning. As many in this place have articulated, both the government and the opposition are certainly not supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who have been in and around or observing the Senate for an extended period of time would hardly be surprised to hear a Labor senator, either in opposition or in government, say such words in response to a bill of this nature. This is because the bill is hardly novel to this chamber. In fact, I think it's important that we have a bit of a look at the history. It's become almost a tradition for some to introduce such a bill in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many respects the bill that we have before us is a carbon copy of a bill that was introduced by former senator Colin Mason, of the Australian Democrats, back in 1985. It is a carbon copy of a bill that was introduced by Senator McLean, also of the Democrats, in 1998. It is the same bill that was brought to the chamber again in 1993, in 1996 and in 2003 by Senators Bartlett and Stott Despoja and in 2008 by Senator Ludlam. So, it's certainly one that has made the rounds here in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the decision to send Australian Defence Force personnel into harm's way is not a decision that's ever taken lightly. As we heard in contributions from my colleague Senator Green and those opposite, we have had a privilege to share part of the ADF's program here in Parliament House through the parliamentary program that's been offered through the Department of Defence. I myself have seen firsthand the dedication of our service men and women of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force and the role they have in advancing our national interests and defending our sovereignty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last year I travelled to the Rim of the Pacific Exercise over in Hawaii. That was consistent with previous interactions with our defence personnel. I was struck by the patriotism shown when I and other members of the parliamentary program were there. It's fair to say that the ADF personnel were very generous to the parliamentarians who participated in the exercise, and I want to thank them again for their time and dedication to Australia and its peoples. This dedication is admirable, and it should never be tested without deep consideration. Although I disagree with the provisions of the bill, when it comes to the rationale behind it I can't fault the moral conviction of those who seek to advance it. Here in parliament is certainly a place to have a debate about going to war. We heard from Senator Birmingham. I think it is fair that the parliament should have the debate. But the decision to send our troops to war should rest with the government of the day. Indeed, I appreciate the significance of the decision. Sending Australians to war is not a decision that is taken lightly, because of the appreciation we have for our ADF personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's also important to note that in the Westminster system of government, as we have here in Australia, it is within the purview of the executive to make decisions regarding the commitment of forces to engagements, be they within our borders or overseas. It is that way because, the way our Constitution is written, the Governor-General, as a representative of His Majesty the King, Commander in Chief of the Australian Defence Force, is constitutionally vested with this responsibility. Such is the effect of section 61 of the Australian Constitution. Acting exclusively on the advice of the Prime Minister and other responsible ministers of the government, the Governor-General gives effect to the decisions of the government of the day, which is responsible to the parliament here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives and through our parliamentary processes, which obviously extend to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government supports the continuation of current arrangements that govern the deployment of the Australian Defence Force to overseas engagements. We do so because it is essential that decisions of this type are able to be taken swiftly in response to international events. Indeed, we have seen in recent years, with open conflict once more on the European continent, how important it is that there exists a legal framework to support the sudden defence of the national interest in the manner that only the Australian Defence Force can. But whilst this may be so, it would be a mistake to suggest that there is not a role for the parliament at all. On this side of the chamber we also support the notion that such decisions of the executive should be made with the appropriate level of parliamentary and public scrutiny, and it is only with such transparency that the Australian community can have faith that these decisions are made on their behalf and in keeping with their expectations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of this commitment that the Australian Labor Party took to the election a policy to establish an inquiry into our armed-conflict decision-making. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a policy that has since been acted upon, with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, Richard Marles, making reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on 28 September last year. I'm a member of this committee, and I note that it has so far received 113 submissions. I also note that the committee is yet to finalise its report to the parliament. It is disappointing that this bill has been brought on for debate before that report has been considered by or tabled in the parliament. I say 'disappointing' because, despite the many iterations of this bill and the frequency with which it appears before the chamber, it retains many, I think, deficiencies that have previously been identified through inquiries and debates. Because of the seriousness of the matters this bill would seek to amend, it is of the utmost importance that this legislation is considered deeply and comprehensively. When dealing with matters that will put Australian lives on the line, nothing should be left to chance. Successive committee inquiries have highlighted that the provisions of this and very similar earlier bills leave too much to chance and fail to address the concerns of unintended consequences arising should its passage through the parliament be allowed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its 2021 report on this bill, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade stated that it was left with concerns about how certain provisions of this bill would operate in practice and about unintended or unforeseen consequences. The report stated that concerns exist about the disclosure of classified or sensitive information that was necessary to inform decision-making would be made available for parliamentary debate without compromising Australia or its allies. It also stated that the bill would reduce flexibility needed in Australia's complex and uncertain strategic environment, and I think it's important to note that our environment has only become more complex and uncertain since this report was produced. Lastly and appropriately, the committee noted that the geographical limitations that the bill would place on parliamentary approval of overseas service did not account for the increasingly important conflict that occurs in space and cyberspace. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ALP has always had concerns with previous iterations of this bill placing constraints on the government's capacity and its ability to respond to situations requiring urgency. The urgency required in these situations—situations that we of course hope never, never eventuate—is necessary for the function of committing Australian forces to engagements to sit within the executive. The reasons why the government opposes the bill are consistent with the reasons that Labor has opposed similar bills, dating right back to 1985, and that is another reason why it is disappointing that the bill has come before the chamber today, instead of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade having finalised its report. I would urge senators, once that report is tabled, to obviously have another discussion here in this place and make a contribution and get involved in the processes with that joint standing committee's inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts and arguments upon which the government has formed its view of this legislation have not changed—and I'm sure the same is true of other parties around the chamber—except noting that our strategic environment is even more fraught and uncertain than when we previously considered a similar bill. The bill does not address the concerns that have been raised with previous iterations; instead, it appears that proponents of the bill have just hoped that maybe the Senate has changed its mind, or the numbers have shifted. I really want to applaud the moral convictions of those who have put this bill—and Senator Steele-John is rightly very passionate about these issues of concern, and, quite frankly, this is the appropriate place to have these debates. But I really would urge Senator Steele-John to reconsider the consequences of maybe delaying decisions and the role the executive has while ensuring that there is still accountability in this place. The parliament has to have accountability for the executive, regardless of which side of politics is in power. I know there are many convictions that we probably share, but I really do feel that what is important here is ensuring that the government of the day has the right amount of information, has the right time and has the ability to support our men and women in uniform when the time comes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, before I conclude, I make the point too that it is important that we are mindful that the functions of the executive remain as they have been. No decision made by government is as consequential or important as the decision to deploy the Australian Defence Force into combat, but we must also consider that, in what may be a rapidly changing security situation, the decision to not deploy the ADF also has consequences, as does any delay in decisions being made. Any proposal to alter that decision-making process and who is responsible for it must be subject to scrutiny. This chamber has gone through that scrutiny process on bills many times before. Any changes to our national security arrangements must be deeply considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our concerns about unforeseen legal and operational consequences of the bill have not been addressed, the government is not in a position to support this bill. But I do look forward to the report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade being finalised after proper consideration of the 113 submissions before it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  Well, all I can say is here we go again. Labor and the Greens have again sacrificed Australian prosperity on the altar of climate change. Labor and the Greens have again colluded to make everything that matters more expensive for Australians already struggling with the rising cost of living. Labor and the Greens have again schemed to create more crippling energy shortages in Australia. Labor and the Greens have again acted together to put the brakes on Australia's economic growth and then put it in reverse. Labor has shown it cannot stand against the climate extremism of the Greens. Anthony Albanese, our PM, and Chris Bowen have capitulated to Adam Bandt's hypocrisy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if you accept the stupid idea that cutting Australia's human carbon dioxide emissions is necessary, and I certainly don't accept it, restricting gas supply is just about the worst thing you can do. Increasing gas supply is absolutely crucial to shoring up unreliable renewable energy. Even the Europeans understand this. The European Union have reclassified natural gas as a clean, green source of energy because they've learned, at great cost to their economies, they can't rely solely on intermittent wind and solar power. That's why they're firing up gas power plants and even restoring coal power plants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Greens and Labor won't tell you is that forcing Australian companies to cut carbon dioxide emissions as part of a global effort is utterly futile. Even if Australia's CO2 were cut to zero overnight, CO2 increases in China alone would negate this cut within a year. This is where Greens hypocrisy is at its very worst. They work to cripple Australia with CO2 cuts but don't condemn China for contributing 30 per cent of the world's human CO2 emissions. They're happy to accept China's solar panels and steel for wind turbines, made with Australian iron and Australian coal, but won't condemn China for its plans to add two billion tonnes to its annual emissions of 12 billion tonnes. The Greens will condemn Australia for buying a few nuclear powered submarines but not China for expanding its arsenal of nuclear weapons. They will criticise Australia over human rights but not China's Communist regime for its much worse human rights violations. Hypocrisy!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' insistence that CO2 is a pollution is a lie. They are lying to us. There would be virtually no life on Earth without carbon dioxide—no plant life, no animal life, no Greens senator and no useless idiots to vote for them. CO2 is a natural part of life, and it's undeniably a scientific fact that human caused CO2 is only about three per cent, if that, of all the CO2 in our atmosphere and oceans. We cannot, and will never be able to, control or change the 97 per cent of CO2 from natural sources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even one of the Greens' favourite prophets of doom, Tim Flannery—remember that man who said, 'Our dams never be full again,' 'It'll never rain,' and 'We'll be in drought', this same man who they hold up there on his platform—said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the world as a whole cut all emissions tomorrow the average temperature of the planet is not going to drop in several hundred years, perhaps as much as a thousand years …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why all the panic? Why all the scaremongering? Why go on as if you're destroying the planet? That's what it is—scaremongering. You've got nothing to back it up with, not even that holier-than-thou Tim Flannery, who you quote and you hold up there. Those were his words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">cut all emissions tomorrow the average temperature of the planet is not going to drop in several hundred years, perhaps as much as a thousand years …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you're prepared to destroy our industries, our jobs, our manufacturing and the cost of living. You're prepared to do that. This is Labor. This is the Greens. This is what people voted for. Well, not until the people of this country start hurting, really hurting, will you understand the impact of all these stupid, bloody policies going through this parliament and maybe change your minds and wake people up in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forcing companies to cut CO2, or otherwise offset them, will only increase their costs, forcing them to cut Australian jobs and eventually take their business somewhere else—but not before they're forced to pass on these enormous costs to Australian consumers. Australian consumers, you are going to pay for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is nothing more than a carbon tax in disguise, along with a direct attack on the gas industry, crippling supplies when energy shortages demand we increase then. This makes absolutely no sense. In fact, this attack on the gas industry places the Labor governments' own CO2 reduction targets in jeopardy, because there are no renewables without reliable natural gas supplies. There is no economic hydrogen production without natural gas. There is no fertiliser for our farmers without natural gas. The Greens want to end natural gas production. They want to get rid of it. Their economic and scientific illiteracy is almost as stunning as their hypocrisy, and Labor has rolled over and given in to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be interesting to find out just what else is in this deal Labor has done with their Greens devil. It will be interesting to see what else this legislation will do as it plays out in the economy. It doesn't define what a safeguard mechanism credit actually is or what it's supposedly worth. It invests incredible power in the hands of the minister to personally decide if Australian companies have done enough to meet CO2-reduction demands and to punish those who haven't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much wrong with this legislation, not least that, once again, Labor is ramming it through the Senate with the help of the Greens' rookie senator David Pocock. One Nation puts Australia and Australians first, so we cannot possibly support a bill that worsens our cost-of-living crisis, costs Australian jobs and cripples what is left of Australian industry and manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also add, we need to address the gas that we have off the North West Shelf that is in Commonwealth waters. Deals have been done to allow Western Australia to take 15 per cent of that domestic gas supply which belongs to the Australian people. This is in Commonwealth waters. Now Santos is going to put another gas field off the shores of Darwin, in Commonwealth waters, that we are going to get nothing for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party talks about how we're going to fund the $368 billion for the nuclear subs. I'll go on about it again. We have a resource that we can make so much money from for the country, yet no-one is prepared to do it. The Prime Minister said we should get rid of the petroleum resource rent tax. No-one has done anything about it. The coalition did nothing about it. You're giving them an uplift factor of 15 per cent. They're making billions out of it. The fact is that they have over $400 billion in tax credits that belong to the Australian people, but you keep giving them a 15 per cent uplift factor on their investment every year. That has accumulated to the credit of $400 billion. We see about $77 billion or $80 billion worth of gas going out of the country, and we get nothing for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What fools the people in this place are to not have done anything about it. You're reluctant to do it—why? Have deals been done with these multinational companies? People in Australian companies and businesses are struggling to get the gas supply that they want to run their houses. Now you come up with the policy that you're going to get rid of the gas in Australian homes and replace it with electricity. How the hell are you going to do that, when you can't even get enough electricity now? The plants are shutting down because of reliable supply, which we don't get through solar and wind. Yet you're prepared to get rid of gas and tell everyone they have to go to electricity. At whose cost? Who's going to pay for this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have one of the most resource-rich countries in the world, and you are not going to deal with this. Why? I don't understand why you're not addressing this. This gas belongs to the Australian people, and we should be getting the money from it. Make them pay for it. Get rid of the PRRT. You could do it tomorrow, but you keep giving them more and more leases. Let's see what you do about Santos. Let's see if you're going to make them pay for the gas. Tell the Australian people. Do you know what? You're not going to. That's my understanding of it. How pathetic you really are. You don't care about the Australian people, people living in the homes. There's not enough housing. Bring in another million-plus people—about 650,000 next year. Disgusting.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  It might be worth making some opening remarks. My last contribution, I think, was at around four o'clock this morning, and I elected at that time to keep my remarks brief so as not to detain the Senate. The business before the Senate today is important. Today we are a step closer to reaching net zero by 2050. It's my hope that by the time this debate is concluded we will have established important and enduring arrangements to assist Australia in this transformation. We seek to establish not just the steps that will take us towards meeting the target but also the steps that will ensure that our economy is geared up to take advantage of the economic opportunities that will come with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2023, which is before the parliament this morning, will deliver 205 million tonnes of emissions reductions by 2030. That's equivalent to taking two-thirds of Australia's cars off the road. I make this point: these reforms are long overdue. They are sensible reforms, and they are designed to ensure that Australia's largest emitters remain competitive in a global economy that is decarbonising. They follow eight months and three rounds of extensive consultation with industry that covered facilities, consultation with the broader public and consultation in the parliament. This morning, I thank those parliamentarians who have constructively engaged with that process. Regrettably, that is not all of the parliamentarians in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms before us deliver the investment certainty that is required for the included businesses. The final changes, the amendments before the parliament today, will strengthen the scheme for strategic industries and for climate. They include providing improved flexibility and support for strategic industries and strengthening accountability, transparency and integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that a range of senators have general questions to put, so I don't intend to immediately move the government amendments that have been circulated. But I do indicate to the chamber that I will seek to do so relatively quickly so that the Senate may engage with the substance of what's before them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People understand the history—that the safeguard mechanism was put in place by the previous government, and it was supposedly to keep a lid on the emissions of Australia's biggest emitters. But unfortunately, under the previous government, emissions were increasing. The reforms before us received wide support. That includes support from the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Australian Industry Group. The reason they support them is that these reforms finally deliver the policy certainty that's necessary to allow businesses to make investments—investments in their future competitiveness, investments that will allow them to meet their corporate net zero commitments that most of the carbon facilities already have; 80 per cent of the safeguard facilities and 85 per cent of the safeguard emissions are covered by corporate commitments to net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We thank the people who have been involved in the consultation process. We thank the people who drafted submissions—hundreds of submissions. We thank the people who attended the round tables around the country and engaged closely with industry and climate groups. And we thank the people in the parliament who engaged in this in good faith. It is past time that we did this. We have had 10 years without a settled climate policy and as a consequence we have had 10 years without a settled energy policy, and that has real consequences for Australians. The reforms before us protect our climate and they protect our economy. These reforms should have bipartisan support. I look forward to the debate across the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  Before I get into my questions and general remarks I want to place on the record my thanks to the staff and attendants of the Senate who so patiently supported the operations of this chamber last night. It was a long debate, concluding at about 4.30, as Senator McAllister, the minister, said. So I very much want to put on record my thanks, including to Hansard and all the other support that we receive in this place. It's an unusual workplace, and it can give rise to unusual settings like that. But it's important to recognise, indeed, the support that we are provided at strange hours of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my consideration of this legislation that's before us I, and on behalf of the coalition, want to commence by re-examining the pathways to where we are today and in doing so acknowledge that it was only a few minutes ago that we received the amendments that we are going to be considering, the amendments that are the fruit of the deal that's been done between Labor and the Greens. I think it's important to acknowledge that for proper debate and scrutiny to occur on these things we need time to deliberate. Now, I am pleased that, as I understand it, the government are going to allow debate on this bill to go on until it's exhausted—that is, until the guillotine falls on the debate of this bill at one o'clock tomorrow, including of course all the intervening items of business that this Senate will consider. But there is a lot to unpack here as a result of this murky deal that's been done. I want to revisit one element of it that concerns me most, and that is what now appears to have been feigned concern from the Australian Greens around the modelling that the Australian government would not provide in relation to this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A public interest immunity claim was lodged by the government in relation to the modelling that the Senate Environment and Communications Committee sought, and they said, 'No, you can't have it.' This modelling, relating to Australian carbon credit units, was cabinet-in-confidence, in the first instance, and then of course the excuse under public interest immunity claims changed to 'market sensitivities' down the track. Whatever the reason might be, they were determined not to provide it to us. Why? We don't know. My hunch is that it shows that a lot of what we're talking about here is not actually underpinned by solid modelling and it's all bunkum. But we'll never know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most concerning part was not the fact that the Australian government refused to provide transparency, refused to provide the information that I would have thought senators in this place would benefit from seeing to make an informed decision. The people in here are intelligent people, committed to their communities, committed to the people who work and live in their states. They would benefit from this information. Instead, the government have hidden it. They will keep it secret. That's fine. That's what they've done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most concerning part was this false concern the Australian Greens had in indicating to us that they wanted this modelling too. They put down their own motion, at the same time we put ours down. We said, 'No, you can't deal with this bill until we see the modelling.' I think that's fair. If there's nothing to hide, why hide it? Indeed, they wouldn't reveal it. The Greens put down a similar motion, suggesting, 'Well, we'd love to see it too but we won't stop debate on the bill until we change our minds.' The thing is—</span>

                    </a>  Another worthy interjection from Senator Pratt. I'm grateful for that brilliant intervention. The point is, the Greens weren't ever interested in seeing this modelling. They were interested in buying enough time to do a deal. While this motion was on the books, while we were having our Senate committee, there was a smoke filled room, somewhere in this building, with Greens and Labor senators, their minister and the Greens spokesperson on energy. They were setting down to work out exactly what it was they would be agreeing on, what parts of the economy they would be sacrificing, what jobs they would determine not worthy, which ones they shouldn't be looking after, and what parts of Australia could be sold out in the name of political expediency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens sold out. We know that there are members, elements, of the Greens that aren't happy. I read out in the second reading debate a tweet, from my colleague Senator McKim, which was quite inflammatory, I thought. I won't read it out here again. For those interested, go and have a look at <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> or perhaps have a trawl through Senator McKim's Twitter feed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also remarked on former senator Bob Brown's resignation as a foundation life member of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Clearly, the committed environmentalists in this country are looking at what the Australian Greens are doing now and, as I've already said, they're selling out. They're compromising on their values. I made the point that former Senator Brown and I agree on not many things, other than Tasmania's a great place, but one thing I can say of him is he is a man of conviction, and one must respect that. That continues to this day, from well beyond the bounds of this chamber. He continues to let the world know what it is he believes, advocating for it, standing for it and making sure that people understand what real Greens are. He, I believe, is one of those. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, what we see today is not a replication of that. We see a Greens party that has decided, 'Let's do a deal. Let's deal ourselves into the game and get what we can, no matter what the cost.' So murky deals, backroom discussions, a Labor-Greens power-sharing agreement— whatever name you want to give it—that's what we're dealing with here now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw an element of that this morning. The Australian government, the Labor Party, decided, 'We're going to punish the coalition for not signing up to our policy, even though at the election we told them we wouldn't and we told the people of Australia we wouldn't,' by denying us the capacity to debate our private senator's bill on Thursday. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, though I think that may be a little too generous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That private senator's bill, I might add, was about developing a mechanism so the people of Australia, across the country, can see what power prices are doing and from what source energy is being generated—renewable, fossil fuels, you name it—every quarter. I'm looking forward to debating that, when we get the chance—if the Australian government sees sense and allows us to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come to these amendments that were cooked up in secret as a result of this dirty, dodgy deal. I want to know, from the government, when drafting instructions were first issued for these amendments. When were relevant officials tasked with these amendments? I think that's important to understand. We were given these amendments today—at the commencement of debate, in effect. That's not a long time to thumb through the 16- or 17-page additional explanatory memorandum, to understand the far-reaching impacts these changes will have let alone the bill that we've been looking at. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What consultation, what scrutiny, has occurred? I'd love to know who out there in the business community, in the ENGO part of the universe, has had a look at these. I'd love to know. The Senate is being asked to vote on this bill, so I would love to know what level of consultation has occurred and what input occurred into the backroom deal that has been done here. Fundamentally: a date, a time, and by whom and to whom these drafting instructions were issued. As a supplementary question, perhaps, I might also ask, in addition to first drafting instructions, when final drafting instructions were issued and when the amendments we now have before us at the eleventh hour, as part of this sneaky deal—you can clothe it as whatever you like, but that's what it is. You just chucked it on the table today in the hope no-one will notice and it will just rush through this week and we can all forget about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I tell you what: the big reminder is going to come in just a few months time, in the depths of winter, when Australian households and businesses are opening their power bills and they're not going to be any less than what they were as a result of this or any other legislation that's been introduced by this government. We've got to remember, colleagues, it was this government that said before the election 97 times that they would reduce power bills by $275. It's also important to remember it's this government that can't actually say that number now at all, even in answer to a question that was asked last week by my good friend Senator O'Sullivan, who's not here now. He asked the minister, 'Can you say the number 275?' He refused to say it. That's how allergic to keeping promises this crowd are. As a result, power prices are going to go up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have bills like this driving up power prices. Bizarrely, in the same week that we have the bill that we passed yesterday for the National Reconstruction Fund, which is supposed to revitalise our manufacturing sector and create jobs, we're going to strangle the same sector by driving up the cost of doing business. One thing I'll disagree with Senator Hanson on: she said it is a carbon tax in disguise. It's not in disguise; it's in full view. It is a carbon tax. So when were drafting instructions issued first, and when were they were finally issued?</span>

I can step Senator Duniam through the timetable if he needs assistance. In 2021, on 3 December, we announced very publicly we would reform the safeguard mechanism as part of the Powering Australia Plan. On 1 July, when we'd formed a government, we appointed an independent panel to review the integrity of ACCUs. On 8 August 2022, we initiated consultation on the safeguard mechanism reform, and there's a paper that's still available on the website if you would like to review it. On 10 October 2022, we opened consultation on the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2023. On 30 November 2022, we introduced that bill into the parliament. On 9 January, we released the independent review of ACCUs that was undertaken by Professor Chubb. On 10 January, we released a further paper which outlined the proposed reforms which form the substance of the bill before you. On 27 March, following discussions with a range of stakeholders, we released updated reforms.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those consultations were extensive, as I have indicated in the contribution I made before. They covered businesses, other community stakeholders and parliamentarians, as you would expect them to do. I find it surprising that the opposition objects to a government that is willing to work across the parliament to seek support for reforms. The very great shame, I think, for the opposition is that they dealt themselves out of this process from the very beginning. They said no before they even saw the legislation, which has become the hallmark of the opposition under Mr Dutton. So we're not really going to take lectures about processes of engagement, because this is an opposition that has essentially refused to engage with a very significant economic reform. They have chosen not to engage. They said no. We've taken the responsible route to engage all those stakeholders across the chamber who have an interest and all those stakeholders outside of the parliament. The arrangements that were made very publicly by Minister Bowen on 27 March reflect that very broad consultation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise to contribute to this debate on the safeguards mechanism. Coal and gas have taken a huge hit. It's no mistake. You only have to read the papers over the last few days. We have stopped nearly half of the 116 new fossil fuel projects that are currently in the pipeline. By doing what we have, we have ensured that in fact pollution will go down as part of these amendments. We have derailed the Beetaloo and the Barossa projects, and we've negotiated amendments, not dirty deals as the opposition have alluded to—I think that's pretty rich coming from their side—so that we've prevented more public money from being sucked into coal and gas projects in this country, unlike their gas-led recovery that they did during COVID. So I want to be really clear that this is actually a very huge win for the planet, but there's still lots of work to do. Currently there are lots of industry based grant funds that are being given to fossil fuel projects through the climate crisis. This is absolutely unacceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our amendments will ensure that grants under the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 are not given to any more coal and gas projects in this country. There is now one less pocket of public money that's going to these greedy corporations to dip into. That should be a good win for the public interest. That's what this place represents. We know that 47 per cent of the current emissions covered by this scheme come from fossil fuel companies. That is no mistake. It's not something we over here at the Greens have made up; it's actually the science. It's important to note that this is the current emissions. This does not actually account for new entrants—the ones that are also in the pipeline, ready to be approved. From the outset, it's already posed that there's a significant problem that the government has identified. The Greens agree that this is a problem in relation to our emissions. In the middle of a climate crisis, the Labor government will still look at these projects, and we over here at the Greens will still fight ferociously for rest of those projects in the pipeline to be shut down. The safeguard mechanism, before the Greens secured these wins, would have allowed that to happen. We have put the handbrake on this, and we're not ashamed to say that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our amendments include a hard cap on emissions, meaning real pollution will come down and the coal and gas corporations can't buy their way out of the cap with the dodgy offsets. To compliment this change, there will also be a pollution trigger, which will now require new coal and gas projects to be assessed against the hard cap, and they can be stopped based on their impact on the climate. How hard is that? It's not rocket science. If you don't meet the hard cap, you cannot continue. You should not proceed to your final investment decision in these projects. This will be the first time since the safeguard mechanism was established under Tony Abbott that we can have confidence that pollution will actually come down in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Abating emissions on site should be a priority for industries across this country that are captured under this mechanism. We understand that reductions can't happen overnight. That is a reality, so some offsets will be needed. However, they should in fact be the last resort. In cases where either emissions cannot be abated on site or there still needs to be a small buffer while there is technology being developed and implemented, this is the only time we should see offsets used. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been significant concerns raised about the integrity of these dodgy offsets, particularly with the human induced regeneration by the ACCU issue. The Greens have also heard these concerns. We have secured a pause on these credits until they are actually going through an independent audit. We think that's important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This could take up to a quarter of future offsets off the table, which will force companies to cut pollution onsite. That is what it's meant to do. We are in a climate crisis. This is urgent. We're not in a casual walk towards climate action. We should be in a sprint, and that is what was said last week in the IPCC report. Climate action is needed, and it's needed now. Further, companies will have to report on and justify the use of their offsets to ensure this, which will help prevent greenwashing—the greenwashing that we have seen presented to us in this chamber. In the 18 months that I've represented the resources portfolio on behalf of the Australian Greens, I have seen more greenwashing than I have in my lifetime. We have to ensure that we are addressing that. Fracking in the Beetaloo and the development of the Barossa gas field have been derailed. They are now having to justify to their investors why this is still a viable option. Tamboran, who are the proponents for the Beetaloo project, will be forced to offset all of their emissions from day one, adding an estimated $1 billion a year. And Santos, who are the proponents for the Barossa gas field, will be forced to offset all of its CO2 emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a big day for the Greens movement as we continue to work alongside the government, but it's an even bigger day for traditional owners, First Nations people who never gave their free, prior and informed consent. We have challenged that. They have challenged that in the Beetaloo and in the Barossa gas fields. I've stood in solidarity with some of those traditional owners and campaigners, and what great grassroots campaigns they have run. They have run these against the gas giants in this country, and they've taken the challenge right up to them. I want to congratulate the eight Tiwi clan groups led, by the Munupi clan in the Tiwi Islands. This is a moment they can share in. Last night I had a wonderful conversation because they are now seeing a glimmer of light, another opportunity of hope for them to make sure that land and sea country across this country is not being destroyed by the state capture of the two major parties in this place who continue to fund fossil fuel projects in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Beetaloo and the Barossa gas field are not the only threats to our climate. Traditional owners from Narrabri, Otway and, in my home state, the Scarborough project up on the Burrup Peninsula and the Kimberley are continuing the fight. The Barossa and the Beetaloo are some of the biggest projects that are the closest to production. They have the biggest targets, which is why we focused our negotiations on them. Both of these are climate bombs, and they are equally linked to—funnily enough—the dirty Middle Arm hub that's proposed in Larrakia country in Darwin. The impacts of these projects will flow on to Middle Arm, and we all remember the debate we had about Middle Arm, where the government and the opposition sat together against us trying to ask for information about why Middle Arm was even approved. We remember question time when I asked Minister Watt about the use of petrochemicals in the wording, and the greenwashing that was put up by the Northern Territory and the federal governments. But rest assured the Greens are still here fighting. We're fighting against Scarborough, we're fighting against Narrabri, we're fighting against the Browse Basin, we're fighting against fracking in the Kimberley and we're against so many other projects. We will continue to fight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, we may have already wiped out some of these with the hard cap, and that is a great move and a great start. I'm so proud of the work that's gone into these negotiations. The opposition can try and paint that up any way you want, but we are proud that we have been able to negotiate these with the government. We know that the people are with us. We are in solidarity with First Nations people across this country. We are in solidarity with climate scientists, our Pacific Island neighbours and the majority of people who should and do believe that we are in a climate crisis. We should be shutting down coal and gas projects across this country and, particularly, not opening up any new ones. This shows that we can work with the government on much needed improvements, and Labor's safeguard is better now because of the work that we have been able to collaborate on. I'm sorry that the opposition is sitting there blank faced, not wanting to hear that. We will keep pushing. We will keep campaigning on the ground with people. We will create a movement that is serious about climate action, and we will continue to deliver.</span>

Importantly, they add a requirement to make changes to subordinate legislation if the budget is not on track or to take other steps to address that problem. To inform this advice, the environment minister would be required to provide information about emissions from proposed actions that are likely to result in a new facility being covered by the safeguard mechanism or a safeguard facility increasing its emissions after approving the action under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This advice would be provided to the Climate Change Authority and to the minister responsible for the Climate Change Act. In the coming weeks, the minister will be releasing associated rules which are required to enable these changes. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles"> of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I appreciate the acknowledgement from the minister that there's a lot more in general that we need to cover with regard to this, despite having moved into the government amendments. It is in relation to those amendments that came to the table not that long ago and that we are still working our way through. Yes, there's been a lot of public commentary. There were a couple of second reading speeches given last night that gave voice to what effect it was that the agreement that's been reached would have. There are a few areas of conflict over the extent to which these amendments would reach, but we'll come to that a little later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go back to the question that I didn't really get an answer to. I asked the minister for a specific date and time about when drafting instructions were issued for the amendments that we now have, that we were provided with not long ago—within the last hour or so—and, of course, the supplementary explanatory memorandum. I'll ask that question again. I'd also be interested to know, in addition to that, when the drafted amendments were first seen by the government and those that they are doing this deal with—the Australian Greens and anyone else on the crossbench. I took great interest in the time line of the path to where we are today and the announcement that was made on 27 March. As you said, Minister, post discussions with a range of stakeholders including, as I understand it, members of the crossbench. What I was interested in is that a series of amendments have been moved that have material effect. They alter what was announced as part of your election package. They change what was taken to the election and they also change what was consulted on around August—8 August was the date you provided—and the consultation on the safeguard mechanism credit scheme on 10 October. They change what was introduced in November. I'm interested, post all of that—and you referenced discussions that culminated in the announcement on 27 March—in what public consultation there was around the detail of what we're talking about here. That's why I'm asking these questions about when instructions were issued for drafting. When were they seen? Who by? This is important in order to understand how much sunlight has been shone on the deal that's been done with the Greens. While we try and get our head around this, I will continue to ask these questions between now and when the Labor Party, in partnership with the Greens, will guillotine debate tomorrow on one of the most serious laws and the impact it will have on the economy. That will all be guillotined. We won't get a chance beyond one o'clock tomorrow to discuss this further, and it will be left to the people of Australia to make a decision about whether this was good or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do have to take issue with some of the points that Senator Cox made. I appreciate anyone who comes into this place with strong conviction, but I'll tell you who we stand in the corner of, and that is in the corner of the consumer and the household that's paying more for electricity, for fuel, for food and on their mortgage. The consumer, the household and the business were all promised before the last election that these things would go down, but they're not. We will come to exactly how this legislation is going to put downward pressure, as Senator Farrell has said innumerable times this week, on the cost of living. I'd be interested in how this fits into this narrative the government has got running. How does the safeguard mechanism—and you don't have to answer this now, because we'll have a lot of time to answer this—drive down the cost of living for Australian households? </span>

It's called offshoring.</span>

                    </a>  It counts when it comes to emissions as well, as Senator Cadell says. By tidying up our own backyard and forcing some of these businesses offshore—because I don't believe there are assurances to keep these businesses here and minimise their impact on the environment and work with those businesses to do so—not only are we offshoring the emissions but we're also offshoring their jobs and the economic value to the community. </span>

                    </span>So, again, huge changes were proposed in these last-minute amendments, part of a dodgy deal between this one group of people. They go by different names—Labor, Green—but they're one team. They always are and always will be. That's the kind of thing they do. They team up to shut down the economy and pick on regional Australia. But yes, more detail around those time lines would be very helpful, because we all know this is leading to one thing, and that is economic Armageddon.</span>

I won't go through the time line again, but the government has taken the approach of consulting very, very widely with a very wide range of stakeholders over an extended period of time in arriving at this point.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Duniam, you are quite right that the position paper released on 8 August 2022 asked a series of questions and sought feedback on them. The position paper released on 10 January this year similarly sought feedback on a range of more detailed propositions. Consultation on the detail that is before the parliament and the detail that is proposed to be placed into the associated subordinate legislation has been very wideranging indeed. Not only is that not unusual from a government committed to a proper policy process; it's actually necessary. A very large range of people have been engaged in discussions. I am not personally privy to every one of them, but I am conscious that both the department and the minister have been engaged with a range of stakeholders in bringing this together. As to the specific questions around drafting, I'll see what information I can provide to you, but drafting is the end product of a policy process, and the policy process has been very public indeed.</span>

I'm absolutely disgusted that, less than an hour ago, I was given your amendments to this bill. You have disregarded my position in this place, and it's either incompetence or sheer arrogance that you bring this amendment into the chamber at such a late stage and you intend to guillotine the debate. You have no regard for my position or my colleagues' positions. You have no regard for anyone in this place other than yourself, the Greens and David Pocock. I don't know what deals you've done with Jacqui Lambie or others, if they're supporting this bill, but you have no regard for others.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time this has happened; it happened with the IR bill as well. I got the final documents to my office on the Wednesday night at 9.30, and it was guillotined and pushed through on the Thursday in this place. I spoke to the Prime Minister about this, saying that I was not happy with not getting information. I'm not getting briefed by the ministers. I have not had one—I'm sorry; I have. Murray Watt came to my office one time to discuss the dairy bill with me, but that's the only one. Labor does not contact my office to give me briefings or to explain their bills to me—nothing. Apart from that, they cut back my staff so that I can't get across all the legislation that's rammed through this place. It's okay for David Pocock. He had the IR bill on the Sunday. He made up his mind he was going to support it on the Sunday. We had no idea till the following Wednesday. This is absolutely atrocious and disgusting of this government.</span>

I've worked here under the Turnbull government and the Morrison government, and this is the worst government I have ever come across to work with in this place, ramming its legislation through. The disdain that those opposite have for other members in this chamber is unbelievable. It's sheer arrogance. I'm here because the people of Queensland voted for me. I have every right to be here and I have every right to be paid the respect to get this legislation in enough time to revise it. The minister talks about consultation with businesses, but I don't agree—I don't believe there has been enough consultation. Labor has just come up with policies. I've spoken to businesses that are not happy with this.</span>

Perhaps what I can say is that, when the Australian government considers its emissions projections, one of the things it contemplates is the level of economic activity, and, of course, population size is a feature of projections for economic activity. I might indicate also that I have some advice in relation to your question about the emissions in the period you referenced. It is an approximation, but between 1 July 2020 and 1 July 2023 it is around 420 million tonnes.</span>

You are increasing immigration to the country, and by 2030, it is estimated, around two million or more—that is just people coming to live here to Australia, migrants, let alone the students, tourists and everyone else. For those two million or more people, I tell you: do you have—no, I will ask you. We'll see if you've done your sums. How much emissions will these two million new migrants up to 2030 release in Australia of their CO2?</span>

I have also indicated that in preparing our projections for emissions the level of economic activity is contemplated, and that includes population projections. So I think I have probably answered your question, although perhaps not in terms that you would like.</span>

If you are going to penalise these companies from trying to actually—industries and manufacturing, and you have just passed a bill to get industries and manufacturing going in Australia, and that is what you purport. But under this bill you are basically going to penalise them. What I'm saying here is that you are increasing your immigration by nearly two million people into Australia. Forget about the impact that is going to have on housing, hospitals, infrastructure, water and everything else. We are talking about CO2, which this whole bill is purely about. I will tell you something that you don't know. By the immigrants coming into nearly two million people in the country by 2030, you're going to have 45½ million tonnes of CO2 extra into it. Tell me, Minister: is the government going to buy carbon credits for their emissions?</span>

You referenced some in an earlier answer about what's been agreed to. What are we dealing with here that has been agreed to, and what will be dealt with by way of delegated legislation?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same vein as the complaint Senator Hanson made about the complete disdain for anyone who wasn't part of the negotiation, any party or grouping of senators who did not sign up to a safeguard at the last election has been characterised as saying no. I tell you what, we do say no to higher taxes. We do say no to offshoring emissions. We do say no to driving up the cost of electricity. We do say no to penalising hardworking Australians with bad policy that will not deliver the outcomes the government says it will.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd be interested to understand how much hidden legislation there will be. Sure, we'll get to have a look at it because it is disallowable by its nature, but if it's part of the agreement, and we're here voting on this legislation today—again, I'd point out the fact that amendments are a very important part of any proper democratic debate on legislation. Notwithstanding the long period of time between when the policy was announced prior to the election, the election and the tabling of the first round of draft laws, a lot has changed. So to point to that front end of the process being very important and minimising this end, which is actually where we make laws—where we are voting on behalf of the people we represent about what is good, what is bad—will it have the effect the government says it will? This is what we're interrogating now. It's also important to understand what of this will be tucked away and hidden in delegated legislation, and what effect those changes might be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, I'm very interested in this difference of opinion between the government and the Greens over the nature and effect of the agreement that has been reached here. I will interrogate that a bit later on. I just flag that now. I think this is important for the people of Australia, who have obviously heard all the talking points through the various interviews that have been conducted, doorstops by Mr Bandt and others around the success they have had in strangling the fossil fuel sector, but there is a very different take on things from you, Minister, so I would be interested to interrogate that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the basic question I have here is, what of the changes to what was put on the table originally is going to be found in delegated legislation? Has anything been drafted yet in terms of the delegated legislation? If it has commenced but is not yet completed, what stage are we at? Who is being consulted on that? Is it the same group of people that had the broad conversations you referenced with the culmination of the 27 March announcement? And I would be interested to understand whether the Australian Greens are helping you draft these pieces of delegated legislation, and will there be a public discussion about these things before they are tabled here in the Senate?</span>

As I indicated, the government undertook an extensive process of consultation, including in the earliest parts of this year, following the release of our detailed discussion paper about the approach that we wanted to take. A couple of days ago, on the 27th, Minister Bowen made an announcement about some of the changes that we proposed in response to representations from a range of different stakeholders.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of changes, some of which are being dealt with in the amendment that's before you. It's a single amendment, and I think the impact of that amendment is clear to you. But there are some others that will be dealt with through different means, one of which is that we have made it clear publicly that there will be additional funding available for the manufacturing sector and for trade exposed industries through the Powering the Regions Fund. There will also be a change in the approach and some specific treatment for hard-to-abate value added manufacturing, including a different threshold for manufacturers to qualify for a discount on their decline rate. That reflects the particular characteristics of this sector as a value-adding industry. Those changes would be reflected in the rules rather than the core legislation, and that's consistent with the overall architecture of the legislation before the chamber. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also committed to commissioning a review to examine the feasibility of an Australian carbon border adjustment mechanism. That has obviously been the source of some discussion and an area of some interest for the industries we are engaged with. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the remaining changes are dealt with through the legislation. I would only say that we have, of course, emphasised that the Chubb review remains an area of focus. The government will continue with implementation of the Chubb review to ensure integrity in the carbon market. I am conscious, Senator Duniam, of trying to provide a balance between what is quite a level of detail that will be contained in the rules and material that we can engage with in the debate this morning. Those are the main points and the ways that we intend to progress them.</span>

That is interesting, and we will come back to those specific elements that will find their way into delegated legislation later on in the committee stage. What I do want to know is what modelling the government has done on the financial impact on businesses and households of the changes that have been agreed to with the Greens. I note that you did indicate that most of the changes as set out in the proposed amendments to the legislation are clear. Yes, I'm sure they are, once we get through reading the document, which was only provided to us an hour ago. It will become clear. But what is important as we move forward—and we will have to vote on these things no later than one o'clock tomorrow—I want to know: what modelling has been done about the impact on power prices and the cost of fuel and other sources of energy that households and business would have, and inputs to manufacturing processes? I want to know about any modelling that has been done on the way through as part of these discussions, which culminated in the 27 March decision. Any good government would go and model requests from a party like the Greens to understand whether it was good for the economy or bad. In the absence of modelling of these changes, I am very concerned that we've just signed up for an expedient political deal. So, hopefully you'll be able to tell me that modelling has been done and that it's rather thorough, and perhaps you might provide it to us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, I have one further question on the issue of modelling. Was the modelling that was hidden by the Australian Senate by way of PII claim at any point shown to the Australian Greens as part of the discussions that occurred in the agreement around the announcement on 27 March? Was that modelling that we sought shown to any member of the Australian Greens, any member of their staff or anyone associated with them when it was hidden from the committee of the Senate and indeed the coalition?</span>

                    </a>  Look, these issues were canvassed in Senate estimates. They were also canvassed, as I understand it, in the Senate inquiry that took place into the legislation we're now debating. There are two answers. One is that I think Treasury have provided advice that they didn't do modelling on the impact on the overall economy. Modelling was undertaken on the potential for onsite abatement at safeguard facilities and implications for the carbon market. And, as the minister has said and as has been discussed in this place, this is not only cabinet-in-confidence but also price-sensitive information, as the Commonwealth is the largest purchaser of ACCUs. Regarding the question about whether or not the members of the Greens or staff have been shown this modelling, I am advised that the answer is no.</span>

I would like to understand from your answer—so, Treasury did some analysis of onsite abatement, I think you said? I'm sure you'll have a chance to respond when we come back in the afternoon, because we're about to suspend, I understand. But was any analysis taken by any department or any minister's office—any third party outside of government—around what impact these changes that have been agreed to with the Australian Greens would have on, for example, power prices, fuel costs and inputs into the manufacturing process, such as in industries like the fertiliser manufacturing sector?</span>

I just wonder whether you can indicate to the Senate whether you've gone through the same level of in-depth analysis to assure yourselves of what you're signing up to here to get a bill through isn't going to have a negative impact, given that you've put so much work into making sure that this thing actually works in the way that the Australian government said it should before the election. Again, I disagree with the assessment the government is putting forward here: that it'll improve environmental and economic outcomes. I think it will, in fact, be disastrous on both counts. But, when we come back to the debate a little later on today, I would just like to get an assurance from you that you haven't sold us up the creek with no modelling on the Greens' proposals that you've agreed to.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  With the five minutes I have, I want to put some happiness into what was a dire situation in January this year up at Fitzroy Crossing in the Kimberley in WA. We all know the damage that was done. We know about this once-in-100-year flood. We've seen the wreckage of what once was the bridge across the mighty Fitzroy River. It's gone. We also know that 92 homes have been destroyed. Those of us who work in that part of the world—including you, Acting Deputy President Cox, and Senator O'Sullivan—know that, when we talk about 92 homes, we're talking about a lot of people who have been put out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm happy to say that the state government has been able to access a camp that was donated. That's now being put in place. I'm working with the state government and the people of Fitzroy. What I do, as most people would know, is that I cart second-hand furniture that's been donated up to Fitzroy Crossing and Kununurra. So I'm working closely with the community up there. The end of April will be the time when we can get the furniture up there. I just want to acknowledge that there are some fantastically generous people. I also throw this invitation to Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Cox: if you're around Fitzroy Crossing at the end of April, please pop in, because for me, with this, there has always been no blue, no red and no green. We're all team WA on this sort of stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge some very dear friends of mine. Don Bantock from Bedshed in Osborne Park and Midland and, of course, the greater Bedshed company, particularly through the stores at Joondalup and Cockburn, have donated 120 king- and queen-size mattresses for the people of Fitzroy. Don does this year in, year out, twice a year—and for Kununurra as well. I'd like to acknowledge Sleepeezee. Sleepeezee have donated 100 double mattresses. I'd like to acknowledge some wonderful people I met just recently: Peter and Faye Lynch from Tent City in Victoria Park. They were closing down, and they've donated 100 camper beds, 50 stretcher beds and 50 stackable chairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't thank my dear friend Nick D'Adamo from KEYS Moving Solutions enough. Nick and I have been mates for 40 years now. I started Nick in the transport industry, when I was at the ripe old age of 20 and he was 19. He went on to now own the largest removal company in WA. Nick's been a great partner on our Waste to Wages program up in Kununurra, Wyndham and Warmun. He's also been fantastically supportive of what we do in Fitzroy Crossing. Nick throws one of his removal vans at me, and I run around and pick up the donated furniture. We have a warehouse in Myaree that is Marra Worra Worra's, and we've filled the warehouse with donated furniture, which will be going up at a later date on another run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge a very, very dear friend of mine, Justin Cardaci of Centurion transport. For us West Aussies, Queenslanders and Northern Territorians, Centurion transport is no stranger, with the massive task that it performs, carting freight throughout this nation. Justin donates to me one of the largest prime movers. I have to be honest: I get a bit sooky. I always end up with a Kenworth. He throws three trailers and two dollies at me. He also gives me a fuel card and says, 'Knock yourself out—whatever you need.' I just want to put some perspective around that. When my mates in the trucking industry—thank you, Justin—throw all this gear at me, not only does it take that prime mover, those three trailers and those two dollies out of their circuit for the eight days that I do the run, but they also give me a fuel card. Think about this. Diesel fuel is at $2.30-plus in WA, and my round trip to Fitzroy and back is no less than 5,000 kilometres. At $2.50 per litre at 5,000 kilometres, as a rule of thumb, the triple road train uses a litre a kilometre. Do the sums very quickly, and you will see there are four zeros in the donation on top of that, plus Justin and Centurion provide the three trailers. They not only do that but also run the three trailers out to the depot with their other drivers and prime movers while we load them all up and run them all back to the depot. They don't let me off that easy; I've still got to hook the road train up. You'd think they'd do that for me now at the age of 63! But they do get the third trailer up to Wubin for me. So I cannot thank them and everyone involved enough for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank the Motor Trade Association of Western Australia. In Fitzroy Crossing, Fitzroy Motors, as we all know, lost everything in the flooding. They could not get insurance, because they were on the flood plain. The Motor Trade Association, with Stephen Moir and his members, stepped up to the plate, and they have donated thousands of dollars worth of tools, which I'll be taking up as well. So I thank them all for their generous support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech"> POLLEY</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  Today I am delighted to talk about Friends of Dementia. We had an event here at Parliament House this morning. It's hard to believe, but that friendship group has been going for 20 years. That's a significant amount of time during which Dementia Australia has been driving education and awareness programs through parliament. So I'm delighted to be the co-convener of that friendship group with Nola Marino. I want to give a big shout-out to Professor Graeme Samuel AC for his leadership as the chair and of course Maree McCabe as the CEO of Dementia Australia. To all the staff who helped put on this showcase around technology today, I say thank you very much. If every single day I get the opportunity to talk about dementia and to raise awareness around dementia, then I will continue to do that. It is quickly becoming the biggest killer of Australians. That's a reality. At the moment, it's the biggest killer of women in this country. It will overtake heart disease. So it's very significant. I've had the experience of having a family member with early-onset dementia. I know how that impacts family, how it impacts the economy and the support that is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, I say thank you to Senator Marielle Smith. She brought some wonderful speakers to talk to us last night in relation to childhood dementia. There wasn't a dry eye in that room when we heard a mother talking about her two children, her daughter and her son. She showed us a beautiful video of the two children the day after they had received their diagnosis. Her daughter is now 14. She has the body and strength of a 14-year-old, but her mind and capacity are that of an 18-month-old child. She has lost her ability to speak. Then, having gone through this thus far—and she knows what the end will be, because life expectancy is normally only your late teens—this mother will watch her son go down that same path. So part of my responsibility as the co-convener of Friends of Dementia is to raise awareness. Technology is an additive that will help people on that journey to lead a better life. But we have to educate our nurses, our GPs, our ambos and people in accident and emergency services. They are all wonderful professionals, but the reality is that people who are going into residential aged care or providing that care in peoples' homes need to have a greater understanding of what that journey is all about and how confusing it can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you that this morning I tried out the new goggles that they have. They're always being updated. It's a wonderful experience to put those goggles and earphones on and to try and navigate a virtual reality of being in a bedroom and trying to find your way to the bathroom. You will see the impact that patterned carpet will have when you're looking through these goggles. This is what people who have dementia experience. You see the floor coming up at you and all these bugs crawling around. When you go into the bathroom—I did manage to get to the bathroom; or I thought I did, but I was actually in the laundry—you need to be able to distinguish between the handbasin and the toilet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some years ago, I went to Scotland and I went to Stirling University. Over there then, they had a room set up with all the additional things we should be providing to people with dementia who are still living at home. You need to have a glass door for the refrigerator so they can see that. You need to have proper lighting so you're not actually creating shadows. You need to be able to distinguish, as I said, between the toilet and the handbasin. And the colours that you use in that bathroom or mats on the floor—we would see something as a dark coloured mat, but in fact a person with dementia would see that as a hole. We have to continue to raise awareness. I encourage all those who are listening to this and are in the chamber to reach out to Dementia Australia, take that journey and have that experience. It will give you a greater understanding and, I am sure, more empathy. But we need more money in the budget as well. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  Senators statements is a great time to be able to hear from senators and the issues that they really care about. I am following on from two very good presentations here to the Senate. Firstly, Senator Polley, that was an outstanding contribution that you have just made, and I want to commend you for the work that you do in highlighting the impact of dementia and your support for people that are suffering dementia, not just the patients but their families as well. I recently gave a contribution on this subject. Recently a good family friend of mine tragically passed away. I have seen the ravages of dementia on their family and indeed in my own family. So I thank you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Sterle, your work across the Kimberley and your presentation before was outstanding. You didn't do it just to brag about the work that you do. You would be within your rights to do that, because it's commendable work, but you did it to highlight the support that you've received in providing all those mattresses and providing that support to a community that desperately needs support. I commend you for it. For those that don't know, Senator Sterle and I are co-patrons of the men's shed up in Fitzroy Crossing. I think we're going to miss each other by a couple of days. You're up there later in April and I am there maybe at the beginning of that week. We might just miss each other, but maybe I'll see you on the road train, although I might be in the air. Thank you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak today about the cashless debit card, an issue that is a contested policy space in this place. I want to deal with that here today. We are seeing some big impacts of the abolition of the cashless debit card in communities across Australia where the CDC has been in operation. The government did flag its intention to abolish the cashless debit card as part of their campaign leading up to the election, and they will tell you that they received a mandate from the Australian people to abolish the CDC. I beg to differ, because in the locations where the CDC is in operation the members of parliament comfortably won their seats, and they were all either National or Liberal members of parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting that aside, the fact is that the Labor Party demonised the cashless debit card as part of their campaign. They wanted to run a lie throughout the campaign, saying that the coalition were going to put aged pensioners onto the CDC. It was an atrocious lie, because it was not something we would do. That's something that I personally would cross the floor on. I would never want to see that happen. The CDC was only ever aimed at supporting people that were vulnerable and needed the assistance. Certainly for aged pensioners, who have paid taxes all their lives and are just going about their lives, there was practically no benefit in the CDC for them, unless they chose to want to be on it themselves. That was a voluntary thing that they could do. The Labor Party ran a scare campaign on this. In order to make that scare campaign true they had to double down on their resistance to the cashless debit card, and they sadly made the decision to take it away from communities that were getting some real benefit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting thing is, while the CDC was in operation, I guess we didn't have the counterfactual. We kept hearing from people saying, 'The cashless debit card doesn't work. It doesn't help.' I'd get up here and say, 'You needed to have gone to the communities, like I have, to have seen what they were like before.' You would see that there has been a change. There were many things thrown back and there was dismissal of that argument. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we do have the counterfactual. We know what these communities were like. I certainly know. I spent a lot of time across all of the CDC communities. I saw the difference the card made once it was implemented in Kununurra and the East Kimberley. There were varying degrees of success of the program. It worked particularly well in Wyndham, the Northern Goldfields and Ceduna. It was a little marginal in other parts. I'm prepared to admit that in some other places it wasn't implemented as well as it could have been. But it was having a real impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that the CDC has been removed, we've got that counterfactual. We see the devastating impact of its removal, just like we said we would. I think it's a real shame. And, sadly, the government is dismissing those concerns. Its treatment of people who speak up in these communities is very, very disappointing. We've had people like Pat Hill, president of the Shire of Laverton, dismissed by Minister Elliot as being disingenuous when he talks about the difference it has made in his community. This is a member who's lived all his life in that community . He was elected onto the shire in 1992 and has been the shire president for most of those years, elected by his own community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shire President Hill came to parliament this week with others from around that area—from Leonora as well, and there were councillors here. We had people comment on their appearance here, saying, 'They're just a bunch of whitefellas here.' Marty Sealander's Aboriginal. He was born and bred up that way—Wongutha, I think it is—up in the Northern Goldfields. Yes, he has grey or silver coloured hair now. These visitors were being racially profiled by their appearance. People would say, 'What would they know?' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's Marty Sealander's community. He talked about the impact it was having before and he talked about the impact it's having now that it's gone. Pat Hill was in the papers recently. He said that it's been going downhill since they took the cashless debit card away and it's getting worse and worse. He said the cashless debit card needed to be improved. He wasn't gilding the lily or shying away from the fact that there were some ways it could be improved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to lead a working group, appointed by Senator Anne Ruston who was the minister at the time, to help bring together the technology providers, the banks and the retailers to work to improve the card, because we'd heard there was some stigma attached to being on the card. You have this card and every time you go to pay for goods there's an inconvenience in how you use that technology. It was a little bit clunky. There was also a bit of a stigma attached, because the card looked a little bit different to the other cards that people normally used. So there was an issue there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We worked hard to make sure we resolved that. We brought the banks together, all of them, the big ones, and the big retailers, Coles, Woolworths and the service stations, BP and Shell, and Australia Post. They'd make up probably 90 per cent of people's transactions. We worked to improve technology. We recognised that it wasn't a perfect solution. They were originally trials, but through that work we were able to see that technology improve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pat Hill spoke about that, in his paper, up there in the Northern Goldfields. He said that keeping domestic violence and alcohol abuse under control was the aim. Something has to be done, because: 'We won't have anyone living in our town if things keep going the way they are.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, sadly, has been tin eared to these communities calling out for it to come back, and I really hope it does for the sake of these communities, for the sake of the East Kimberley and for the sake of the northern Goldfields and Ceduna. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> had an article just this weekend saying crime rates were up over summer. Again, it was dismissed by the government saying, 'Oh, it is just because people seasonally come in and out.' Guess what? They come in and out seasonally all the time, and have done for the last four or five years, when we did not see those big spikes. The only difference is that the CDC is not there anymore. I get that it would be egg on your face, but, government, will you please listen to the communities. Listen to the voices of the local people who want to see it returned. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ALLMAN-PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  Often in this place I feel the weight of our duty—our duty to our kids, our duty to young people in our community like those sitting up in the gallery, our duty to future generations. We're nearing the end of March and barrelling through 2023, and there are only a few sitting weeks between now and the end of the year. That's one year closer to 2030, one fewer year we have to dramatically reverse our fortunes and prevent 1.5 degrees of warming. Every minute, day and week that we waste in this place tightens the noose around our collective futures. Unfortunately, wasting time is exactly what Labor seems to be doing. The Labor Party have made their priorities clear: keep their heads down, don't rock the boat too much and try to small-target their way to another election win. Climate change, and the impending crisis, is not and never has been one of their priorities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is completely and hopelessly in the thrall of big business. They are addicted to the millions fossil fuel companies pour into their re-election campaigns, enamoured by the sweet six-figure jobs that they stroll in to after politics and terrified of getting on their bad side. No longer championing the Australian people, the Labor Party are now timid receptionists for the CEOs of Woodside and BHP, tasked with making sure that the real concerns and worries of the Australian people never make it past the bosses' doors. It is a pathetic state of affairs when a party that is in government federally and in every single mainland state and territory is still too scared to stick a toe out of line against their bosses at APPEA and the Minerals Council. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People say that the Greens negotiated with Labor on the safeguard mechanism, but that's not actually the case. We were negotiating with Santos and Woodside and Glencore and Chevron and every other corporate lobbyist with an all-access pass and ministers on speed dial. While the country burns and drowns, these corporations will bleed the Australian petrostate for every cent that they can. The truth is that the Labor government does not care about reducing emissions. It may care about appearing to care, but we shouldn't confuse virtue signalling with intent. How do we know they don't care about reducing emissions? Because, if they cared about reducing emissions, they would have introduced legislation that actually reduced emissions. Instead, we got a reheated and barely tweaked coalition policy that had literally been designed to fail. Think about that: in the face of looming climate collapse, when the fate of the human race hangs in the balance, Labor's keystone legislative response in the wake of the climate election was to regurgitate a bad plan from a terrible government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're out of time, yet Labor are acting like we have all the time in the world, that we can keep strolling along to their electoral time line, rather than scientific reality. They will obfuscate, prevaricate and vacillate until the Torres Strait Islands are underwater and our farming land is arid and the Great Barrier Reef is just a story we tell our grandkids. The politics of this situation are clear: Labor will not do what needs to be done to dramatically lower emissions unless we force them to, and I don't just mean the Greens. Our power in parliament is only as great as the movements that support us outside this building. While Labor has the entire fossil fuel industry and its vast infrastructure of wealth and influence behind it, the movement standing behind the Greens is built on people and mass organising—rallies, protests, strikes, civil disobedience. That's why we need to fundamentally change the power of the duopoly and break the stranglehold the fossil fuel industry has on parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our message is that the fight has only started. This isn't a climate war; it's the apocalypse. We have hope because we know that the people know this and they won't stop fighting, either. We promise we will keep fighting, tooth and nail, to drag this parliament into taking climate action. We dragged the safeguard into actual operation—with emissions likely to go down now, rather than up—by taking a guillotine to Labor's 116 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline. By hook or by crook, we will continue the fight for no new coal and gas. There is no alternative. We fight because we have to do. When I look into the eyes of my grandchildren, Billy and Esther, I know that is the only choice we have.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Like many in this place, I'm a very strong supporter of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice to the parliament. It's pretty simple in my mind. Should Indigenous Australians be recognised in the Constitution? Well, that's a resounding yes. Should Indigenous Australians be consulted on matters that directly impact them? Again, yes. Doing these two straightforward things doesn't diminish anyone else. It doesn't come at anyone else's expense. They're matters of common sense and common decency. Consulting people who are impacted by policy will always result in better informed policies and better informed decision-making. When people have a voice, not only does it deliver better outcomes for those people but it also tends to deliver better outcomes for the community at large.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not only talking about the Voice to Parliament; I'm also talking about people—all people—having a voice at work. That means having a say over your pay and conditions. I put a very simple question to all senators in this chamber: should working Australians have a voice at their workplace? I would hope that every person in this place, regardless of political affiliation, would say yes. If we can all agree that all Australians deserve a voice at work, then I'm sure we can also agree that that voice must be heard and respected. A voice that can be silenced or ignored without reason or consequence is no voice at all, and I hope that we would all agree on that very obvious point. I know there are many employers that agree with that proposition, but, unfortunately, there are some that don't. Some have made it very clear through their actions that they have no respect whatsoever for the right of their workforce to have a voice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Woodside, one of the largest and most profitable companies in Australia. Eight months ago, a majority of the Woodside workforce at its North West Shelf offshore platforms voted to bargain collectively through the Australian Workers Union and the Maritime Union of Australia. Rather than respect the decision of its workforce, Woodside launched 11 legal challenges, which dragged its workforce through the Fair Work Commission for eight months. Each one of these legal challenges was more ridiculous than the last, and every single challenge was thrown out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take Qantas, which illegally sacked 1,700 people because, as the Federal Court found, Qantas did not want its workforce exercising their workplace voice. Qantas has also been prosecuted by SafeWork for sacking Theo, a cabin cleaner and health and safety rep, because he used his workplace voice to speak out about Qantas's unsafe work practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Aldi, the most profitable supermarket in this country. Unlike Coles and Woolworths, Aldi refuses to commit to safe and sustainable standards for its truck drivers and its supply chain. When Aldi drivers and their union representative spoke out about this, Aldi tried to silence them through the Federal Court. Thankfully, Aldi failed to silence its workforce and the court threw its claim out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or take Amazon, the wealthiest company on the planet—a company with a reputation around the world of spying on its workforce, as detailed in the Amazon report by UNI Global, and a company that has invested heavily in intimidating its workforce into not having a voice, including in Australia, where they were caught red-handed spying on workers talking to the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Union. Amazon is a world leader in silencing its workforce, but even they have been borrowing a few tricks from the former prime minister, John Howard. I've seen them wheeling out the exact same line that Liberal Party hacks have been wheeling out since the Howard government. The line I'm talking about is how important it is, apparently, to protect the right of people to not join a union, rather than protecting the right of people to join a union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to call this ridiculous phrase out for what it is. It's a dog whistle to employers like Amazon, Aldi, Qantas and Woodside to crack down on their workforce's voice. When we talk about people having a right to paid leave, we don't talk about ensuring that people have a right to not have paid leave. When we talk about ensuring that people have a right to superannuation, we don't talk about having a right not to have superannuation—of course, unless you're Senator Bragg. When we talk about people having a right to the minimum wage, we don't talk about ensuring that people have a right not to earn the minimum wage—well, except when those opposite defend the right of gig workers to not get a minimum wage, of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way you hear those opposite talk, you'd think there was a crisis in this country of people everywhere being forced to join a union. I shudder to think what that would look like! For starters, according to the ABS, union members earn 32 per cent more than non-union members. That's a gap of $350 per week. Imagine being forced to earn $350 more per week! The last time I checked, our problem isn't that too many Australians are benefiting from highly paid, secure unionised jobs; the problem is that we had a decade of the worst wages and job security decline in the history of this country, thanks in large part of those opposite encouraging companies like Amazon, Qantas and Woodside to vigorously and often illegally engage in union busting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the data actually tells us is that 34 per cent of non-union employees would join a union if they were able to do so. That was a finding of the Australian Workplace Relations Study just recently. That means there are 3½ million Australians who are being deprived of their desire to join a union and to have a real voice at work. As is often the case, the reality is actually the complete inverse of what those opposite are saying. The concept of protecting the right to not join a union is Orwellian doublespeak. But this complete nonsense is now so deeply ingrained in the psyche of those opposite that they've lost the capacity to think about these issues rationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I don't want to single out Senator Hume, who I'm sure is a smart and competent person who legitimately believes she's in this place to help working Australians. But her comments to me at the recent public hearing of the cost-of-living committee were astonishing. At this hearing, on 1 March, I asked a panel of major supermarkets a series of questions about the rates of pay that their workforce receive. These are literally the largest private employers in Australia. Senator Hume, who's the chair of the committee, turned around and admonished me because apparently my questions were irrelevant to the cost-of-living inquiry. In her mind—and I'm sure she was being genuine—the question of wages, the question of how much money you take home, is irrelevant to the cost of living. She said they were industrial relations issues and not relevant to the cost of living. It really does boggle the mind, especially considering that Senator Hume is the shadow finance minister. You might think she would appreciate that when you look at a budget, whether a government budget or a household budget, the amount of revenue coming in is pretty relevant. But, over that side, ideology now trumps reality. All they know is that unions are bad; bargaining power is a made-up construct; you can't have a pay rise when inflation is high, because it's inflationary; you can't have a pay rise when inflation is low, because businesses can't afford it; and, as former Senator Stoker told me at estimates last year, if you're getting exploited at work it's your own fault because you made the choice to work there. And don't worry, because the free market will fix everything. That's their post-truth world.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over here in the real world, we actually need to work urgently on how we can restore a voice for people at work. That means ensuring that loopholes that some employers use to get around collective agreements are closed. That means ensuring that unions have right-of-entry powers to enter worksites. That means ensuring that 3½ million Australians who want to join a union but can't will have the ability to do so. We need to get back to protecting the right of people to have a voice at work. We need to get back to protecting the right of people to join a union.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  The former coalition government had an ambitious infrastructure investment agenda. We were delivering a $120 billion, 10-year infrastructure pipeline of projects providing certainty to help industry with workforce planning and investment. We committed to more than 1,200 major land transport infrastructure projects, we completed more than 500, and more than 300 had started construction under the coalition infrastructure investment that was part of our economic strategy, part of our plan to boost overall national productivity. We invested to build infrastructure in areas ignored by state Labor governments—our regions, our congested outer suburbs and across northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in their last budget, Labor cut infrastructure investment by $9.6 billion. This was the wrong call at a time of high inflation and high cost of living. Thirty-six infrastructure projects were cancelled and many more were delayed, with funding pushed out way beyond the forward estimates, begging the question of whether they will ever be started. Of course, many of these delayed projects were for regional infrastructure intended to enhance freight efficiency and support delivery of products to ports and markets. Often, as is the nature of rural electorates, they were in coalition seats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also cut road safety programs in the budget, with $60 million stripped from the Black Spot road safety program over the forward estimates and more than $280 million in road safety program funding originally scheduled for this year deferred by the Labor party. They talk a big game when it comes to infrastructure, transport and road safety, but the numbers don't lie. That is the fact out of their first budget in October. These road safety cuts come at a time when road fatalities are continuing to rise and the Australian Automobile Association is calling often the government to urgently act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the minister released the legislation to amend the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008, and the bill confirms Labor's intention to shrink the infrastructure priority list. Minister King has made it clear she plans to hollow out or streamline the list of infrastructure projects. I said last week we can expect a further partisan purge of planned road and rail upgrades which were funded under the previous coalition government. The minister was critical of our government's increase in nationally funded projects on the infrastructure list during her speech to the CEDA Infrastructure Conference last Friday. She wants to do less. The minister is softening up the public and industry leaders for further savage cuts to infrastructure projects and, potentially, road safety funding in the upcoming May budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> Further, Minister King's reforms seem designated to shackle Infrastructure Australia to endorsing projects that are proposed by Labor governments around the states. It might suit them, but it's not a good sign for communities wanting to see Commonwealth driving the states to deliver more infrastructure, particularly when it's the Commonwealth taxpayer who is funding the majority of the bill, not the states. They want to see these projects delivered in a timely and cost-effective manner. The further we push these projects out, the more they're going to cost. As we're seeing with some of the regional project funding, they are having to be rescoped or councils are having to give back the money because they cannot afford the increase in costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through her consultations with state governments ahead of the October budget, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government delivered significant project cancellations, cuts and delays. In Victoria she agreed with Daniel Andrews that there was $1.1 billion in projects cancelled and a further $1.6 billion in cuts and delays to projects over the forward estimates, right across Melbourne and right across regional Victoria. In New South Wales there were $300 million in projects cancelled and a further $2 billion in cuts and delays to projects across the forward estimates. In Queensland the Palaszczuk government agreed that there would be $2 billion of cuts and delays to road and rail projects, including the $200 million cut to the Sunshine Coast rail project. Here in Canberra there were almost $86 million in cancelled projects, and in Western Australia there were $539 million in cuts and delays to road projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key critical road projects cut in Western Australia was pushing out the upgrade to the Tanami into the long grass. If you talk to the trucking industry in WA, if you talk to the Kimberley group of councils, which I had the privilege to sit down with this week when they came to Canberra, that is their No. 1 of this government for the upcoming May budget. Instead of kicking out that funding of that upgrade of that critical road, which will make it safer for truckies, require less maintenance so they make more and ensure the freight task into rural and remote areas into the NT and Western Australia is serviced, that is a critical project that needs to be brought forward. We will see if Minister King can convince the Treasurer that this is a critical project, because when they last had the chance they cut it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Continually cutting back on infrastructure will be a handbrake on economic growth and a barrier to driving the national efficiencies that are needed for budget repair and tackling inflation. At the very time the government's budget repair strategy should be to invest in productivity-enhancing capital and to cut back on unnecessary recurrent expenditure, Labor seem determined to do the opposite, dooming our nation to a very long, slow and painful recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's lack of infrastructure ambition represents a plan for gridlocked city streets, unsafe regional freight routes and less family time at home for both our transport industry workers and commuters. Indeed, it seems the only infrastructure the government is interested in is the white-elephant projects of state Labor premiers, whether it's the massively underfunded suburban rail loop in Melbourne, for Daniel Andrews, or a $2.5 billion live music venue in Brisbane, for Annastacia Palaszczuk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition also made significant investments in regional airports through the Regional Airports Program and funding to support security and screening infrastructure and operations. There's every indication that these programs will also be cut in the upcoming May budget—no new money. The former coalition government saw the importance to the economy of a bold infrastructure agenda, investing in future growth and tackling decades of underinvestment by state governments on the infrastructure needed to support population growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen this week the government lean in a forward manner towards increasing our population significantly. You cannot pour hundreds of thousands more people into our capital cities without pouring hundreds of millions of dollars—billions of dollars—into critical road projects to support that population growth. It doesn't make sense. The Productivity Commission handed down a report on infrastructure, and we know that, while the industry is stretched, inflationary pressures are placing tremendous pressures on project delivery. These pressures, combined with a lack of action from the federal government, are leading to project slippage. As I said, we have a 40 per cent rise in the cost of reinforcing steel and structural timber. If the Greens have their way, we won't have Australian timber to use in the construction industry. It will be from overseas. Industry surveys and interviews indicate that the cost of construction materials has risen 24 per cent, on average, over the last 12 months. Labour—the workforce—are seeing wage increases in excess of 17 per cent in the last 12 months. The cost of labour within public infrastructure has grown by that much over the last 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of infrastructure to the Australian economy was highlighted by the Productivity Commission. Thirteen of the 71 recommendations of that report were tangentially or directly related to the infrastructure portfolio or transport. The fact that Jim Chalmers, the Treasurer, dismissed that report of hand shows that the government are not really interested in investing in productivity-enhancing infrastructure. They're more interested in cuts and delays which will cost our economy over the future. The Albanese government appears bereft of ambition or vision, lacking the understanding of the contribution that infrastructure can make to our economy and to building a stronger, safer, more sustainable and more prosperous Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  The $4.5 billion per year National Indigenous Australians Agency has been quick to deny it's been developing demands to be made by the Voice to Parliament which were revealed in a letter sent to my office last week. I remind the Senate of what some of these demands were: Aborigines paying only 50 per cent of the rate of income tax; Aboriginal groups owning beaches and national parks and charging the rest of us to use them; 10 per cent of all judges, magistrates, police officers, ADF officers, vice-chancellors and ambassadors being Aboriginal; no entry tests and no fees for Aborigines going to university; 50 per cent discounts for Aborigines going to sport and music events on public land; Aborigines having first claim on all public housing in Australia; a reduced age of eligibility for the age pension for Aborigines; rivers and streams being owned by local Aborigines who will charge the rest of us for water consumption; the same for mining royalties; all new liquor licences to be vetted by the Voice; and the Voice office being the same size and having the same budget as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As I said, the NIAA has been quick to deny this action list for the Voice, and no wonder. If any of these demands was met, 97 per cent of Australians would be made second-class citizens based solely on race.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, minutes of government organisations' meetings with Aboriginal groups around the country, obtained through a freedom of information request, show these sorts of demands are being discussed. These include exclusive sovereignty for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over lands and waters; the creation of a new Aboriginal state with its own constitution from land under native title; a treaty or treaties recognised in the Australian Constitution; racially exclusive designated seats in parliament, reserved only for Aborigines; Aborigines receiving a fixed percentage of all Australian gross national product; Aborigines being exempted from paying land tax; funding for the Voice to Parliament being generated from percentages of land and water taxes; funding for Aboriginal bodies and programs being linked to reparations for theft of land; creation of a black parliament; a race based rent tax from an open chequebook; race based inherent rights for Aboriginal people in the Australian Constitution; renaming more towns and landmarks after Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the creation of sovereign wealth exclusively for Aborigines; Australian taxpayers funding the preservation of Aboriginal languages; the Australian flag being changed because it symbolises the injustices of colonisation; statues of explorers being torn down; Aboriginal traditional ways of life being enshrined in the Constitution; the curriculum in all schools being changed for non-Indigenous Australians; Australia being decolonised; and fee-free access for Aborigines to sport and recreation, including free sporting equipment. Like the demands contained in the letter sent to me, many of these would make most Australians second-class citizens in their own country. The $4½ billion NIAA has been actively discussing them with Aboriginal groups for years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the dangers of putting a Voice to Parliament in the Constitution. For these and many other reasons, Australians must vote no in Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Labor's racist referendum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I need to also say this here. I've read out a lot of these claims, and a lot of people would identify with some of these demands, because they're already happening—the tearing down of statues and the welcome to country. I am sick to death of hearing about it. I refuse to acknowledge it. A lot of Australians ask me, 'Why should I be welcomed to my own country?' That in itself is ridiculous. With Aboriginal names, we can see the changes that have happened over the years, and they're still changing and wanting change. Flying the Aboriginal flag in this place wasn't put to the Australian people at all. We've just accepted this flag that was brought about in the 1970s, with no authority from the Australian people. To fly it here in this parliament, without the vote from the Australian people, is appalling. I'll tell Australians this: get ready for a very rocky, racist way of life that we will experience if the Voice gets up.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  As a member of the previous opposition, I was very passionate about housing policy in this country. I spoke many times in this chamber about the need to invest in social and affordable housing. That's why, as a member of the Albanese Labor government, I'm so incredibly proud of our policy to deliver the Housing Australia Future Fund to Australians, to make sure that we can have more affordable and social housing and investment in the housing that we really need across the country for vulnerable Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the one thing standing in the way of us delivering the Housing Australia Future Fund is the Greens political party of this country, which is standing in the way of this sensible, important investment. We've seen the politics of this issue on display this week. We know that those opposite, the Liberal-National opposition, have again dealt themselves out of the negotiations. So we are seeking to get agreement to this legislation, but the Greens political party is standing in the way of investment into housing, including social housing, for everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me explain what this legislation does. It is the single biggest investment in affordable and social housing in more than a decade. That is what the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will do. In addition to the 30,000 social and affordable homes that will be built over the next five years from this fund alone, there is additional funding here for really important things that matter. This is what the Greens are standing in the way of. From this investment we have $200 million for repairs in remote Indigenous communities and Indigenous housing, something that is desperately needed and has been called for by people in those communities for years now. That is the investment that the Greens are standing in the way of. We know that part of this investment includes $100 million for crisis housing for women fleeing domestic violence. I don't know how the Greens have managed to justify standing in the way of $100 million of crisis accommodation funding, but that is what they are saying to the Australian people they don't support. It also includes $30 million for veterans housing. It is incredibly important at this juncture in time, when we do have pressures in our housing system, that we take care of the people that have taken care of us. That $30 million for veterans housing is what the Greens political party are seeking to block when they stand in front of this legislation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the thing that really is astounding about the position that has been taken by the member for Griffith in the other place, but also by Greens senators in here, in standing in the way of this legislation is that it is supported by the housing and homelessness sector. The Greens are ignoring the pleas of the very people who are dealing with the housing crisis right now. When this announcement was made, there were people who came out and supported it: Anglicare Australia, Mission Australia, St Vincent de Paul, the Australian Council of Social Service and, of course, the Community Housing Industry Association. They all said, when we announced this policy in opposition, that this was an important step forward that needed to be delivered. But now we have the National Shelter, Homelessness Australia, Community Housing Industry Association and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Housing Association also calling for this bill to be passed by the Senate. They are pleading with the Greens to put down their political weapons, to stop making their memes for social media and to find something else to campaign on because this is too important to stop. We know that, if you want more funding for affordable and social housing, the worst thing you could do is block more funding for social and affordable housing. That's exactly what the member for Griffith is doing in his calls to his Senate colleagues to stop that. The Greens political party is stopping investment in housing.</span>

I am here to stand up for those people that need housing and don't need homelessness, and the Greens are not. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I commend the BrainTrack app from Dementia Australia to anyone who's interested. It is a new piece of technology. It has already helped diagnose people with dementia. I think it's a great piece of work by Dementia Australia. I want to endorse the words of Senator Polley and demonstrate clear bipartisanship in support of the work of Dementia Australia, which is really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue that I do want to talk about today, and it was my intention in it taking this position, is in relation to business of the Senate formal motion No. 1, which is a reference to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. It's in my name and in the names of a number of colleagues. It's in relation to a reference for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representative organisations. I think this is very important reference, and I would have preferred to have been able to debate it later, but the fact is that the change in the way the chamber is operating today means that that's not possible, so I take this opportunity now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first question I ask, rhetorically, is: how did this motion come about? It came about due to some appearances by some of these organisations at Senate estimates prior to Christmas. There was a very concerning performance at Senate estimates. The committee offered some training to those organisations, and I have to say they took that training up and the resultant process was very good. But, at the subsequent Senate estimates, we had ORIC come in and place some information on the table in their opening statement that I think was genuinely very concerning, and that goes to their reporting process. One of the things that we do in estimates is scrutinise the spending of Australian taxpayers' money. This is what the opening statement said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… reporting compliance across Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations is unacceptably low, with 28% of corporations who have failed to meet their reporting obligations for two years in a row.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How is that acceptable? ORIC works with these organisations to remind them. The reporting obligations are not necessarily burdensome; they're catered to the organisations themselves. They have 371 corporations that are currently being deregistered. But then the opening statement goes on to say, '999 corporations have failed to lodge annual reports for both 2020-21 and 2021-22,' and, '829 corporations have not yet lodged 2021-22 annual reports.' If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is. This is a serious reference, and I don't understand why this can't be dealt with immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have crises in our Indigenous communities. We see it on our televisions every day. I have to say it is beyond me. It is tragic. It is tragic that we appear, because the government doesn't want to have a look at this, to be unable to deal with it. Why can't we be looking at the real problems? I'm not saying the Voice is not real. Don't get me wrong; I think it's a very important debate for this country. But why is it not possible for us to start looking at, dealing with and fixing the problems that are clearly reported in ORIC's opening statement in Indigenous communities across this country? We need to ensure that the taxpayers' money that is being provided to those organisations by Australians is doing the things that it needs to be doing. Why is it not possible to do that? I think it's completely and utterly lamentable that we may be in a position this afternoon, when the vote comes, where we will not be permitted to undertake what I think is a very, very important piece of work for this Senate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I wish to speak about the ongoing horrors of police violence and brutality in this country. The police are an armed branch of this racist, colonial project who have persecuted First Nations people and queer and trans people of all skin colours since colonisation. They have been carrying out the genocide against First Nations people for 250 years—a genocide which continues to this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The police don't care about the safety of First Nations people or the safety of trans people. They care far more about upholding colonial systems of control and oppression as they uphold the illegal and violent occupation of land that always was and always will be Aboriginal land. Yet we still march alongside them at pride marches, accept their continually increasing presence in First Nations communities and turn a blind eye to the ongoing brutality and violence committed against marginalised groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first pride marches were born out of the Stonewall riots, which were protests against colonial laws that tried to force the queer community into corners. They were led by black, brown and white activists from across the LGBTIQ+ community and were protesting against the ongoing violence being perpetrated by this system. The first Sydney Mardi Gras in 1978 was a march in solidarity with these protests and was met with significant resistance and violence from the New South Wales Police. Despite police intimidation and brutality, the 78ers took to the streets to demand equal rights and to stand united in a show of love and peace for all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mardi Gras has now become completely corporatised and lost sight of those origins. I stand with those in the queer community who are calling for no cops in Pride. I disagree with the police marching in Pride and do not accept their presence in the name of diversity as they continue to lock up First Nations people, murder our people in custody, steal our children and prosecute queer and trans people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a genocide that has never ended in this country. Such behaviour is not welcome in LGBTIQ+ communities. It's not welcome in black and brown communities. It should not be welcome in this country. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up three per cent of the national population, yet we are the most incarcerated people on this planet. This is no accident. The overpolicing of our communities has continued since colonisation, and our people continue to die at the hands of police and corrections—a genocide that never ended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every change for our community, every win, has come through protest. We would not be where we are today without the courage and commitment of the 78ers and other black and queer activists who have risked their safety to demand equal rights and an end to ongoing systemic violence. The recent antiprotest laws in New South Wales work to silence us and uphold the colonial systems of control and oppression. These laws are a breach of our basic democratic right to protest and our fundamental civil liberties. They aim to uphold existing power structures and silence grassroots activists fighting against this violent and oppressive colonial system. We will not be silenced. Our people have fought for justice since colonisation, and I will continue to fight for an end to the ongoing systemic violence and discrimination perpetrated against First Nations people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300706" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BABET</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">United Australia Party Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  While Australians are closely watching the Reserve Bank's movements on interest rates each and every month, there is another activity of the Reserve Bank that demands our close inspection. In August of 2022, the RBA quietly announced a year-long study of central bank digital currency. This should concern every single Australian who values freedom. Under the guise of improving efficiency, the RBA study of a centralised digital currency is in fact a study on how to better regulate and control the lives of ordinary Australians. It is a study of how the state can replace cash in free citizens' pockets with a digital currency that is completely controlled by the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although similar to the money that you have in your net bank right now, one of the key differences is that this currency is based on blockchain technology and, as such, is programmable. A more accurate way to think about this currency is a digital voucher or a coupon. The state can decide where you can spend your money and what you can spend it on. It can set an expiry date on your money and do a whole lot more. The fact that the CCP is excited by the potential for a central bank digital currency is a huge hint that this is not something that Australia should be pursuing. So why are we contemplating this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The World Economic Forum, under the leadership of the unelected, Bond villainesque Klaus Schwab, have already declared their intention to provide citizens with a carbon allowance. We need to be given a carbon allowance, you see, in order to save the planet—how convenient! A central bank digital currency is the way in which such an allowance could be enforced upon every person on the planet. We are rapidly coming to a time where the state will replace people's cash—money citizens can spend as they wish, when they wish, on whatever they wish—with a digital currency that can be spent only as a state controlled central bank will allow. Why would we contemplate a world in which governments could freeze your spending on certain items because you have potentially reached what they deem is a safe carbon allowance for the planet? Why would we contemplate a world in which the state can determine how you may spend and what you may spend it on at all?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you don't have the freedom to buy and sell as you wish, then you don't have any freedom at all. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that governments, declaring that they must tackle some sort of financial crisis, demand that you spend your money in your account within a certain period of time before it expires. Remember Klaus Schwab promising that in the not-too-distant future we will own nothing and be happy he wasn't joking. Anyone who doubts the World Economic Forum's intentions or the reach of their tentacles into governments around the world has not been paying attention. Klaus Schwab, after all, did say he has penetrated the cabinets—those are his words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A central bank digital currency would allow increasing levels of control over our nation by globalist organisations to program our money to literally disappear if it is not used within a certain time frame, thus ensuring we are unable to save and therefore unable to build generational wealth. A central bank digital currency, as is right now being considered by our very own RBA, is a high-tech way of turning citizens into slaves of the system. Eventually cash may be banned, and there will be no buying or selling without the express permission of the government—no true freedom at all. It was a dark day in 1932 when our nation's currency departed the gold standard. This began a process of reducing our trust in our own currency. CBDCs will make it easier for reserve banks to create and to control money, and it will undermine our trust even further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If my parliamentary colleagues here in this place are serious about representing their electorates, then, rather than merely waving through a very clear globalist agenda that robs people of their freedoms, they should and must oppose the idea of a central bank digital currency with every fibre of their being. Some will say that this a conspiracy theory, but it is not a conspiracy theory. The RBA is very closely examining this right now.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Indigenous Austr</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">alians and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate some commentary recently—even as recent as in Senators' statements—on the Voice here and in the other house. I remind senators and members of parliament that words matter and that the commentary and the hysteria being shown towards First Nations people and, in this instance most recently by Senator Hanson, in terms of the NIAA is uncalled for and totally wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's really important that here we have an opportunity in the Senate to call for evidence based issues and documents to come forward. A lot of the accusations I've heard in the Senate today are completely disgraceful. I reject outright the words of the senator, for starters. I would say this for the staff who work in the NIAA: you keep doing your job for the people of Australia. We have a significant moment in this country to do what we can to improve the lives of First Nations people. The government is following the path that we took to the election. These kinds of slurs and allegations against the staff of the NIAA are not on and are most unbecoming of a senator in this place. Bring forward your evidence and bring forward your allegations in the appropriate manner instead of casting aspersions against the credibility of those who work in the Public Service for this parliament and for this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to the Senate: the hysteria that I've heard does not help Australians in this country. I would expect better of senators and parliamentarians—to lead in a manner with the most respect. We do not have to agree, but we can certainly have our conversations in a manner that does not scare everyone else in this country. I remind Senator Hanson that the world will not cave in; the sky will not fall down. I remember having this conversation with you over the closure of the climb at Uluru. I invited you to Uluru when that decision was made. That decision was made by the Uluru-Kata Tjuta Board of Management. It was a comprehensive vote by those board members and the Anangu people to close that climb in 2017, and in 2019, when it did occur, I accept that you went there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to remind you that this journey towards the Voice and towards the referendum is also a similar journey. Do not be afraid. The sky will not cave in. We can have conversations here without denigrating people, without rubbishing people, without scaring people and certainly without making allegations that are unfounded and untrue and that cause hate and horror to fester and flow. That's not what this is about. That's not what the Senate should be about. I would remind senators and members of the other house that we have a fair way to go. The Prime Minister said that the referendum will occur between October and December. Let's conduct ourselves in a most dignified way. As I said, we don't have to agree, but we can certainly put our points in a much more appropriate way.</span>

The Save Sorry Business campaigners are a small group of people in number, but they are the voice for more than 13,000 Aboriginal policyholders of the failed ACBF/Youpla funeral fund. Senators will recall that the Aboriginal community funeral benefit fund collapsed in March 2022, leaving more than 13,000 Aboriginal people from across our country—some of them elderly and in palliative care—without the financial means to pay for family funerals. The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund, which was not Aboriginal controlled or run, sold junk funeral insurance plans to Indigenous people across Australia for more than 30 years. Innocent people, choosing to make responsible financial planning decisions for themselves, have been let down by financial regulations and by financial regulators in Australia. Some people have lost not a little bit of money but up to $40,000 of their savings. The Save Sorry Business says:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Earlier this afternoon, Senator McKenzie continued to spread mistruths about supposed cuts to road safety spending. I am so tired of the Liberals' and Nationals' attempts to politicise road safety, so I will say once again, in the hope that Senator McKenzie may be listening, that there have been no cuts to the Mobile Black Spot Program, because this government takes road safety seriously. The Albanese government is continuing the precedent of budgeting $110 million towards the black spot program each year. Any unspent funds are simply rolled over into the following year's program, on top of the $110 million allocation. I would hope that, as a former minister within the infrastructure portfolio, Senator McKenzie would know that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its first budget, in October last year, the Albanese Labor government committed $9.6 billion in infrastructure spending across the country. The black spot program is just one of the fantastic and meaningful infrastructure initiatives funded by the Australian government to curb deaths and trauma on our roads. It is disappointing, but hardly surprising, that Senator McKenzie has chosen to spread fake news instead of working collaboratively in supporting regional communities. Communities have been a political football for the coalition for far too long. The black spot program targets road locations where crashes are occurring. It shouldn't be used as a political football.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Over the weekend, my friend Jonathan Sriranganathan announced he would step down as councillor for Brisbane's Gabba ward. Jono was elected in 2016 as Queensland's first Greens councillor, and the first of Sri Lankan Tamil heritage. He's a musician, rapper, writer and former youth worker. But I've known Jono first and foremost as an activist—shaking up the system, telling it like it is, asking questions that no-one else would dare ask and challenging you to think really deep and hard about so many issues. He is a radical, unwavering voice for the community he serves and for the social, environmental and racial injustices we face—one that refuses to back down, no matter what the hurdles are. I am in awe of Jono's courage to put his security and his body on the line to protect others and for what he believes in. Politics needs more people like that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He achieved so much positive change for a more sustainable and equitable city. But Jono's influence has been much wider than Brisbane. He set an example for what meaningful grassroots engagement is and played a pivotal role in transforming the Queensland Greens into a powerful movement for change. The 2022 'Greenslide' owes so much to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jono's departure is a big loss, but thankfully the amazing Trina Massey is stepping in. She will be the first openly queer woman of colour ever to hold public office at any level of government in Queensland. Representation is important, and I can't wait to see Trina in action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm looking forward to your next adventures, Jono. Thank you for your extraordinary work. Thank you for being such a good friend and such a staunch ally for people of colour. Please keep asking the hard questions. You truly are one of a kind.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Last week a group of brave women in Victoria gathered to protest men using their bathrooms and dominating their sports, and, as sure as night turns to day, the activist media and the leftist political hacks of this nation described it as an 'ugly, evil, harmful gathering', never even seeking to distinguish between the nitwits who showed up in black and the genuine female protesters. This is just emotional manipulation designed once again to shut down debate. If the Left actually cared, they'd consider the reasons for the higher rates of mental health problems, rather than using it as a threat to shut down and silence women.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Have they ever entertained the possibility that telling children that they can change their gender might be dangerous to their mental health? These people claim to care about safety but care nothing about the harms being caused to women and children, with increasing reports of women in prisons across the world being sexually abused by men who identify as women. Where's the outrage for them? Where's the outrage from the Left over the biological man who rushed the stage at the Let Women Speak event in New Zealand and threw tomato juice at Kelly-Jay Keen? Where's the outrage from the Left over the church shooting in Nashville, where a radical trans activist shot and murdered, amongst others, a three-year-old girl?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pay close attention to the way in which the term 'harm' is weaponised. The activist state and their allies in the censorship industrial complex are gaslighting you. It's time the sycophants of the Left started to consider the impact this is having on women and on people who are trying to raise their kids, with the activist state trying to divide families and sexualise our children. </span>

Our ODA funding has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people in developing countries. Our government, the Albanese government, recognises this potential and the impact of a strong ODA program not just to deliver life-saving assistance and economic development but to directly contribute to the stability and resilience of our own nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why under the Albanese government we have already begun rebuilding Australia's official development assistance program. On top of existing funding, we've expanded our Pacific Step-up commitment with an additional $314 million. This is in stark contrast to the previous government, whose failed Pacific Step-up program was funded by gutting funding in every other area. This resulted in more than $11 billion being slashed from our ODA budget, and this contributed, frankly, to the strategic setbacks in the region and the strategic challenges that we've had in competing for influence and contributing to stability. We've also lost specialist skills and knowledge on that as a result of the last government's decision to merge DFAT and AusAID. I'm really proud of what our ODA funding is now focused on: poverty reduction, education, humanitarian crises, economic and infrastructure development, empowerment of women and ultimately DFAT's capability to deliver life-saving assistance. </span>

We have an unprecedented housing and rental crisis. We don't have enough homes for everyone in Australia. Rental vacancy rates are lower than one per cent in our major cities. In my home state of Queensland homelessness has increased 22 per cent in five years. Increasing numbers of Australian families are living in tents and sheds and caravans and on the street, and we have a Labor government which refuses to do something to fix this crisis and which is actually making it so much worse. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper reports that we are experiencing the biggest two-year population surge in our history. The Albanese Labor government is allowing 650,000 new immigrants into Australia this financial year and the next. That is more than the entire populations of Canberra and Darwin combined. Australia cannot accommodate all of these new people. Australia cannot contain these record numbers. Australia is bursting at the seams. Australia is full, and so are our hospitals and schools. We already have a shortfall of almost 700,000 homes for the people who are already here. Labor's pathetic housing future fund, if it even gets up, will make absolutely no difference. 30,000 homes in five years—what a sad joke. Labor is deliberately making the housing crisis even worse. Labor's record high immigration is literally forcing Australian families to live on the streets, and winter is coming. The net zero we must be prioritising in Australia is a net zero immigration, not net zero carbon dioxide. We must stop this flood, or we will all drown. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I too was shocked to hear the news this morning that 650,000 new people would be coming to Australia this financial year. That's more than double what we would typically consider a big number of migrants into our country. We typically used to say that 300,000 was a huge amount of migration. I want to be very clear: I support migration. We have a long history of welcoming people from other countries. I myself am the product of that. But we have got to put Australians first. And we don't have enough housing for people who live here today. So why is this Labor government running migration levels at double the amount of what would be a high number, when we do not have enough housing for Australians? This Labor government came to power saying they wanted to increase wages. They wanted to help workers get a better deal. How is that going to happen when we're importing all of this cheap labour from overseas, competing against those that are the poorest in our society and keeping wages under pressure and not keeping up with inflation? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation will only get worse if we take in more and more people without having adequate services to provide for them, because we will have more competition for the scarce amount of goods, and that will push up prices and push down real wages. How has this Labor government allowed this to happen? This is totally against what they promised the Australian people. We didn't hear any of this. Did anyone hear Anthony Albanese say that he would double our migration levels in his first year in office? He said he would lower power bills by $275. I heard him say that 97 times. I didn't hear him say once that he would double migration levels in the country. The housing crisis we are all seeing in front of our eyes is a direct result of the mismanagement of our borders by the Labor government. The Labor government has to get in control of our borders and make sure they put Australians first and make sure we decide how many people come to this country and when they come, because it is our nation and we should look after Australians first. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Today I want to talk about a megafracker that is currently on its way from the US to Australia. This is one of five megafrackers that Tamboran intends to use to frack the Beetaloo basin, against the wishes of traditional owners. GetUp have estimated that it could arrive in late April and be in use by the second half of this year. This is, of course, if Tamboran can gather the extra $1 billion a year they will need to offset their emissions from day one, which has been one of the great wins the Greens have secured for the safeguard mechanism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This megafracker has the capacity to drill for more than four kilometres in multiple directions at once. This is nothing like what we've seen here in Australia. In fact, this piece of machinery has a capacity two to four times that of anything that is currently approved in Australia. This means that the impacts on climate, water, the environment and cultural heritage are greater too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory and federal governments need to complete an independent assessment of the increased risks of this megafracker. There are outstanding recommendations of the Pepper inquiry that have not been implemented, and the use of this machinery will ruin any chance of some of these inquiry recommendations actually being met. The import and use of these rigs must not be permitted in Australia. This sets a dangerous and unacceptable precedent that we cannot afford in the middle of a climate crisis. At this time, we need to be moving away from the fossil fuel industry. </span>

There is a sense of calm and order as the Victorian people go about their everyday lives. The media are silent. They don't know what to say. What's different? Our Premier has gone on a little holiday to visit, for the seventh time, his good friends to the north.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Premier Andrews has not truly disclosed the purpose of his travel to the People's Republic of China. It has been left to us to speculate on his itinerary. I for one hope that our dear Premier has taken it upon himself to personally investigate the origins of the Wuhan virus or maybe to negotiate the release of the persecuted Uighurs from re-education camps. Maybe he could be standing up for hardworking Australian wine and barley exporters suffering from brutal tariffs. The cynics say he could be looking to rekindle the failed Belt and Road Initiative deal, or maybe he's seeking to prop up our heavily indebted state, projected to reach around $170 billion of debt in just the next few years—more debt than Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania combined. Not one Australian journalist was invited to accompany the Premier, but I'm sure the state run Chinese Communist Party press will do their best to reveal the truth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the Premier should leave international diplomacy to our federal government. It's not his job, and when it comes to previous experience there is no one more competent at international travel than our own Prime Minister, Anthony 'Airbus' Albanese. The people of Victoria are left to pray that our dear leader will return safely having not sold us out to the communists again. </span>

After her mother, sadly, passed away, she was adopted by Wilfred and Lucy Swift and their daughters—Alison's sisters—Audrey and Amy. She remained grateful to her family her entire life. She grew up in Areyonga and Hermannsburg enjoying her childhood surrounded by friends and family. Alison was a much loved grandmother and aunty. She had committed her life to Johnny and to her three children: Julieanne, Kathleen and Steven—who, sadly, passed away in 2020. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alison was a real leader in her community and was described by her family as a 'fierce, outspoken woman' who was not afraid to fight for what she believed in. Alison's life was about bringing people together. An excellent communicator, she dedicated her life to helping people understand each other, to closing the gap and to inviting people from all walks of life to understand her culture. </span>

Just about every person who has stopped me on the streets in Lonnie has mentioned how tough things are at the moment. One in two Tasmanians are facing food insecurity right now. One in five Tasmanians are regularly skipping meals and going hungry. And it's only getting worse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I visited Loaves and Fishes in Devonport. They're a food bank who feed 17,000 Tasmanians every single week. They give food to public schools so kids can have a hot, healthy meal. They give food to the Neighbourhood Houses all over the state. They provide food to homeless shelters. Loaves and Fishes help a lot of people across Tasmania, but they're feeling the cost-of-living pressures as much as anybody else. Their electricity prices are through the roof, and that means less money for food. The cost of fuel for food delivery just keeps going up. And guess what? That means less money for food. The cost of each meal they make has skyrocketed from 80c per meal to $4 per meal. This means they're not getting as many meals out the door. As the number of meals they make decreases, the demand for them only increases. They're feeding more people with less money. I'd like to see the Tasmanian and federal governments do more to support food banks like Loaves and Fishes. The work they do is so important, and in the current housing crisis we need them more than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We could also be doing a lot more to minimise food waste. If charities, schools and governments work together alongside supermarkets, farmers and restaurants, I think we'd be amazed at what we can do. We need to hit the ground running to make sure support gets to where it's needed most. I don't want to see anyone left without a meal because food bank resources are stretched too thin. If we're not helping people, what are we here for? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that police are much more likely to use violence against blakfullas than others, yet they have never, ever been held accountable. The police are supposed to be your friend and helper, yet to our communities police intervention is not helpful at all. Most of the time, they do nothing but cause more harm. Aubrey's community is demanding to know what happened. Why shoot to kill? There are many other ways to de-escalate a situation. We need to hold police accountable and not let them get away without consequences. </span>

What happened to Aubrey is yet another sign of this country being in a deaths in custody crisis and again underlines the need, after 32 years, to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody so that the underlying factors of this crisis can be addressed. We cannot allow any more lives to be lost. This government can act, but it just won't.</span>

I remind them that sometimes it can be tough. We see wall-to-wall Labor governments across Australia with their alliance partners, the Greens, and we all suffer from the hubris they now represent, the arrogance and the overreach we're seeing from Labor-Green alliance governments right across Australia. </span>

I'll take them back to 2007, to the loss of government by the Howard prime ministership. We saw wall-to-wall Labor right across Australia. We saw the same hubris, the same arrogance and the same overreach. Within a very short period of time in WA—Senator Sterle, you'll remember this very well—we saw one of those arrogant, overreaching, hubristic Labor governments go to a sneaky election during the Olympics, and, against all the polling and against all the odds, we saw the Barnett Liberal government be the first domino to fall in a return of Liberal, National, LNP and CLP governments across Australia. I say to those opposite: rumours of our death are greatly exaggerated. I say to all our supporters out there: the Liberal Party will come back, and we will get rid of this arrogant, hubristic government at the next election.</span>

                  </a>  Listen to this, you lot. You might learn something, you ignoramuses! Today, there is a delegation of workers from the transport industry here in Canberra. They are being led by the Transport Workers Union, with state transport organisations and with employers—big employers. They've all come together to tell the story of the danger that we are facing in the transport industry in Australia. It's called the gig economy. So far they've had 38 meetings, and gig economy workers have had the ability to share their stories with members of parliament and with the crossbench. I don't know if anyone from that side has actually taken the opportunity to go and talk to these people who have been injured with no compensation because of the greed of the gig economies. I've got to tell you, they're here and the industry is united.</span>

I'm going to keep an eye on a lot of you, but I'm going to challenge you, Senator McKenzie, because I want to know where you stand. You are following me around the nation, speaking up a real big fight on how good you lot over there are going to be for transport. When I deliver speeches and when I talk to the road transport industry, I don't have bits of paper in front of me written by someone else. I don't need that. I actually know what I'm talking about. So I really cannot wait to see you squirm under that desk when you follow those major corporations who donate to you and you give the middle finger to the united front of the Australian transport industry—and it ain't the Australian Trucking Association. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">red)</span></span>

I've just been looking at the monthly inflation figures that have been released today and at the rate of 6.8 per cent in the month of February, which is lower than the 7.4 per cent rate reported in January 2023. But I don't think it's any surprise—and I've been saying for some time in this chamber—that one of the significant challenges facing the budget and the decisions we are taking in relation to the budget is how we deal with the inflation challenge, how we provide sensible cost-of-living relief where we can without adding to the inflation challenge across the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That requires us to show some restraint—where we've got revenue upgrades, to look at how we bank those upgrades. In October we banked 99 per cent of those upgrades in the first two years, and I think it was 92 per cent over the four years. That gives you an indication of the fiscally responsible way that we will go about making these decisions, and we're doing that against the backdrop of increasing pressures on the budget, whether from defence, from the NDIS, from health, from aged care or from some of the terminating measures—cleaning up the mess that we are also working through and have been talking about in this chamber this week. So, you'll see the budget when it's released, but the question Senator Bragg asked of me is certainly front and centre in the minds of all of us who participate through the ERC process.</span>

Obviously in relation to the NRF that has passed the parliament, with Rewiring the Nation, we are moving on that through the Powering the Regions Fund. The Housing Australia Fund hasn't passed the parliament, so we won't be in a position to establish that fund until it passes the parliament. There will be some expenditure, I would imagine, once those funds are up and running. We'll report that in the normal way, as you would expect, once those decisions have been taken.

I don't have the IMF report in front of me, but I think those opposite—well, I don't want to say they've verballed the IMF—have used the IMF report selectively for political purposes. My recollection of the IMF's report is that it talked about being mindful of the impact of establishing funds and being cautious about the use of them, and that's exactly what we were doing. In fact, if we go back and have a look at when you were in government, you established quite a number of those funds in a similar way that we are doing now. We are using them to drive a common good, whether it be in housing, in manufacturing jobs, or in ensuring we've got an energy grid that actually works for the renewable energy future that Australia will have to have. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In agriculture, forestry and fisheries, in resources, in transport, in medical science, in renewable and low-emissions technology, in defence capability and enabling capability, the National Reconstruction Fund will revitalise and strengthen our local supply chains to ensure that we have our own industrial and manufacturing capabilities. It will invest in businesses so that they can invest in their workers, developing the skills that we need now and into the future. We got to this point by working together with the crossbench, and I congratulate them because, when the coalition stepped back, the crossbench had to step up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The amendments the government made to the bill addressed a number of other important matters that have informed our design of the National Reconstruction Fund from the outset: attracting private sector investment, not crowding it out; achieving Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and decarbonisation; creating secure jobs and a skilled and adaptable workforce; enhancing resilience in Australia's supply chains; and, of course, encouraging the commercialisation of Australian innovation and technology. In making these amendments, the government reaffirms that one of the most important outcomes of the National Reconstruction Fund will be the creation of secure, well-paid jobs in key industries that build on our national strengths. </span>

When we proposed the National Reconstruction Fund in March 2021, Labor said we were going to do this to rebuild secure work because we know a strong domestic manufacturing industry provides opportunities for Australians to make a meaningful high skilled contribution to our nation's future. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly 85 per cent of jobs in manufacturing are full time, and it's a shame that the coalition didn't get this message. They were opposed to creating new jobs in their communities. They were opposed to local manufacturers, just like they were opposed to the car industry in this country. The only jobs they're ever interested in are jobs for their mates. With the passage of the National Reconstruction Fund, the Albanese Labor government will create jobs that communities can be built around, especially in regional, remote and outer suburban Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The legislation that's currently before the chamber, which was debated into the early hours of this morning and is being debated through the day today, is part of that. That is about dealing with the significant challenges we have in transitioning into the renewable energy superpower that we would like to be, which we will do without your help. The legislation will ensure that we are moving to renewables, that we're rewiring the grid, that we're supporting households with the transition, that we're supporting jobs in the transition, that we're supporting regions in the transition and that it's an orderly transition—or as orderly as it can be after a decade of delay and dysfunction from those opposite. That's what we're doing. We're doing exactly what we said we would do, and, where there are the challenges of the day, like a war in Ukraine that's increased prices around the world, we're dealing with them despite the opposition from those opposite.</span>

I reject the assertion being put forward by Senator Colbeck, and I would similarly say to those opposite: why did you hide the electricity price increase before the election? What was that about? Was it because you didn't want to tell people? Was it because the member for Hume actually didn't want people to know that under your watch, with all of the energy leaving the system and not enough being replaced, there was going to be a significant increase in electricity prices? When you got confronted with that news, what did the member for Hume do? He hid it until a few days after the election. We are being upfront with the Australian people. Where there are challenges—we've seen them; we saw them in December, and we saw them in the budget—we've responded responsibly and carefully, and all those opposite did was oppose it, just as they oppose everything else we do.</span>

Every week I hear heartbreaking stories about students struggling to put food on the table, pay for medicine, afford a train or bus ticket, pay bills or pay rent. One 19-year-old Queensland University of Technology student said that she has not eaten fresh fruit and vegetables for at least a month and relies on instant noodles. She struggles to afford period products. At UNSW, hundreds of students are lining up in queues for free food. This is causing intolerable financial stress and mental health impacts for students. Can you look these students in the eye and tell them that you can spare $254 billion for the wealthy and $368 billion for war machines but nothing for them?</span>

I reject the suggestion that our government is doing nothing to assist students or low-income earners generally. In fact, it wasn't that long ago that, for instance, we brought the parliament back to support legislation to support price caps on coal and gas prices and provide energy price relief for low-income earners, including for the very students we're talking about. Of course we, the Albanese government, also delivered cheaper medicines, which started on 1 January this year, which students and many others, including pensioners, would benefit from. As I recall, it was the first reduction in PBS prices, if not ever in Australian history then certainly for a very long time. That is in addition to a much broader range of cost-of-living relief that the government is providing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that you pointed out, Senator Faruqi, was that many of these students are renters. I certainly remember my renting days as a student, when you don't have a lot of money. As I've pointed out on a number of occasions this week to the Greens, there's a very simple thing that the Greens could do to assist us to meet the need for more social and affordable housing in Australia, and that is to back the Housing Australia Future Fund that our government is putting forward. The hypocrisy of the Greens is yet again on display when it comes to housing. On one hand, they're out there claiming that we need more social and affordable housing, that we need support for renters and that we need more housing for renters, and then, on the other hand, when there's a government that's actually prepared to do something on this topic, what do the Greens do? They say, 'No, it's not good enough.' They vote against it again. It is actually within your power to do something about this—about support for affordable housing—to bring down the cost for students. But, instead, you'd rather have a protest out the front and yell at people. That's not the way to help people.</span>

Nearly a third of students work more than 20 hours a week. They are telling us that it is impossible to just be a student and enjoy uni life, because they can barely afford to live. Too many students are living in poverty. Will the Labor government assure people there has actually been a change of government and raise the rate of income support payments to at least $88 a day?</span>

I've already listed a range of ways the Albanese government is providing cost-of-living support to support a range of lower-income earners, including students. Some of the fundamental issues that cause student poverty, which is a real issue and has been for a very long time in this country—one of the key causes of that is the extra cost that students are having to pay for accommodation. It is within the Greens' power to do something about this. Maybe, just for once, the Greens could think about being part of the solution to deliver on the things they're complaining about, rather than thinking much more about having a protest out the front where they yell at people and ask for things that can never be delivered by any government in Australian history.</span>

They can't keep up because student debts are now going up faster than they can be paid off. Will the government intervene urgently to ensure people are not hit with an obscene increase in their student debts on 1 June?</span>

As Senator Faruqi may be aware, Minister Clare, the education minister, has asked his universities and higher education accord team to look at the issue of student debt. It's also important to explain the way that HECS and HELP works. It's not like a home loan or personal loan from a bank, where if interest rates go up your payments go up; it's built on an important principle that people pay what they can afford, and people don't pay more unless they earn more. That is the way the system has always worked. I remember Senator McAllister and I having debates about this when we were university students, about the right way to charge student fees. It's been an issue for a very long time. I'm not sure we were on the same side necessarily, Senator McAllister, on that! But we all grow and change our minds—even people like you and me!</span>

We know, after almost a decade of cuts and neglect from those opposite, it's never been harder or more expensive to see a doctor. Our government is being upfront with Australians about the state of our health care system because this crisis didn't just spring from thin air or happen overnight. It's the result of decisions made by the former government—a former government whose priority was to cut Medicare.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of funding critical health programs, they chose to put hundreds of measures in the budget on a time line to be cut. For example, the My Health Record system, a system that looks after the health records of 23 million Australians, runs out of funding on 30 June this year—no money for My Health Record. For 23 million Australians' health records, they just switched the money off. There is no money for public dental and adult dental services beyond 30 June. Do those opposite honestly think that adults will not have dental problems on 1 July this year? That is really the reason why they would budget for them in this way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't be surprised, because the Leader of the Opposition was, I think, voted the worst health minister in 35 years in a poll of 1,100 doctors, because he wanted to put in place a GP tax, he wanted to increase the price of medicine and he even wanted emergency departments to start charging for seeing people. That is what we had under those opposite, and we are getting around to cleaning up the mess that has been left behind.</span>

As problems emerge, as departments bring forward their terminating programs, we are working through those. We are also implementing our policies we took to the last election, to invest in the health care of Australians. For example, lowering the price of medicines came in on 1 January, making a difference to the cost of living for millions of Australians. The Strengthening Medicare Taskforce has a significant budget to invest in Medicare, and we're getting on with the job of investing in and opening those 50 urgent care centres. This is what you do when you're a government that believes in Medicare and believes in the strength of the health system.</span>

Senator Wong, in a question time in September 2022, I asked you a question in relation to immigration. In response to the question, you said Labor had increased immigration to 195,000 per year as a consequence of capacity constraints in the economy. Will the minister please explain to the Australian people why Labor has let immigration blow out to a record 650,000 this financial year and the next as reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> today?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think my response to you, Senator Hanson, was referring to the net overseas migration figures. I am advised that the increase in net overseas migration is 304,000 for the year ending September 2022. There is also an increase in planned permanent migration in 2022-23 which, of course, is a commitment from the Jobs and Skills Summit. I'd make the point—and I assume my answer to which you're referring was making the same point—that we obviously do have some capacity constraints in the Australian economy. In fact, ensuring that we have an appropriate level, particularly of permanent migration, is one of the ways we can grow our economy and one of the ways in which we can ensure that some of those capacity constraints driving inflation are dealt with.</span>

There will obviously be a balance of questions that the government has to address, which go to skills shortages but also to some of the issues that we've been discussing for some weeks now, including availability of housing supply, but the government will always make decisions on migration in the national interest.</span>

I would make the point that one of the reasons the government wants to bring forward the Housing Australia Future Fund is to ensure that we can contribute to greater supply. It is, I think, very deeply concerning that in the face of some of what is occurring in the housing sector that we have the no-alition—those opposite, who I know are struggling with the reality of opposition and are very angry, as is evinced by the sorts of interjections we get—simply saying no and the Greens saying it's not enough and, as a consequence, there are people in this country who would be benefited by increasing housing supply, which may be left wanting. Of course, always more can be done, Senator Hanson, and I think we all understand that. And, as I said, these are some of the issues the government will grapple with. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

This government went to the election with a very clear policy, a set of policies, around increasing the supply of housing—because we on this side of the chamber care about social housing, we care about improving access to decent housing and we care about what is happening in the rental market. And we understand that one of the key ways in which government can do that is to— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time exp</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ired) </span></span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much, and can I thank Senator Reynolds for highlighting the mess that they left us. I really appreciate it. I've been looking forward to dorothies on terminating measures. I didn't expect to get a dorothy from Senator Reynolds on terminating measures. We went through and made decisions, in the time we could, for October. We were elected in May. We went straight into putting forward the October budget. We did what we could. I think we indicated at the time that there was more work to be done. And there will continue to be work to be done, as we uncover these issues, as agencies bring them forward, through the processes of the budget, and we deal with them. Because that's what responsible governments do. Responsible governments don't have zombie measures propping up their budgets. Responsible governments don't fail to address pressures that are about to hit the budget. Responsible governments do it the way we are doing it.</span>

You will see the government working carefully to deal with those. They are a significant pressure on the budget, and they will contribute to significant expenditure in fixing them up.</span>

My question is regarding First Nations people targeted by Youpla funeral insurance. Many now cannot afford to bury their loved ones, many of whom are sitting in morgues. We've had elders sitting in morgues for two months because of the scam insurance company. The Albanese government, through the Minister for Indigenous Australians, committed to providing a resolution to those impacted by this scheme. The October budget did include some money but only affected a small percentage of people, which is now going to run out on 30 November. When will the Labor government end the trauma and suffering of tens of thousands of Aboriginal people who have been ripped off by this scheme? I understand it is not in the May budget. Why not? </span>

We have been working through all the issues around providing support to those that have been affected. As at 17 March 2023 the program has received 220 applications, with 186 of these being approved, and the program has paid out $1.5 million in grants to 170 recipients to support First Nations families in conducting sorry business. </span>

I would say to Senator Thorpe that we are working as fast as we can. We recognise the awful situation many people have found themselves in with the collapse of Youpla, and we are trying to work as hard as we can to make sure that we can resolve it for all of those that have been placed in this terrible position by the failure of this business.</span>

That's some small, if any, comfort to the elders sitting in morgues right now. There are 170 people you've supported. We've got more than 10,000 to 20,000 people that have been affected. What solutions are you actually pursuing to get elders out of these morgues and ensure that a fair, enduring and culturally appropriate resolution is reached for all of those impacted?</span>

But I can absolutely tell you the government has had a number of conversations about Youpla and the collapse and what it means for those who have passed and their families. That is why we moved as quickly as we could to provide assurance that we would deal with the families involved, including those that had passed away and were in morgues. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I thank Senator White for the question. Recently, when I was in Darwin, my staff and I were following a Land Cruiser along the Esplanade that had a Do it for Dolly sticker on the back. It reminded me of the harrowing experience of Dolly Everett, which no child should endure, and the work that has been done since then to improve online safety. I do give the former government credit, as does the Prime Minister, for the work they did in this space. Maintaining online safety is a core priority for the Albanese government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we are supporting the eSafety Commissioner, Australia's independent regulator for online safety, particularly as the eSafety Commissioner undertakes critically important work to raise the bar for online safety and hold platforms to account for their actions to keep Australians safe. Whether it is tackling online child sexual exploitation material, combating cyberbullying and harassment, or making dating apps safer, I think we can all agree that the work they do is critical for our society. However, I think senators would be astounded to know that, despite the eSafety Commissioner's important role, eSafety has been operating without funding certainty—thanks to decisions taken by those opposite.</span>

You're right. All week we have highlighted examples of the former government's deliberate design feature of funding cliffs throughout the budget. In my own portfolio of agriculture when it comes to biosecurity, emergency management, eSafety, My Health records—the list goes on and on where this government thought that miraculously the whole world would change on 1 July and important permanent functions were not going to need ongoing funding. This is another example of it.</span>

Again, we could have a discussion about the funding cliffs that were littered throughout the budget that was run by yourselves in agriculture and infrastructure departments and things like that when it came to funding. But of course the future of all projects in the infrastructure portfolio will be revealed when the budget is revealed. I know we're about to enter that period where we're going to see scare campaign after scare campaign from the opposition about what may or may not happen in the budget. But we've actually got a government in place now that has responsible budget practices—rather than funding cliffs, rather than booby traps, rather than mirages of back-in-black budgets that turn out to be not so back in black at all. We're not out there preparing coffee cups, unlike some.</span>

I can also tell you that, unlike certain other people in this chamber and in this parliament, the Albanese government and our ministers will not be using colour coded spreadsheets when it comes to allocating infrastructure funding.

I mean, there are so many rorts you forget the numbers. But this government actually takes the use of taxpayers' money seriously. We intend to use it transparently and honestly. That means we will fund projects that are not in Labor seats. What an incredible suggestion that would be! What an incredible suggestion, to have a government that is prepared to allocate money on the basis of need rather than on what colour they're coded on a spreadsheet.</span>

                  </a>  I can assure Senator McKenzie and all Australian people that they can rely on the Albanese government to make targeted infrastructure investments in a fashion that we haven't been used to over the last 10 years. As I was saying, it was a Labor government that invented Infrastructure Australia to overcome the rorting of infrastructure budgets we'd seen from the Howard government. We've now had to restructure Infrastructure Australia because it had been distorted by the stacking with Liberal Party and Nationals mates under the former government. There's a bit of a pattern here, isn't there? Every time there's a Liberal-National government, it's stacking with mates, it's rorts; every time Labor comes in, we have to clean up the mess, and we're doing it all over again. </span>

Senator Gallagher has reminded me about the funding that is going to be provided for Olympic infrastructure that is going to be happening in the great city of Brisbane, in the great state of Queensland. Where did that funding first come from, Senator Gallagher? Was there some commitment made by the former government about that? Was it the Liberal-National government that was going to contribute 50-50 funding to the Olympics? Was it just the Liberals who supported Olympic infrastructure funding and not the Nationals, or was it some of the Nationals and not the Liberals? Seriously, work out what page you're on. You are here asking us about funding that your own government committed to do. </span>

                  </a>  I withdraw. Unlike some of my colleagues here, I will withdraw unequivocally. But I will say that we come in here with a government who hides behind a litany of broken promises, untruths told to the Australian people during the campaign, and come in here unable either to answer a question or, when they do utter a sentence in any form or format, it is constantly heavy on politics, heavy on excuses and very short on a plan. I might point out to those opposite that for Australians who are about to come off their fixed mortgage rates, who are about to require $12,000 to $20,000 a year, depending on the size of their mortgage, when they're looking to this federal government to provide them with some guidance, a plan, cost of living support, all they are hearing from you is petty political point-scoring that is actually based on falsehoods. No-one opposite remembers the pandemic. No-one opposite remembers that our economy came out of the pandemic 3.4 per cent bigger than it was going into it; that the cash rate was 0.35 per cent; that we had lower unemployment coming out of the pandemic than we had going into it; that we had strong GDP growth and in fact we were one of the few economies that maintained an AAA credit rating. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So perhaps a history lesson is required, and not even a particularly lengthy history lesson, because it wasn't that long ago. It wasn't until you lot took the helm that the wheels completely and utterly fell off. But instead of putting together a plan, instead of doing some work, there has been a constant cry that 'Government is hard and boo-hoo, we didn't get it right.' The fact that we heard from the finance minister prior to the October budget—for those listening or any of those in the chamber, this government actually has had a budget—so when they talk about budget and issues in the budget, this is their budget that contains the issues, because they have had a budget. It wasn't an economic forecast; it wasn't a statement; it was a budget with lots of budget papers. We all got them delivered to our offices and we went through them, and then we had lots of budget estimates in a follow-up to Labor's budget. But we did hear from the finance minister time and time again—I'm not sure if it was 97 times; we might have to go back and check. During the election we heard 97 times that power prices were going to go down by $275, but we now know that wasn't true and that's not going to happen, to the point that when Senator Farrell was asked 'Can you just say the number 275', he declined. It's not that hard, people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't know if the finance minister said it 97 times, but she said an awful lot that she was going through the budget with the treasurer line by line. What does that mean? Does that mean she opened it up and flicked through and had a quick skim? We were told time and again that line by line this was going to be gone through. Is it incompetence? Is it inability to look into detail and understand what's written in the budget papers? How is it now that we have those opposite coming in and talking about mistakes they made in their own budget—mistakes they made when they, the ones in charge on the Treasury benches, could not go through a budget, didn't know how to look at programs, didn't know funding through to the forward estimates? This whole line that you're all wheeling out about fiscal cliffs—we know that none of you sat through economics 1.01 for may be more than half a lecture before it all got too hard, because that is the level of economic comprehension that's demonstrated day by day by those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Terminating measures are a common tool used in a budget by responsible governments. It's just the way they work. I'm sure we will see in the May budget that those opposite may actually be employing similar methods, but, when they do it, it'll be completely different because it's just the way the budget needs to be reported. It's the way budgets are done, and you have had your budget. Your budget was in October. You missed it. You goofed it. You got it wrong. You're not up to it. You can't get across the detail. Do you know who's paying for this? The Australian people. You're not giving them a plan. You're giving them excuses and petty politics, which we saw from your frontbench today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  We welcome the opposition's questions about our government's responsible approach to managing the budget, our approach to cleaning up the mess that was left behind by those opposite and our approach to dealing with the trillion dollars of debt that they left behind, with absolutely nothing to show for it. We welcome your questions about our approach to dealing with all of that while we get on with our plans: to build a better, stronger future for all Australians; to support Australians with the cost of living; to deal with the energy mess that was left behind after 10 years of complete denial and delay from those opposite; to build a strong and diverse economy, making more of what we need right here in Australia; and to build an economy that is powered by cheap and clean energy—a decarbonising economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, though—and every week—what we see from those opposite, the former government, is that they are all about saying no: saying no to the good ideas that we took to the election; saying no to the good plans that the Australian people supported at the election; saying no to safeguarding our climate; saying no to safeguarding jobs in regions in transition; saying no to even being part of the conversation about how we do that; saying no to rebuilding Australian manufacturing and making more of what we need right here; saying no to building more social and affordable homes for those in need; saying no to homes for 4,000 women and children escaping family violence—can you believe that the coalition is saying no to that?—saying no to funding for urgent repairs to Indigenous housing; and saying no to capping power prices last year, after they said no to telling the Australian people before the election that prices were indeed about to rise. Right now, the coalition has been reduced to being the party of 'no'—no to being a viable party of government and no to even being a viable opposition.</span>

We know that it is hard out there for people. That's why our investments are so important: our investments in households, industry, the economy, the future of our country, cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, fee-free TAFE, putting downward pressure on energy prices and getting more renewables into our grid.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures are not only things that help households and businesses; they are also part of our plan to drive inflation down. We've been talking this week about our plan to strengthen and diversify our economy, to rebuild manufacturing through the National Reconstruction Fund—a plan that is supported by everyone except for the opposition. It's a plan that is all about creating the jobs of the future. It's a plan that's all about making more of what we need right here in Australia. It's a plan that is all about securing our supply chains in critical sectors, like medical manufacturing and defence. It's all about making sure that we grab the job opportunities for the future for regions that are in transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But who opposes that plan? The coalition—the opposition—opposes that plan. They oppose the jobs of the future. They oppose jobs in regions. They oppose taking advantage of the jobs in renewables and low-emission technologies that we know are the future for our country. They also oppose plans supported by the rest of the parliament to create the safeguard mechanism. This is a plan that industry supports, a plan that industry is keen to play its part in. What people want is certainty. What they want is support. All they're getting from those opposite is, 'No'.</span>

                  <a href="263528" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator NAM</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">PIJINPA PRICE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  Yes, we hear a lot about plans and we see very little action. And yes, we will continue to oppose and say no to bad policy. We heard earlier my colleague Senator Colbeck asking Senator Gallagher about the October budget's forecast—a 56 per cent increase in electricity bills for Australian households over the next two years—and whether the government believes that the actual increase will be higher or lower than that forecast. Senator Gallagher, however, did not simply give an answer to the question, instead informing this chamber that the budget figures would be updated in May and then taking the opportunity to try and lay blame at the feet of anyone else. Telling us that the figures will be released at a later date is not answering the question, but then I don't expect anyone from the other side to answer any questions legitimately. We still do not know whether the government believes that their October budget forecast is in fact accurate. Instead of taking responsibility for the decisions of the Labor government that have contributed to the rising cost of living for Australians now, Senator Gallagher and the Labor government would rather hide the answer from Australians and hide from their responsibilities. This has clearly become the norm for this government—breaking promises and then hiding the details while throwing the blame on everybody else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government cannot continue to run from their broken promises. They cannot continue to try to lay the blame at the feet of past governments when their own policies simply do not work. At least 97 times before the election the government promised that it would cut Australians' electricity bills by $275. Of course, they cannot even bring themselves to say the number 275. But not only has the government been unable to deliver on that promise; they have also overseen price increases. They've overseen the contribution of massive pressure and stress on the budgets of Australian families and will continue to do so as they pursue their renewable energy utopia. The reality is that energy prices are predicted to continue to rise at brutal rates that will have real consequences for many everyday Australians come this winter. This is no doubt partly due to the Labor-Greens attack on cheap and reliable energy sources, such as coal, gas and oil, sources of energy that will still be required to back up the Green dream of 100 per cent renewables so that when the wind stops blowing and the sun goes down Australians will still be able to heat their homes and live their lives. While Labor and Minister Gallagher dream of becoming a renewable energy superpower, Australians continue to struggle with the extreme cost of their decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that renewable energy sources like solar and wind are not cheap, they are not reliable, and they are not powering Australians into the future. They are expensive, add extreme costs and pressure to the grid and leave Australians vulnerable to energy poverty and related dangers. Labor needs to acknowledge this cost to the transitioning and be up-front with the Australian people about the pressures that will come with it. Instead, the Labor government continue to lay the blame on everybody else and anything else to avoid taking responsibility for their own failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was discussed in great detail in the early hours of this morning, the previous coalition government had reduced emissions by 20 per cent on our 2005 base level and put Australia on track to beat our Paris treaty commitments. The previous coalition government had met and exceeded Australia's Kyoto targets. The previous coalition government had committed to a net zero target by 2050 while working to ensure the energy security of Australians—delivering cheap and reliable base-load power to reach a cleaner future while also ensuring Australia remains strong, prosperous and independent. Can the government please stop providing all these grandiose plans, and can the Australian people see action to reduce their electricity and power prices.</span>

                  </a>  As always, Deputy President, I don't intend to hurt anyone, but certainly filibustering is an accurate description. Regardless, my point is the quality of the questions we had today in question time from those opposite. We'd expect it from some others, predominantly those on the crossbench—with the greatest of respect to them—but the quality of the questions that we had from the coalition today was quite outrageous. We had minister after minister providing answers to questions that were put to them, particularly around inflation, the cost of living and spending, but the coalition senators have been ignoring the fact that this government, having been in power for less than one year, has had a hell of a job of trying to fix up the mess of the last decade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's always important to put the facts on the table. I know those opposite, particularly three of my favourite senators over there, love facts on the table. My first question is: who racked up a trillion dollars of debt and had nothing to show for it? It was the coalition. Who had a spike in power prices just before the last federal election and didn't tell voters about it? It was the coalition. Who spent almost a decade deliberately putting downward pressure on wages growth? It was the coalition. Who also spent almost a decade telling the automotive industry to go away and not invest in domestic manufacturing here in Australia?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people decided: 'We want a change of government. We're going to voting for an Albanese Labor government, which will invest in health, education and jobs and make sure our sovereign capability gets back up to scratch.' Now that the Australian people have made that choice, those opposite come in here, every single day that we sit, and lecture us. They lecture the government while we try to clear up their mess, and they try to pretend that their mess never existed. They're embarrassed about the problems they created. They don't want to take ownership of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that we were here till very late this morning—4.15 to be precise—listening to contributions by those opposite on a number of bills that we had before this parliament. A tip for those opposite, particularly the Nationals and Liberal colleagues: being in opposition is hard; I understand that. It is always hard being on the losing side. I get that. I was there for three years, but I learnt a lot. By learning a lot, I'm now on this side of the chamber, with my lovely colleagues, implementing reforms and making changes in the interests of working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a senator, I value working with everyone across the chamber, as you would all know. I think it's actually much healthier for democracies, for parliaments, for chambers like this Senate, when we are actually all working together in the national interest, rather than the sort of short-term political point scoring that we see from those opposite. But the coalition makes it very, very difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect that when they get up every morning they go to their tactics and say: 'Right; how are we going to say no to Labor's policy reforms? How are we going to say no to making the lives of working people better?' Their tactics must be fascinating, because they're having to deal with not only those in the sensible centre but also those on the fringes who are constantly against the interests of working people. When this government comes into this place and has an approach, how do we work with senators? I hate to say it to those opposite, but the only common sense we're getting at the moment is from the crossbench, who are willing to sit down and work with the government to tackle the cost-of-living issues, to tackle investments in manufacturing and also to invest in the very people that elected us to this great place. </span>

                  </a>  I will take the interjection from Senator Duniam—a government who runs from accountability and runs from transparency. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ciccone touched upon the very important debate that started last night in relation to the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2023. It is disappointing—it is actually quite sad—that the journalists and people in this building were not able to hear my contribution at three o'clock this morning, because it was a very good contribution, if I may say so myself. This is what this government is about. They're using the guillotine like mad members of revolutionary fronts. They are guillotining everything because they don't want transparency and they don't want accountability, and they do not want the opposition to be able to use this chamber as the appropriate mechanism by which to analyse and discuss our views on a very, very challenging piece of legislation. It was disappointing that members of the Liberal and National parties were forced to give their speeches beyond the witching hour, and that is sad. It shows the arrogance of this government, who will do dirty deals in the dark, dirty deals behind closed doors, dirty deals done behind closed doors with darkened windows, in relation to the governance of this country but also the management of this chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is particularly disappointing about question time today and the debate last night is that the No. 1 issue in Australia at the moment is the cost of living. The Labor Party and their coalition partners, the Greens, fail to appreciate how the cost of living is hurting Australians. And their solution is not just a new tax, the carbon tax 2.0; it is a giant, throbbing tax, a massive tax that they're going to pick up in their hands and chase after every Australian and every Australian family and whack them over the heads with. What we've seen from this government is that they're giving a giant wedgie to Australians through their secret deals with the Greens, and that is wrong. It is wrong that they would treat Australians so poorly. It is wrong that they would treat this chamber so poorly when it comes to allowing opposition members to question giant wedgies—because that's what the Labor government are doing to Australians: giving everybody a giant wedgie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they're failing to let us question is the wedgie that is coming with people's power bills. This government promised 97 times before the last election that it would cut your power bills by $275—97 times. It wasn't that the Prime Minister had a verbal burp and accidentally said something. This was a deliberate tactic. They get into power and, instead of cutting your bills by $275, what the October budget showed was that power bills are going to go up by 56 per cent over the coming months. This is the modern Labor Party. They talk about the light on the hill, but guess what: there is no light on the hill, because people can't afford to pay the power bill for the light on the hill. This is how the modern Labor Party have sold out working Australians and businesses across Australia, and this is why we will spend every day, every hour and every minute making sure that you own what happened last night and this morning in this chamber.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Watt) to a question without notice I asked today relating to support for students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every week I hear heartbreaking stories about students struggling to put food on the table, to pay for medication, to afford a train or bus ticket or to pay bills. Week after week, students who are already battling to pay their rent are being hit with rent increases from greedy landlords. Students are working multiple jobs, cutting back on necessities and still barely scraping by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard about the severe financial stress and the mental and physical toll that these daily pressures are taking on students. One 19-year-old QUT student says she hasn't eaten fresh fruit and vegetables for at least a month and relies on instant noodles. She struggles to afford period products. At UNSW, hundreds of students are lining up in queues for free food. Students are trying their best, but they still can't make ends meet, and this government is effectively telling them, 'We can't afford to support you but you won't believe what we can afford for the wealthy: $254 billion in tax cuts.' This is a government that has turned its back on young people and students. I can't remember a time when the students were doing it this tough, and it should be clear to anyone with a conscience how difficult it is to be a student at this point in time. People are electing Labor governments because they desperately want change, but Labor is looking away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor could choose to raise the rate of income support payments to $88 a day and lift students out of poverty. Labor plays a big game on housing, but Labor's housing bill does nothing for renters, and it will see the shortage of affordable and social housing actually grow. Labor could take immediate steps to relieve the burden of student debt by freezing indexation and raising the minimum repayment income. Student debt is already locking people out of the housing market, stopping them from getting married or starting a family, and crushing dreams of further study. Student debt is stopping young people from living the carefree, fun lives that all young people should live. It's stopping them from enjoying university, pursuing hobbies, socialising with friends and just having a good life. Student debt is having a disproportionate impact on women because they earn less and they have more debt. And it will get much worse in June, when student debts are set to be indexed by seven per cent. Millions of Australians will be hit with more debt. They can't keep up, because student debts are now going up faster than they can be paid off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many people have spoken about rising student debt, and I want to read out some of what they have said: 'I often wonder how long it will take me to pay off my debt. My husband and I are barely able to keep up with the rising cost of living. Abolishing indexation at the very least would help lessen the pressure of living expenses and help me catch up with paying off this burdensome debt.' Another one says: 'I doubt I will be able to keep up with the indexation. Mostly I just feel stupid for believing what I was told as a child—that I needed to go to uni for a good job—only to end up with a debt that goes up by $2,500 a year.' Another one says, 'Now we are seeing nothing but increase, increase, increase. With those increases, they don't understand that it not only affects physical health; it removes resources and access to so much, and it stigmatises low-socioeconomic students.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, the government is sitting on its hands and saying it won't do anything because the university accords process is underway. Well, that's not good enough. This process and its implementation will take years. People are struggling now, and they need relief now. This government can abolish indexation and raise income support payments. We have a progressive parliament right here that can waive through these measures to support students. Labor is actively choosing not to provide support for those struggling the most but can give $254 billion to the wealthy in tax cuts and commit another $368 billion for nuclear attack submarines. These choices make it clear that, when it comes to substance, we still have a neoliberal government which chooses austerity for people and the planet and abundance for billionaires and the war machine. Be better, Labor.</span>

                    </a>  I rise as the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Anti-Corruption Commission to speak about the committee's report on proposed appointments to the National Anti-Corruption Commission. The committee was recently established to provide parliamentary oversight of the forthcoming commission.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the National Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2022, one of the committee's roles is to consider the Attorney-General's proposed recommendations for the appointment of commissioner, deputy commissioner and inspector of the commission. On 10 March 2023 the Attorney-General referred to the committee proposed recommendations for the appointment of the Hon. Justice Paul Brereton AM RFD as Commissioner on a full-time basis for a period of five years, Ms Nicole Rose PSM as Deputy Commissioner on a full-time basis for a period of five years, Dr Ben Gauntlett as Deputy Commissioner on a full-time basis for a period of five years and Ms Gail Furness SC as Inspector on a part-time basis for a period of seven years. I'm pleased to report the committee has unanimously approved each of these proposed recommendations. This enables the Attorney-General to recommend each of these appointments to the Governor-General. This is indeed momentous, as these are the inaugural appointments to these positions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today, the committee wrote to the Attorney-General to inform him of this decision and I am now tabling this report for the benefit of all senators. The committee's task, which was to approve or reject the minister's proposed recommendations for certain appointments, is uncommon among parliamentary committees. I thank committee members for approaching the task thoughtfully. The committee undertook significant due diligence to assure itself of the suitability of the candidates. This included consideration of the qualifications for an appointment that are set out in the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To allow committee members to properly carry out their due diligence, the committee notified the Attorney-General that it required additional time to consider his proposed recommendations. Considering the government's intention to ensure the commission commences operation by mid-2023, I'm pleased that the committee members worked promptly to conclude their deliberations without using all of the available time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I wish to thank the candidates for putting themselves forward to lead the commission when it is established later this year. This is indeed a momentous task, given the crucial role the commission will perform in Australia's integrity framework. I also wish to thank the Attorney-General and his department for providing information to support the committee's deliberations. The committee looks forward to the commencement of the commission later this year and to providing ongoing oversight in accordance with the act.</span>

                    </a>  I start by thanking all the members of the NACC committee but particularly the chair of the NACC committee, Senator White. Setting up a new committee in a space such as this is not necessarily the easiest process, and there are always matters that need to be ironed out until committees—to use a very poor sporting analogy—find their line and length, particularly when you are in a quite unique relationship, as Senator White pointed out, with a member of the executive—in this case, the Attorney-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of committees in this place, but the one that I am closest to, as the chair, is the Privileges Committee. It is so important that these committees act in a collegiate fashion and, more than that, in a nonpartisan fashion. Matters such as privilege, such as the operations and oversight of the Anti-Corruption Commission, will fail if they become partisan playthings. It's very important that such committees operate in a collegiate manner. There were some matters that we discussed internally. I won't talk about what they were; they were more matters of process, and they certainly had nothing to do with the appropriateness of the candidates. But there were some issues that needed to be considered by the committee. That was done in a very timely way, and I think, in the end, we have reached a very positive position, and I think the committee has shown it can work very well together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Senator White, I thank all those who put their names forward for positions on the National Anti-Corruption Commission. These roles are going to be vitally important going forward, and they have a huge challenge ahead of them. We thank all those who put their names forward and congratulate those who have been appointed today.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SHOEBRIDGE:</span>
                    </a>  First of all, I thank and commend the chair and the members of the committee for the process we undertook over the last two-and-a-bit weeks. I particularly want to note the leadership of the chair, who, I think, brought the committee to what was ultimately a consensus position to confirm all the appointees to these four important positions in the National Anti-Corruption Commission. It was essential that we had this as a consensus position, because we need to ensure that the NACC is established and starts with as broad political support and consensus as we can have. It's a credit to the committee—at least the other members of the committee, as well as the chair—that we eventually arrived at a consensus position, and that reflects the quality of the candidates who were put forward before the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as has been touched upon in an earlier contribution, there are lessons to be learned from the process we went through. The committee required an extension of time to enable it to get appropriate information. At times I don't think I was the only member of the committee who was frustrated about the timeliness of the information and the provision of the necessary information for us to do our statutory task, under section 178. But I would note that, from my observation, each member of the committee, regardless of where their politics lies—government, opposition, crossbench—understood we had an important obligation to fulfil under section 178 of the act. I think we worked through those issues together in a collegiate manner to get the information we needed to exercise that function and scrutinise the appointments. But I do want to stress that I think there are lessons to be learnt. I think a mutual respect between the executive and the parliament, when these statutory functions cross between the executive and the parliament, is necessary. At times, I felt that relationship was a little strained in the exercise of the committee's powers and its roles and functions. I hope those lessons have been learnt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Again, I think the chair helped map the pathway to that over the course of two and a bit weeks. I hope that this is an indication that when the NACC opens its doors it has, I hope, unanimous or near unanimous support for its functions, its roles and for the officers who undertake those important functions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the government amendments to the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2023.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is imperative that this chamber focuses in on its role, which is a role to scrutinise the government, its legislation and the dirty, dodgy deals it does with its bedfellows, the Australian Greens. We were promised scrutiny. We were promised transparency. Indeed it was something that the Australian Greens also promised and always talk about—integrity and conduct when it comes to legislating on behalf of the people of Australia, the people that send us here to do our jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, though, we are being denied the opportunity to closely examine amendments to a bill, a hallmark piece of legislation that this government has been talking about and singing from the rafters about. They've been telling everyone it's going to fix every problem every Australian household and business faces when it comes to the cost of energy and when it comes to carbon emissions. But during the debate that we've had over the period of time since the bill was tabled and introduced in the other place, our friends here in the Greens have been cooking up a secret deal with the Australian Labor Party, the government, to make this bill worse in the name of just getting the bill through this week. It's going to drive up power prices. It's going to offshore emissions. It's going to ensure that people are without jobs. This crew here, the Labor-Greens government, the people that run this brave new world of accountability and transparency—I say that with my tongue firmly implanted in my cheek—don't want us to know about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We got the amendments this morning, just before the debate in the committee stage of the bill commenced. That's outrageous. What contempt for the role of this chamber and the people that occupy it. Why can't we see in detail these amendments and what they mean? Why can't we go out and speak to the business community before we are forced to vote on this bill at the end of this week? Why can't we go out and talk to the environmental groups about what it means? For instance, the Bob Brown Foundation might have a strong view on this. I'd be interested to know what they have to say about this particular set of amendments that were cooked up in a smoke filled room somewhere in the bowels of this building between two parties of government, the Labor Party and the Greens. Why won't you let us do this? I would love to delay this bill to enable such scrutiny to occur because I think it's the very least we owe the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, of course, in response to a government that went to the election promising that they were going to reduce power bills for all of you by $275. That was a promise made 97 times. Despite our best efforts, not a single person on the frontbench, nor any of the backbenchers, will utter that number, because it's a promise they knew they couldn't keep and it's a promise they know this legislation that we are dealing with in this chamber at the moment and these secret, dodgy, dirty amendments that have been made to this bill will not help achieve. They knew they were going to con the Australian people at the election. They knew they weren't going to be able to deliver on this promise. They gave everyone false hope when it came to ensuring they could meet their cost-of-living pressures, balance their own household budgets, keep the heaters and lights on during winter, put food on the table and ensure that the economy could continue to function and businesses could remain competitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, they've gone and cooked up this dodgy deal—amendments that have been talked about; the minister, in the committee stage on this legislation said, 'We announced the amendments on 27 March, but we're only going to give them to you today as debate in the committee stage is commencing.' I've only just been able to read the supplementary explanatory memorandum. I think it is outrageous that this government would be so arrogant to think: 'Well, do you know what? Stuff you all. You don't need to understand a single thing in the amendments. You don't need to understand the EM. You don't need to know what this means for the people you represent, because they don't deserve it. We're in government. We will rule, and we will tell you what will get through this place, because we've got the numbers with the Greens.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what happens, and I should know, as should any Tasmanian senator here. When Labor and the Greens get together, this is what they do. They cook up deals—bad deals—and they send the economy backwards. That will generate bad environmental outcomes, too. This is why people like former senator Bob Brown have been so outspoken about this legislation, and people have been tweeting about how bad it is. So, I say: please, have a shred of decency, Australian Labor Party. Perhaps the Greens will side with us and we can send these amendments off to a committee for examination. Perhaps we can have some transparency, some integrity in this process. Perhaps we could make you guys deliver on the promise you made 97 times to the Australian people ahead of the election. It's what you owe them, and you should deliver on it.</span>

But the reality is that the position of those opposite is still the same. At the end of the day, the reason they are opposed to the safeguard mechanism legislation and are using every trick in the book to try to delay and obfuscate is that they do not believe in taking action on climate change. That's the fundamental principle from those opposite. They do not actually want to pass this legislation, and that is why Senator Duniam is looking for every delaying tactic in the book.</span>

So, it is stunt after stunt, filibuster after filibuster, because, at the end of the day, they have learnt nothing from the election last year. They've taken no lessons from that. They've taken no lessons about taking action on climate change, because they are so divided in their own show. We saw the federal election result last year. We saw the New South Wales election result only a couple of days ago, where the Liberal government was defeated. But they still come into this chamber and want to use every delaying tactic they can, every trick in the book, because, at the end of the day, they do not want to see serious action taken on climate change. That is what we took to the election. That is what we intend on delivering in government. People are sick and tired of the games of those opposite. We will not stand for it. I move:</span>

                    </a>  I want to remind all senators that yesterday there were many conversations about the Voice to Parliament. For many First Nations people in this country under 40, this will be the first time they vote in a referendum, and this motion jeopardises the success of this referendum. It undermines the currency of the conversation that we're about to have. These cooked-up terms of reference are being used to overshadow what is the national conversation happening at the moment, using our public funding and Senate resources and procedures, which is not the function of this place. We will not be supporting this vicious attack on our peak organisations and grassroots organisations, and the Greens will be opposing this motion. </span>

                    </a>  The government will be opposing this motion. Disclosure of material of the nature requested by Senator Whish-Wilson would be contrary to Australia's national interests, including for the reasons that it may be prejudicial to the security or defence of the Commonwealth and could prejudice international relations. The nuclear reactors that power submarines are a proven and safe technology. The science and technologies associated with them are highly specialised capabilities that will support classified national security activities across government. Over more than 60 years, the United Kingdom and the United States have operated more than 500 naval nuclear reactors without a single radiological incident. A sophisticated security and safety architecture will surround Australia's nuclear powered submarine program. Australia is unwavering in its commitment to safely and securely stewarding its nuclear powered submarines.</span>

This is clearly one of the 30 pieces of silver that the Australian Greens are getting for supporting the ridiculous safeguard mechanism legislation, a stitch-up deal for getting up an inquiry up that they would otherwise oppose. This just further demonstrates exactly what's going on in the dark rooms with darkened windows, filled with smoke, where the Greens and Labor stitch up deals to set up committees like this one. I find it outrageous. We will let it go through, but it's another example of what happens in this brave new world of Labor-Green government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In an article in the South Chinese Morning Post, it was reported that Chinese Central Bank data showed that not only have 4.6 million merchant outlets accepted CBDC payments, but more than 261 million digital wallets have been opened, totaling 83 billion yuan or $12.2 billion US.

Yes, the intent is that net and gross emissions are reduced. So the government, as you know, has legislated our 2030 targets, and these amendments in this bill before us now apply a proportionate share of those targets to the safeguard sector. This is a budget of 1,233 million tons of emissions from 30 June 2020 to 30 June 2030 and a single year amount of 100 megatons in 2030. These are net targets, which include the use of offsets.</span>

Our understanding of that paragraph, and that's what I am seeking your clarity on, Minister, is that making clear that the thresholds for facilities to be covered by the scheme from 100,000 tonnes shouldn't be raised artificially to remove facilities from the scheme rather than changes to baselines or offsetting to reduce a facility's emissions. Is that correct, and can you provide an explanation of the intent of that paragraph?</span>

What we're saying here is that any attempt to adjust coverage thresholds in the legislative rules for the scheme to show a reduction in total emissions from all covered facilities would not be consistent with the object of the act. The object is to reduce emissions from these facilities. It is not to exclude facilities by rule changes when those emissions would still occur in Australia and contribute to our national targets. So any rules that were made for such an improper purpose would not be consistent with the rulemaking test to be implied under the bill.</span>

I am grateful our interpretation is correct. The proposed section 22XS(1D)(c) states that the information provided to the secretary by an agency or authority of the Commonwealth or a state or territory also needs to be considered. Can I confirm what agencies that will include. Would it include, for example, state based environmental protection agencies, NOPSEMA or Infrastructure Australia? </span>

We will consult by mid-2023 on guidelines for how international best-practice values will be set and then consult on the setting of specific factors during the second half of 2023, with the aim of having best-practice values set by the end of 2023. The guidelines will apply to all values and we will work with stakeholders to ensure that we've prioritised necessary values. This will include considering the likely entry of new facilities across safeguard sectors to ensure all values are in place for the required 2023-24 compliance year.</span>

The government, as you know, is committed to implementing recommendation 8 of the Independent Review of Australian Carbon Credit Units in full. That would be done by the Clean Energy Regulator, consistent with the review's recommendation that the CER should continue to be responsible for project monitoring, compliance and enforcement.</span>

Professor Chubb also noted in that statement that the CER can, and does, use existing provisions to address project noncompliance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will direct the Clean Energy Regulator not to issue future credits to human induced regeneration projects until the regulator is satisfied that the project complies with recommendation 8 of the review. The government will also direct the regulator to prioritise the integrity of these projects by appointing independent auditors in relation to human induced regeneration project gateway reviews. That would be under section 215 of the existing act. These checks would ensure that vegetation in the project area is growing as expected and as required by the method and the Carbon Farming Initiative, or CFI, rule.</span>

It's anticipated that that compliance check we've been referring to in this most recent of exchanges would occur at that point in time. It's a little dependent, therefore, on the way those project proponents come forward and approach the CER.</span>

It provides, I think, helpful guidance about the interpretation of the method and what would be required. It also indicates that the CER should, as soon as feasible, include nominated suppression mechanisms and eligible HIR activities for new and existing projects on the project register. We are confident that the CER is in a position to implement the recommendation and we expect them to do so. </span>

It will provide dedicated funding for projects that reduce emissions at facilities that are trade exposed. It will support projects that reduce emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism, i.e. the eligible facility scope 1 emissions. It's intended to be technology and project neutral. It could support a range of project types like energy efficiency upgrades, shifts to lower carbon processes or fuel switching. Funding through this stream would reduce the capital costs for safeguard facilities to invest in new low-emission technologies and then fast track their adoption. By reducing safeguard facilities covered emissions it can reduce the ongoing cost for trade exposed facilities to meet their falling baselines. </span>

Something like 17 Hunter Valley coalmines are scheduled to close in the next decade, but it's anticipated that the vast majority of them will seek extensions of time but possibly at lower rates of production. Most extensions are controlled actions under the EPBC Act when it's an expansion, but my question pertains to extensions in time. Given that they're extensions in time rather than in scope, and given that they're likely to have lower scope 1 emissions than the 100,000 trigger—even though emissions from the whole project will still be over the trigger—I want to know how those coalmine time extensions will be treated by the pollution trigger under the safeguard mechanism.</span>

If it is already a safeguard facility and an additional action which is likely to result in increased scope 1 emissions is approved under the EPBC Act, the minister responsible for the EPBC Act will notify the minister for climate change, the climate change secretary and the Climate Change Authority of the nature of this change and the quantum relating to the action. That would then allow each of those people or bodies to carry out their functions in relation to compliance with the emissions requirements and the objects of the act.</span>

Thank you; I understand that process. But I'm interested in what will happen when the scenario is an extension of time of an existing facility which would emit scope 1 emissions below the threshold, despite applying to a project that is cumulatively above the threshold and ergo is covered by the safeguard mechanism. I don't know how the EPBC Act would treat that, because it's not an expansion in scope; it's an extension of time with a reduced production output. So I'm interested in how those extensions would be treated by the hard cap and by the pollution trigger in the safeguard mechanism.</span>

I think that, in the circumstances described in your question, it would be quite dependent on the Minister for the Environment at the time. I'm happy to seek further information for you, but it's quite a specific circumstance, and I'll have to make inquiries.</span>

Obviously, I remain interested in understanding exactly what level of work and in-depth analysis and modelling has occurred, because, as the minister said, a lot of work went into developing these policies and these laws post election, so it would be horrible to see this whole thing derailed by something that hasn't been analysed properly or thoroughly.</span>

I think there is an underlying premise in your question: that the amendments before the chamber today substantially depart from the model that was presented earlier. In truth, as we've been very clear about in our public commentary on the process we were going through, we have been willing to take helpful suggestions that strengthen the policy intent and the implementation arrangements for the proposal we took forward. We think that the additional reforms that are before us today in the form of amendments are sensible. They provide arrangements in relation to transparency and certainty in the operation of the mechanism. But the fundamental analysis is as I have already described it to you. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was, as has been discussed at estimates and in the committee process for this bill, some modelling work that was undertaken around opportunities for onsite abatement on facilities. There has also been very broad consultation over a very long period of time with a very broad range of people. I do note that a broad coalition of business leaders and groups support the reforms, principally because they provide policy and investment certainty for large emitters. It's also the case, and it has been widely noted, that around 170 facilities already covered by the safeguard mechanism are already covered by net zero commitments that they have made in response to other drivers in their businesses. That represents 86 per cent of scheme emissions, and a third of the publicly listed companies that are in safeguard facilities use an internal carbon price for investment decisions, with half using a price of more than $100 a tonne. These things are already part of business decision-making, and the feedback that we have has been overwhelmingly supportive of the approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In part that is because the proposed reforms have been designed to provide sufficient flexibility to moderate and mitigate any cost impact. I point to three features of the scheme: the hybrid approach to setting baselines moderates the initial scheme impact while encouraging production to occur where it's less emissions intensive, which lowers the overall economywide cost; there are flexible compliance options, including borrowing, multi-year monitoring and the use of domestic offsets which will help safeguard facilities meet their obligations at a lower cost; and, as we have just been discussing in relation to the Powering the Regions Fund, assistance will be available to ensure businesses are not competitively disadvantaged. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make this final point: there are costs that arise from inaction, and so, without a credible domestic policy to reduce industrial emissions, Australia's exports may increasingly be subject to import tariffs or to carbon border adjustments imposed by our trade partners. As I think former Treasurer Frydenberg said rather publicly, Australian businesses may also face increased capital costs in an environment where global financial institutions and decision-makers are taking coordinated steps to align investment with the transition to net zero. </span>

If we are to take the government at their word, it's changing the landscape and providing certainty et cetera. To that end, beyond what had been done for the existing legislation—the consultation and analysis that you referred to—surely the government has sought to understand what impact the changes, be they large or small, will have on business so that they can provide that certainty. We received the amendments this morning with the supplementary explanatory memorandum, so, on that basis, to satisfy myself that what you're saying, that it will be all okay, is correct, I would be interested in knowing what modelling has happened. You referred to the cost of not doing anything. Has there been any analysis or quantification of those costs with regard to sea bans or other important tariffs? Do you have any examples of the costs that might be imposed on any particular industry that you could enlighten us with? </span>

There has been some modelling undertaken internally between the department and the Treasury. There has been a design process which has sought to provide flexibility to mitigate the cost impacts. There has been wide consultation to properly understand businesses' circumstances and the way that the proposal would interact with existing businesses covered by the mechanism. As I've indicated, there are potential costs of inaction, and they were alluded to by a former Treasurer in a government that you were part of. If I have any specific information about that I will provide that to you. But I think it is certainly the case that there is a global move towards investors making quite substantial requirements in relation to decarbonisation, and Australian businesses are not immune from that.</span>

What you did step us through was all of the work to the completion of the bill as it was presented, prior to any changes, and I appreciate that. I've talked about the fact that that appears to be a very in-depth and thorough process. What I was asking about was everything from that point in time to the end product, such as the changes we have here that have been asked about by the Greens. I think you're telling me that, as its the government's opinion that they're not significant departures from what was there, there has been no modelling undertaken. You said there was no capacity to provide information borne out of modelling or analysis around costs to businesses relating to any of the changes to the bill that have brought forward through these negotiations. I'd be interested to have that compare and contrast with the cost of inaction. You referred to former treasurer Frydenberg's contribution to the public debate on this. What are those figures? It should be a like-for-like thing, particularly with the various international agreements we are reaching, the trade arrangements. There must be some capacity for you to step us through what the cost of not doing something is, compared to doing what this bill proposes to do.</span>

We still don't know what modelling has been done, by who, on what. Any question we ask, such as: has Treasury done modelling on what the impact is going to be on GDP? Has Treasury done impact on what job losses may occur? Has any modelling been done by anyone—DCCEEW and Treasury? All have said, 'No.' So we've been told what modelling hasn't been done, but I'm trying to understand what modelling has been done, because we have not been told anything in the affirmative, only who hasn't done what. </span>

In a moment, I'll come to some of the comments of some of the groups out there that are expressing fear about this. I'm interested in this issue of modelling around analysis for demand for ACCUs. While we're thinking about that, I'd also be interested in how the carbon price being set here in this legislation compares to the carbon price that Australia's trading partners have as well as the carbon price in other developed nations. </span>

On that, we might look to explain the difference between the price outlined in the Powering Australia policy document and where the government has landed with what is proposed here. </span>

Essentially, the penalty is a penalty that would be paid for noncompliance. We expect that most businesses will want to comply. The cost containment measure is a far more likely pathway for a business that is seeking to avail itself of ACCUs for compliance than the penalty; however, it is important that a penalty for noncompliance exists. I will note, however, that the safeguard mechanism so far has had 100 per cent compliance.</span>

It's not so much that it's linked to but how it compares with the existing arrangements. Essentially, the bill updates the arrangements for a civil penalty that a facility would incur if its net emissions were higher than permitted. That would be described as an excess emissions situation. As you'd understand, excess emissions could impact our climate outcomes, so the penalty should be proportional both to the length of delay in meeting the requirements and, importantly, the quantity of excess emissions. Previously, the penalty for an excess emissions situation depended only on the duration, not on the relevant quantity.</span>

The maximum civil penalty will be set at one penalty unit per tonne of excess emissions every year. I am trying to seek information—staff very helpfully point out that this is set out in the EM, which says it:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">differs to the existing penalty that is set in the NGER Regulations, which for a non-individual is 100 penalty units for each day in an excess emissions situation, up to a maximum of 10,000 penalty units. For an individual, the existing penalty is 20 per cent of this amount—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">noting that no covered facilities are individuals. There needs to be a degree of proportionality between the seriousness of the contravention and the quantum of the penalty; I've explained that. The EM says:</span>

Obviously I agree with you that no businesses want to continue to be in the situation where they are exposed to such a liability, with the penalty being $275 per tonne per year. If they can't access ACCUs in the ordinary way, you're saying there is a facility available through the cost containment measure through the government's ACCUs—if I understand correctly—and on that basis no business will ever face the penalty. Is that right?</span>

We talked about wilful noncompliance with the baseline. My simple understanding of this is that the business is in breach because it can't meet the baseline—the 4.9 per cent per year through to 2030—and it can't access offsets because the market may not have them available. The new piece of information to my mind is that the government is going to make available capacity to cover any business that can't find them elsewhere, which to my mind says that there will be no-one paying the penalty unless, as you said, they are wilfully in breach, which talks to almost some sort of criminal mental intent. If you could just explain that, I'd be grateful.</span>

Ultimately a decision about whether to find a business in breach would be a decision for the regulator, and they would step through a series of processes. However, to date compliance with the safeguard mechanism has been 100 per cent. It's not our expectation that covered facilities or covered entities wish to do anything else but comply. All of the design features of the scheme were designed with close consultation with the regulated community to create circumstances where they can comply, and the cost containment measure is part of that, as are the borrowing arrangements that would allow an entity to borrow some of their future entitlements within a five-year period and also the trading arrangements that would allow them to purchase safeguard credits from other participants in the safeguard mechanism.</span>

Obviously, there's a framework for decision-making for the regulator to view these matters through, and they step through a decision-making process. You're telling me that, if you're in breach and you can't get your offsets, one way or the other, you don't automatically get a penalty. That is an important difference. I wasn't aware of that. Are you projecting no revenue based purely on historical experience or because you believe the framework for decision-making will ameliorate the need to impose penalties in the future?</span>

In terms of the industries and sectors that are hard to abate, is there a prescribed list or is there some sort of methodology that sets out a threshold by which they can be included as hard to abate? I'm interested in who is included in the concessions and carve-outs.</span>

The scheme contemplates trade exposed entities that are baseline adjusted. Whether or not an entity qualifies for that second category is dependent on the cost of compliance and what proportion of business revenue—or EBIT for manufacturing businesses—it is. The second pathway was the change to the proposed rules that was announced on Monday as a consequence of the consultation with industry that has been going on for many months.</span>

It's that category that will allow those entities to have access to the differentiated test for whether or not they should be eligible for an adjustment to their baseline.</span>

Is the end result, the adjusted baseline, subjective? Is it going to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, or once you meet this test you then get an adjusted baseline which is X per cent as opposed to 4.9 per cent?</span>

Trade exposed baseline adjusted—perhaps I can take you through all of it. It is the subset of trade exposed facilities that can demonstrate that their costs are above a specified threshold. Facilities will have a different framework depending on whether the facility is manufacturing or non-manufacturing, which is why I made reference to the need to make such a determination in the rule. That differential treatment between manufacturing and non-manufacturing reflects stakeholder feedback on the differences between the two in terms of their margins and their capital intensity. For non-manufacturing, the proposed threshold will be based on scheme cost as a percentage of facility revenue. As a I indicated for manufacturing, the proposed threshold will be based on scheme cost as a percentage of facility EBIT. That simply reflects the differences in the way that these businesses are organised. Either way, trade exposed baseline adjusted facilities can apply for a lower baseline decline rate. The policy rationale for that is that these facilities face concentrated impacts under the scheme and present a genuine risk of carbon leakage. So the minimum baseline reduction for non-manufacturing activities will be two per cent, and it will be one per cent for manufacturing. That baseline would be locked in for three years.</span>

At what point in time in that three-year cycle do they then engage in a reassessment, for certainty's sake, about what comes after the end of that three-year period on the rate? </span>

Yes, it is a sliding scale which operates between the standardised expectation of reductions of 4.9 per cent and the minimum of either two or one depending on the category and entity that we're talking about. You asked about the means by which that baseline would be established. Each year the facility would apply, so it would have a forward baseline established for the forward three years, but that would be reassessed the following year, if they wish to.</span>

You've just mentioned that ammonium nitrate is now a carve-out. My understanding is, taking some time so there can be conversation, that Orica may have been in discussions with the government and received some sort of carve-out on the understanding that with some grandfathered contracts to 2029 there may be a carve-out in this form, or some other legislation or delegated legislation to come. Could you tell me how that might come about, what form that is in, and how we could give certainty for that investment decision into Gladstone if that is the case? </span>

I was aware of your interest in Orica. My understanding is that the government has been in discussions with Orica about their particular circumstances and, having reviewed the contractual arrangements that are in place for them, has indicated that it will be possible to grandfather that arrangement due to the existing contractual circumstances and their arrangements with the government.</span>

Firstly, could you indicate how the quantum of $400 million was arrived at, and also in the case of the $600 million for the safeguard transformation stream? </span>

The government is very firm in its commitment to establish arrangements to support manufacturing and industrial activity. The safeguard mechanism is part of that. It is about providing the certainty that is necessary for those businesses to make the necessary investments to remain competitive in a world that is decarbonising. The National Reconstruction Fund is part of that. It is about providing resources to ensure that we continue to be a country that makes things—and, frankly, makes more things than we do at the moment. The Powering the Regions Fund, more broadly, is designed to provide support for the transition, and notwithstanding the specific allocations for safeguard facilities, safeguard facilities will also be eligible to apply for the other resources in the Powering the Regions Fund.</span>

If you do your maths, they're indicating that $1 in every $10 required to be spent on the transition is going to be a significant impost on business to be able to make the transition. I wonder whether that sort of feedback, as part of this very broad consultation which has taken in the views of stakeholders, was considered as part of what government looked at as it moved into setting up these funds? If you could indicate to me whether that impost on business—$9 out of every $10 coming from a business to be able to transition, as opposed to $1 out of every $10 being the support from government to get to where the government and the world want them to be—has been factored in and, indeed, whether there is any assurance that a lack of support isn't going to result in a reduction in investment, a loss of jobs, the passing on of costs to consumers. Those sorts of things are what we're concerned about here, and based on the feedback of one significant employer, one significant contributor to our economy, it sounds like there are going to be some big costs.</span>

I do note that Rio Tinto, prior to any obligation imposed by the safeguard mechanism, have their own commitment to net zero by 2050, and that's a commitment that they've made to their shareholders and investors. More broadly, can I just bring a sense of reality to this debate. We have gone through 10 years where the business environment for many of these businesses was terribly uncertain as a consequence of your government's—the previous government's—inability to land a climate policy or an energy policy. I well remember the many Senate inquiries that I attended when these same businesses came before us and said that what they desperately wanted was certainty and that was the thing that would unlock the investment that you're speaking about.

That's why I'm very concerned about the parallel universe in which this deal was struck up, which is why I've been asking these questions. And while I appreciate the gratuitous political points being made about the last 10 years, this is about looking forward. You won the last election. I find myself on this side of the chamber asking questions of the government about their policy—what it's going to do and how much it will drive up power prices. I can run through the record of power prices in the last term if you want, but that actually doesn't assist us in understanding what this legislation is going to do.</span>

I would be interested to get a sense of how entities would be able to access support through these funds. What sort of process? Who do they speak to? What sort of application form? What thresholds? Any data of that nature would be helpful. And then perhaps I might look to Senator Waters down there. I'm sure she has questions, and I can come back to this.</span>

I provided answers to these same questions to Senator Waters when she asked me earlier about arrangements for accessing the fund. The short story is that the funds are being established in the context of the forthcoming budget, and the rules and the approach to grants, including the entity that would be responsible for distributing any funds, are under development.</span>

I know you said that the delivery mechanism for the Powering the Regions Fund will be decided through the budget process. I accept that. My question is whether you've had any feedback from industry or regulators—or from any quarter, really—that the grants hub for hydrogen hubs and modern manufacturing initiative programs are substandard vehicles for getting projects up and running and whether that's therefore factoring into your decision-making when you decide on the delivery mechanism for the Powering the Regions Fund.</span>

Sometimes a grants hub is a suitable way of doing it, and you will be aware that the grants hubs across the Commonwealth administer quite a wide range of projects. In this particular case we are simply working through the best arrangements to distribute the resources in the most effective way, given the particular policy task before us.</span>

Essentially, it's whether or not the increased emissions will be treated as within the safeguard mechanism or below the coverage. I just want to know how that will be treated.</span>

It is this: if in a financial year the environment minister approves the taking of an action for the purpose of a controlling provision within the meaning of the act; and the environment minister is satisfied that the action is likely to result in an increase in the financial year or future financial years of scope 1 emissions of greenhouse gases from the operation of a designated large facility for the financial year or a new designated large facility for the financial year or a future financial year; and the environment minister has been given an estimate of the scope 1 emissions of greenhouse gases from the taking of the action in one or more financial years, they must give that estimate to the minister, the climate change secretary and the Climate Change Authority as soon as practicable. It's the passing on of that information that then triggers a consideration by the minister, or indeed any of those entities—the minister, the Climate Change Authority or the secretary—of whether any additional action is required.</span>

I think I understand that. I ask one follow-up question to make sure that I'm following you. If the test in the EPBC Act, which you just quoted from, was an increase in scope 1 emissions—it doesn't have to be a significant increase; it's just any increase. Ergo, in my scenario, where I put to you that the time frame for the operating coalmine would be extended and therefore there would be an increase in emissions but it wouldn't itself be above the 100,000 trigger, I interpret what you've just read out as saying that that increase would therefore trigger the need for the environment minister to pass on the number of those projected scope 1 emissions, which will then be treated in the fashion that you've taken us through—namely, it will be checked against the hard cap.</span>

However, yes, in the main, if this is a covered facility, no matter the scale of the increase, it would engage an obligation to make such a notification. I just make a clarification. I may have misheard this, but just for clarity: the obligation that we're discussing would sit within the Climate Change Act not within the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.</span>

Then there's this basic principle around supply and demand, the economics of supply and demand, and when you don't have enough supply you can't meet demand. We need these inputs to be able to generate energy, given the way our energy mix is generated at the moment. </span>

We only have to look at the ACCC and AEMO, who tell us the best way and only way to deal with some of these cost pressures we're facing with electricity today, tomorrow and into the future is by bringing on supply. The Greens tell us that supply is not going to be met, that we're killing it off and it's not going to be a part of what happens here, as a part of the arrangements reached under this legislation. </span>

I just wonder whether, as part of the broad-ranging consultations that have occurred that you've talked about, whether this sort of thing, with the stakeholders, the NFF or the Queensland equivalent et cetera, might have reached into the consultation process and indicated that the facilities that Incitec Pivot owns, what sort of an impact any changes to the arrangements they operate under would have on the farmers.

Some facilities that have a lower emissions-intensive production might receive safeguard mechanism credits. They would be able to sell those to other safeguard facilities. As we have already canvassed at length, trade tailored assessment is available for trade exposed facilities. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the agricultural sector it is perhaps worth noting that the safeguard reforms will result in increased demand for ACCUs, incentivising abatement in the land sector and allowing landowners and farmers to generate another source of income.</span>

I don't want you to try and guess what businesses are doing. I guess I am using this company as an example. Incitec Pivot has a number of entities in Queensland that will be affected by the changes here. There will be an increase in the cost of what they do. The IMF actually found that a one per cent rise in fertiliser prices increases food commodity prices by 0.45 per cent . Minister, can you indicate whether the government accepts that there's a close correlation between, for example, fertiliser price increases and how much Australians pay for their groceries and, to that end, if there is an increase in the cost of doing business for Incitec Pivot, for them to produce the product that farmers rely on, that that would then be passed on to the consumer? Is that something that has been contemplated and potentially concerns the government? </span>

Indeed, in the October budget fruit and vegetable prices were estimated to be eight per cent higher than what they would otherwise have been. It was a consequence of the flooding events at the time. The truth is that climate change is resulting in increased frequency and severity of severe weather events—drought, flooding, fire and storms. These events do disrupt supply chains, impact productivity and increase insurance costs for business and consumers. I raise this because it's an example of the mistaken analysis of looking at only one variable in the costs that are affecting Australian consumers. We are going through a period of change in what's expected from the investment community, in our global market, in our global supply chains and, frankly, in the operating environment, particularly for Australian farmers. We understand and major agricultural producers understand that the transition towards net zero is extremely important because it impacts, more than most sectors, the ongoing capacity of the agricultural sector to produce food and fibre.</span>

Of course, in addition to those increased costs relating to fruit and vegetables that you mentioned, Minister, the ABS indicated that the cost of bread and cereal products has increased by 12.2 per cent over the last year, the cost of meat and seafood has increased by 8.2 per cent and the cost of dairy and related products has increased by 14.9 per cent. So it's across the board, and I accept that there are variables and many inputs. But, just because there are other impacts on the price, including climate induced flooding or drought, that doesn't mean we should then up the price or put pressures on industry elsewhere. I'm going to move off the farming component now, and I might go to some broader questions around facilities, if I may. Of the 215 facilities captured under the mechanism, how many had existing plans to reduce their emissions by 30 per cent by 2030?</span>

As we talked about in this chamber on many occasions, that is because it is the single most significant thing that Australia can do to catalyse the necessary global action that we need to tackle dangerous climate change. We have been through, this afternoon and this morning, the extensive consultation process that has been undertaken, talking with all of these facilities. We examined, in many instances, what businesses were keen to discuss with the department about their plans and their thinking. There is a wealth of information in the public domain. In fact, I was recently, just now, pointed to Incitec Pivot's <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate </span><span style="font-style:italic;">change report</span>, which talks about their commitment to reducing emissions and the four projects that they are undertaking in Australia and internationally as they seek to deliver material change in their operational emissions. They said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mean, business is doing this. And as we've canvassed in a range of different ways over the course of the debate, they are doing so as a consequence of a range of forces, including the investor community.</span>

I will give it one more go, which is to say that it is undoubtedly the case that the government has engaged deeply and over an extended period of time with the regulated community in relation to this reform. We have talked about the many activities that took place—the round tables, the public consultation, the written consultation, the targeted meetings—because the government does seek to deeply understand the plans and commitments of the businesses that are engaged in the safeguard mechanism. That involved talking to them about their plans. Did the department gather exactly the data you are requesting? Perhaps no. But I don't think you can deny that there has been deep and sustained engagement over a long period of time with the covered businesses.</span>

You made a point there about deeply understanding the businesses. I would have thought, where the businesses had plans that mirrored or matched something similar to what the government was intending to do, that it would be something government might have done. But you've said you've answered. You've told me you don't have that data, or the government perhaps does not have that data. I was just provided with the information that Incitec Pivot said they'd reduce by 25 per cent by 2030. So, that's handy to know.</span>

I just wanted to pause, because your characterisation of the arrangements was not quite accurate, and I thought it best to give you very specific information. New gas fields supplying existing liquefied natural gas facilities will be treated as new facilities, regardless of their ownership structure. On that basis, they will be given international best practice baselines for the carbon dioxide in their new fields. For these fields' reservoir CO2 emissions, best practice is a zero, given the existence of low-CO2 fields and opportunities for carbon capture and storage.</span>

I just want to know whether the financial data that was used to model the impact of the safeguard mechanism on individual safeguard facilities was information relating to the facilities, or whether it was information relating to the corporate entities that owned the facilities.</span>

We have sought the information. Even offering a private briefing on the way through might have been handy. But it's been put to me that the information used to underpin the modelling was corporate data rather than being reported by facility. I would appreciate it if you could confirm otherwise, but to my mind that might skew the data that underpins the modelling. It's hard to pursue this properly, because we are operating without access to the information. You've explained why, and I'm not going to ask you to table it or go into detail on it. But if an assurance can't be provided that that information, as I've just characterised it, wouldn't result in a skewed outcome—that is, that it is facility as opposed to corporate, which is what I'm told would be a better arrangement—then I think we have some concerns. So I just wonder if you can provide that assurance that the information provided—the financial data—was by facility. I don't want to know what it said or have it tabled; I just want to know that it was by facility, as opposed to a corporate-level piece of information.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been a senator in this place for a short time, but, like all senators, I am conscious of history, and one thing that seems very clear to me is that this parliament will be judged on the way that it approaches climate change. We know that there is no time to waste, not just because the scientists are urging us and warning us, as we saw in the recent IPCC report, but because we are starting to live with the impacts. We are seeing the impacts across the country. Our farmers are feeling the impacts. Their profits are down 20 per cent since the year 2000 due to climate change. This is here. This is 1.1 degrees of warming that we're living with, and the consequences of moving beyond 1.5 degrees of warming are stark. We know that there are tipping points for cascading climate breakdown, and failure to take action is morally irresponsible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, as a parliament, we are taking a significant step in the right direction. But, to be clear: the reform is far from perfect. We're a long way away from the ideal climate policy in Australia. Economists, including the Productivity Commission, tell us the most efficient way to encourage climate action is to put an economy wide price on carbon, as many other countries have done. This mechanism only covers the 215 heaviest emitters, as we have heard. We must ensure that we keep that in mind because it is very clear that this mechanism is not in line with the goal of 1.5 degrees of warming. It's a start, but our ambition is not enough. Furthermore, the whole mechanism is built on offsets, which we know should only be used as a last resort. In this policy, they're available without restriction. As has been noted, the only other country which allows unrestricted offsets is Kazakhstan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But politics is all about compromise and getting things in place. This reform, while far from perfect, is a substantial step in the right direction. The reform will put downward pressure on emissions from the industrial sector, and that alone is the big change. Finally, businesses will have better incentives to invest in new technologies and decarbonise. For too long in this country the business community has been ahead of government on the issue of climate change. The businesses I speak to want to decarbonise to give themselves the edge in a competitive international environment. Many of our major trading partners are moving away from fossil fuels and starting to look for low- or no-carbon products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's up to us here in this place and those in the other to create a regulatory environment that will encourage the success of future industries like green steel and green aluminium. We need to incentivise decarbonisation so the businesses we want to form part of our future are able to decarbonise and remain here in Australia. I welcome the government's commitment to provide an additional $400 million from the Powering the Regions Fund to assist strategic industries like steel, cement and aluminium to decarbonise. But the reality is that the billion-dollar total is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the capital cost of technology transition and decarbonisation. We have seen the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and a similar measure in the EU provide a huge boost for sustainable manufacturing. I call on the government to do more in the upcoming budget to support the businesses and industries that will drive future economic growth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses are not the only ones calling for action on climate. People around the country want us to take a step forward—a step that will result in actual reductions in emissions. They are clearly frustrated with the politics of climate change and want to get on with the job of making our future safe. My sense is that they want to step forward—a step in the right direction, even if it does not go far enough. This policy, despite its flaws, is a significant step in the right direction. Our heaviest emitters will reduce their net emissions by more than 200 million tonnes between now and 2030. Total emissions will come down. New fossil fuel projects will find it more difficult to set up, extract our resources and send them—along with hefty profits—overseas, while they continue to damage our climate, the climate that we share. And on the back of this new green industries will develop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge Minister Bowen and his office for their work on the safeguard mechanism. Throughout discussions and negotiations with the minister there was much we did not agree on, but it was clear where the minister stood, and I thank him for the way he approached our conversations. Ultimately, a point was reached where I'm satisfied that the reform is a substantial step in the right direction, but we need to move a lot faster. This is just a step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to have more ambition as they formulate the many pieces of climate policy we will need to make up for the decades of inaction, so we can protect the people and places we love. There is so much work to do, from fuel efficiency standards to electrification across households and businesses, and the setting of a far more ambitious 2035 emissions reduction target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But before we get to the safeguard mechanism before us, and I believe that this reform can be improved, I plan to move a series of amendments. As I said, to save the Senate's time I will foreshadow them now. Amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 1903 revised circulated in my name improve the way that offsets are used under the reform. Offsets are a very necessary part of this but should be reserved for hard-to-abate industries. They should only be used as a last resort, and this amendment will make sure that is the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (3) on sheet 1903 removes the price cap on ACCUs and limits the risk to taxpayers should the cap be breached. If we're going to have a market mechanism, I don't see a reason to put a ceiling on the price. If you're going to use the market to try and fix this, then it really doesn't make sense to cap it and, in doing so, potentially expose the Commonwealth and taxpayers to a liability should the Commonwealth run out of ACCUs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments on sheet 1915 discount the value of offsets if more than 50 per cent of compliance with baseline is achieved through offsetting. This will drive onsite abatement and bring forward investment in decarbonisation. If we're not going to have a hard cap on ACCUs there is provision in the regulation-making powers for the minister to discount ACCUs, referred to as the four-fifths rule, and I really believe this would be a valuable tool in imposing a carbon mitigation hierarchy which is well-established and acknowledged around the world. It makes sense for Australia to have one of them embedded in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The number of projects associated with human induced regeneration is 371. There is no reason to believe—well, perhaps I'll start with what the commitment is here. We have committed to the Chubb review. The Chubb review's recommendation 8 makes a series of recommendations about how the human induced regeneration method should be interpreted by the CER when it's evaluating projects and evaluating credits to be assigned as a consequence of activities within projects. Our expectation is that the Clean Energy Regulator will adopt that and apply those recommendations as set out by Professor Chubb. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that 371 is the maximum number of projects that may be implicated. But, in truth, we have no reason to think that these projects are not already in compliance, and we expect how this will be implemented is that when they go to the Clean Energy Regulator to seek their credits it would be at that point that the Clean Energy Regulator would seek to implement the recommendations around interpretation of the method suggested by Professor Chubb. </span>

I want to return to the resources sector. I listened carefully when you spoke earlier about not disclosing the detail of the modelling. However, I've had consultation with a number of the 215 emitters who tell me that whilst they have a program to reduce emissions over the medium turn they will not meet the targets by 2030. When they've raised this in consultation with the department, they've been told they will just have to pay the penalty. Has there been modelling done by the department that would provide information on the budgetary impact of that? </span>

What I was asking, Minister, is that resources projects have advised me that they are on a pathway to emissions reduction, net zero, but that the technology that would allow them to convert from diesel to new motors won't be available to them by the 2030 time frame. One of those emitters told me that it would be a $50 million penalty that they expect the safeguard mechanism will cost them. I'm trying to understand, in the extensive consultation that has happened between the department and resource companies, if there is an understanding of the cost impact across the 215 big emitters, given that we have companies that have themselves modelled the costs that they will incur.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safeguard mechanism is deliberately designed to minimise the costs associated with implementation, and it provides flexibility for that reason. We've had a very big debate in recent months around the nature of the government's reforms to the safeguard mechanism, where various people have expressed views about that flexibility. But, for the reasons you describe, there are limitations on the technology available this decade for some of the covered facilities. In addition to that, in some instances the necessary investment to make it a reduction may well be somewhat lumpy. It might be something that you do at a certain point in time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The design of the compliance arrangements allows for borrowing. It allows for banking. It allows for a business that makes a large investment now to reduce its emissions below the baseline that's required of it—in, say, this financial year—to create credits and sell them to another provider. Of course, it allows for the purchase of ACCUs which has been the subject of quite some public discussion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these design features are there to provide flexibility and to allow optimal progression towards net zero whilst maintaining an incentive to get on that journey. Many of the businesses that are covered already have a public commitment to net zero by 2050, and many of them have interim targets as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talked quite a bit about the modelling and analysis that has been undertaken. I would say to you that the most important feature of the policy development around this has been a very extended engagement and consultation process with business. It has run over a very long period of time. It has been supported by a Senate inquiry process. It has been supported by public consultation and the issuing of discussion papers. We have engaged deeply to understand how these impacts might bear on individual businesses and on sectors. We've done our best to strike a balance. Many stakeholders have told us that we've done so. We're providing the certainty that business needs to make necessary investments, but also getting us on the path to meet our commitments to the international community.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  Minister, I won't continue pressing you because my sense is that you're not going to be able to provide me with the number for the 215 companies that have identified that they don't have the technology available before 2030 to meet the emissions reductions that are modelled—the 4.9 per cent each year. Consequently, I think I'm going to have to find another way to identify that information. I have one company that has identified $50 million. If we extrapolate that across the 215, that is going to be a significant impost on those businesses. If the government doesn't know what that number is, I am concerned, because that is going to be money that would otherwise go into jobs, emissions reduction and other investments. I think the gap in the government's understanding of the impact of this tax is a gap that should be understood and appreciated by both the tax department and this department and certainly by the business community more broadly.</span>

For example, the government has picked out cement and aluminium. If they're part of the energy transition, why would iron ore, met coal, copper and nickel—all of which the World Bank says are essential—not have also been included in that list?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  This bill has made it abundantly clear that the Labor Party still functions as the political wing of the coal and gas industry. Labor's first draft of this bill actually allowed carbon pollution to rise and unlimited dodgy offsets to flood the market. It was literally insupportable. It's clear that billion-dollar multinational fossil fuel companies, like Woodside, Santos, Adani, the Minerals Council and Chevron, write the climate policies of both major parties. Coal and gas corporations remain the puppeteers of both Labor and the coalition, and, unfortunately, as we saw from the first draft of this bill, Labor is a very willing puppet. Despite all the promises of the climate election, despite climate scientists, experts and every credible international organisation telling us we need to keep all new coal and gas in the ground as a bare minimum to save our burning planet, Labor is still refusing to deliver a national climate policy that seriously addresses the science and meets the reality of the climate emergency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens negotiated long and hard on this bill because we knew, and we know, that we can't wait another moment for climate action. We know how important it is to take immediate action to keep every single tonne of coal and gas in the ground that we can. That's why we kept going back; that's why we kept fighting. When we look at where we've landed, what does this actually mean for those of us—the millions of Australians—who care about, voted for and demand the climate action that the science is telling us we need? It shows we've got our work cut out for us. It shows we need to break up the weird, toxic marriage between the fossil fuel industry and the Commonwealth government. We need to stop the revolving door of major party donors, who literally switch their seats in this place for seats in the boardrooms of some of the most polluting companies in the world. It's no wonder that climate politics are so cooked, when the chefs are paid and run by the fossil fuel industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is good news. In the face of all of those forces, in the face of decades of climate-action obstruction, and despite Labor continuing to act as the political wing of the fossil fuel industry, the Greens have secured some genuine wins that will make pollution go down in a serious way. Because coal and gas have taken a huge hit with what has been negotiated by the Greens team. I want to give credit to Adam Bandt and his team for taking that hard road, for continuing to go to the negotiating table despite what at many times seemed to be a no from the fossil fuel industry delivered by the Albanese Government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some of the key wins the Greens have secured: a legislated hard cap on emissions, which means that emissions will ratchet down and actual pollution must decrease, not just the offset. That will effectively knock off around half of Labor's 116 coal and gas projects. That's a huge blow to the worst polluting projects and will make a real difference to the climate. And here's a big reason to celebrate: we have derailed the Beetaloo and Barossa gasfields. I pay tribute to those First Nations communities and activists. I pay tribute to Senator Dorinda Cox, who has campaigned long and hard against those projects. We're not done, but the future sure is looking brighter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have secured a pollution trigger, a carbon trigger, which will force the government to assess the climate impact of all new coal and gas projects. A climate trigger has been a key demand of the environment movement for years now, and we've knocked off most of the dodgy list class of assets. Our changes could take about a quarter of future offsets out of circulation. That means companies have to commit to more actual pollution reduction, and the cost of those offsets, the cost of doing nothing, will go up. Crucially, new gasfields will have to be net zero from day one. That means opening up new gas is increasingly not viable financially. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that's not enough. We know that all new coal and gas needs to stay in the ground if we're going to keep this planet liveable and deliver a secure future for our kids and their kids. We have work cut out for us to break up the toxic marriage between the fossil fuel industry and the major parties in this place. The fact we had to fight Labor tooth and nail to secure these wins is more than frustrating, but it also shows what we can win. We don't win that alone here in parliament. We win that because there are millions of Australians behind us demanding this action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fight is not over, but today we take hope from the fact that we have stopped many of the 116 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline from going ahead. We take hope from the fact that carbon pollution for the first time will be compelled to go down. We take hope from the fact that we have derailed the Beetaloo and Barossa gasfields. We can also take heart from the fact that the share price of several large coal and gas corporations took a hit straight off the back of the announcement of what the Greens have achieved. The safeguard mechanism, this bill, which regulates Australia's 215 biggest polluters, will now have a hard cap on emissions thanks to the work of the Greens, meaning real pollution must actually come down and the coal and gas corporations can't just keep paying their way out with dodgy offsets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are big steps towards a future with no coal and gas, but let's be clear, this is the start of an ongoing fight. Every single coal and gas project that gets approved, if any do, every single one will be approved by Labor, because the only thing stopping us implementing policy that meets the science, that keeps all new coal and gas projects in the ground, the only thing that is stopping that is the lack of Labor's ambition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I again give credit to those millions of Australians who voted for more. We are here to continue to deliver more. We will support this bill because we know it's going to make a meaningful difference, but by no means is this the end of the struggle. </span>

I mean, really, we have the Greens standing up in this place, talking proudly about having depressed the share price of great Australian companies like Woodside. I find it shocking that they would stand up in this place and say that. These are people who have just done a deal with the Labor government, a government that they describe as a corrupt ecocidal petrostate. This is the deal that you've done, Senator Shoebridge, and then you stand up in here and you talk about how wonderful it is that you depressed the share price of a great Western Australian company, a company that is in the super funds of hundreds of thousands of Australians, particularly Western Australians, and a company that employs thousands of Western Australians and, with secondary flow-on effects, employs probably tens of thousands. It supplies gas to DomGas of Western Australia, which provides energy and heat for industrial uses right across my home state of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">WA is also the highest domestic gas user in Australia, so it provides heating, it provides gas for stoves and it provides gas for hot water. This is a great Western Australian company. It doesn't deserve to be treated with contempt by this place, by this Labor government in alliance with the Greens. Again, I can't get pass this: Senator McKim described the government they just did a deal with as a 'corrupt ecocidal petrostate'. This is the kind of alliance in government that we have between the Labor Party and the Greens. I do have some substantive questions for the minister, but I will leave it there for now.</span>

I have had concerns raised with me by farmers. Some farmers, who do have carbon projects generating ACCUs, are saying that they would prefer not to have to sell their ACCUs to fossil fuel companies who are making their lives harder and risking their family farming operations. And, earlier today, the National Farmers Federation put out a media release titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Safeguard mechanism needs to be safe for agriculture</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and to quote the CEO, Tony Mahar:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The safeguard mechanism will turbo charge demand for offsets, and with few other options on the table, emitters will look to farmland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Agriculture is a truly hard to abate sector, unlike fossil fuels. We have alternatives for them, particularly new fossil fuel projects—there is no real argument for them. Farmers who wish to offset their own emissions, or 'inset' their emissions, are concerned about competing with fossil fuel companies for offsets, offsets that will most likely come from the land sector. We've seen farmers having to compete with fossil fuel companies for water during drought. They simply don't have the same budgets and the same access to capital. What reassurance can the government give that farmers will not suffer in the long-term as a result of the high offset prices due to huge demand from fossil fuel companies?</span>

The situation you describe is an interesting one, isn't it, because implicit in the way that you ask the question is an acknowledgement that the land sector potentially, in a low-carbon world, is a source of real value. It offers enormous potential to store carbon, and, once a value is attached to that, that's potentially a source of value for landowners and landholders that can provide social, economic and environmental benefits to regional communities and to the landholders themselves. There are co-benefits as well. Soil carbon projects obviously have a carbon benefit, but they also improve soil health and potentially agricultural productivity. We've got lots of people operating in that way now around the country, doing interesting work and I think advocating in really interesting ways for sustainable farming.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But you're right that it's not without tensions, and we ought to pay attention to the way that change impacts on regional communities. This was something that was considered by Professor Chubb in his review, and that review recommended that the government continue to support regional communities to participate in and to benefit from the creation of ACCUs. The government is working on implementing that recommendation. As a first step the government will implement a $20 million carbon farming outreach program. This program will support farmers and other land managers to access independent trusted advice to empower them to make informed decisions about whether and how to participate in carbon markets. This will ensure that farmers can make the decisions that are right for them and right for their businesses. </span>

There were some particular issues that were identified through the course of the consultation, and they have led the government to create a separate stream of funding for the manufacturing sector, as you've described. However, for clarity, all safeguard mechanism participants will be broadly eligible to participate in the Powering the Regions Fund allocations overall, subject to other eligibility criteria. There is also the original $600 million for decarbonisation, and that is available to a broad range of safeguard participants. </span>

The government is developing the funding allocation approach, including the delivering entity for both the $600 million fund and the $400 million fund, as part of the budget. For clarity, I can run through with you again the eligibility for both of those because I want to make sure that we are both talking about the same thing, so I would like to just run through it with you specifically. There are two streams, and I'll give them their proper names so that we can talk about the same things. The safeguard transformation stream will provide dedicated funding for projects that reduce emissions at safeguard facilities that are trade exposed. That stream will support projects that reduce emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism, specifically, and eligible facilities' scope 1 emissions. It is intended to be technology and project neutral and can support a range of project types like energy efficiency upgrades, shifts to lower-carbon processes and fuel switching. The second stream, which I think is the one you were originally asking about, is a $400 million stream of funding that's been announced for industries providing critical inputs to clean energy industries, and, as I indicated now, the program guidelines will be developed for both of these programs in the coming months. </span>

The $600 million fund is the safeguard transformation stream. That is funding that will reduce emissions at safeguard facilities that are trade exposed. The definition of a trade exposed activity is defined by what are called 'production variables', and they exist in the draft rules that have been published alongside this legislation.</span>

That's not specific to particular kinds of facilities or particular kinds of activities. It's true across the board.</span>

Anyone who is making an investment at the moment I think already understands that they will be required, whether as a consequence of international markets or their investor community or of regulatory arrangements or some other pressure, to move to low-carbon arrangements. What the implementation of these reforms will do is give anyone who is seeking to make a decision some measure of certainty about what the government of Australia expects of them in contributing to our transformation to a low-carbon economy.</span>

Based on that answer, a lithium miner could be worse off. They would at least have knowledge of what the government wants them to do and certainty in that regard. In terms of their ability to undertake this process if they're impacted, they could be worse off than they currently are.</span>

They'd be very interested to know that. In terms of lithium mining itself, some companies are being provided with a subsidy, a grant or support through other measures provided by the federal government. Certainly when we were in government we wanted to increase the mining and processing of critical minerals, such as lithium, obviously, which supports Australia's energy transition. In terms of whether they're worse off or not, if they're currently receiving the grants, the subsidies or support but they are impacted by these changes—so, they've been given this grant, subsidy or support to undertake the mining and processing of the critical minerals—is there some way to ensure that they are no worse off as a result of being impacted by the changes?</span>

I suppose there are a range of characteristics, in scheme design, which seek to respond to the individual circumstances of particular activities. In particular, on Monday the minister indicated his intention to establish a distinct test for manufacturing entities, so as to assess whether or not they would be eligible for an adjusted baseline. To the extent that people are engaged with activity associated with manufacturing, there are some very particular arrangements. But I think your question is very general in nature. </span>

We are conscious that the development of a market for carbon and carbon sequestration presents an opportunity for landholders. You're quite right that landholders may choose to realise that in different ways, and you contemplate the possibility of sale as one of those options. I think the Chubb review gave some consideration to this, and recommended that the government continue to support individuals and communities in their engagement with that process. We're working through how to implement that. I made reference to a specific program that provides individual advice. I understand the broader question that I think you're alluding to. That is something that the government is alive to, but this bill is not a place where this is being pursued.</span>

That has been the baseline of what farmland is worth. Here's a piece of land; how much agricultural produce can I sustainably draw from this land? We've also got a long-term process in the agricultural sector where efficiency gains and modernising and different agricultural methodologies have meant that being able to purchase your next-door neighbour has been essential to agricultural survival in the long term. I'll ask you the question, Minister: this completely changes the economic dynamics and valuation of agricultural land. By saying what you just said you're effectively agreeing with that.</span>

I suppose part of the thing that might influence your thinking on this is that the enhanced carbon sequestration on a property is not incompatible with continuing agricultural production. In fact, there are plenty of places where that is taking place right now. It's also not the only alternative use for agricultural land. If we think about some of the pressures on agricultural land, they are widespread and diverse. It is an ongoing and general question that a country ought to be thinking about carefully. I think you're assuming that these things are mutually exclusive. In many examples they are not.</span>

This risks taking that equation and completely wiping it out on the back of companies wishing to survive having to achieve certain obligations, not being able to do it within the timeframes required through technological means, and therefore being left with no option, if there is no technological solution, the only meaningful, viable, realistic option for them is to buy up agricultural land and lock it up. That has flow-on impact on communities right across regional Australia. It has flow-on impact on agricultural industries as agricultural industries are made smaller and their economies of scale decline and the chance of those industries folding altogether becomes much, much more realistic. This is not a hypothetical. This is happening in regional WA at the moment, where large entities are buying up agricultural land effectively to lock it up.</span>

They ensure that Australians have well-paid jobs. But you're telling me that the government has not done a broad framework of modelling of any description to identify the cost to Australian industry and potentially the cost to Australian jobs? I want to clarify this because I think this is a very serious matter for Australia.</span>

I think there is an exceptional flaw in the modelling of this proposal and this policy if I can tell you that this will have, at a bare minimum, hundreds of millions of dollars of impost in taxes from our most-successful and highest-tax-paying industries and employers, and the government has not done any modelling. I think this is a massive flaw in this policy, and I can only imagine the views of the government in opposition on how they would have held us to task for having failed to have done this. I appreciate that you believe you've said something to Senator Duniam and Senator Hughes, but I think that industry and people who rely on these companies will be pretty shocked to discover that there has not been specific modelling around this framework that identified a cost to Australia and Australian businesses.</span>

In his contribution he talked about the hard cap, if I understood what he was saying, and the connection to another point that he made, which was that 58 projects were not going to proceed based on the implementation of the hard cap. I think I have what he said right, and you can correct me if you think I might be wrong. I'm wondering if you have a list of the 58 projects that might not proceed under this. </span>

We are grateful for the Greens' willingness to negotiate, to discuss and to provide ideas about how to strengthen the policy that we took to the election. With respect to Senator Shoebridge and his colleagues, we do not accept that characterisation of the effect of the policy, so I will run through the amendment that we do in fact propose. It is that net emissions, which include offsets, by implication, must not exceed 1,233 million tonnes between '21-22 and '29-30 and that aggregate emissions must reduce over time. It does not change the elemental design feature of the proposal we put forward, which is to allow for entrants and also to allow for expansion of production of existing covered entities. With respect to colleagues, we don't consider that characterisation accurate. </span>

Thirty per cent is a big chunk, considering we good Western Australians make up 6.9 per cent of the population. Can you guarantee that, because of the changes that have been implemented as part of this bill and the amendments that have been agreed to with the Greens, there won't be projects, particularly in Western Australia, that would have been viable but will no longer be viable? Can you guarantee that that is not the case?</span>

Let me pause and gather my thoughts. The bill anticipates establishing a baseline for each of the covered facilities and then establishing a decline rate for them which, in the ordinary course of things, would be 4.9 per cent annually but under certain circumstances might be reduced. We canvassed these in discussions with other colleagues. The proposed decline rate includes explicit consideration of emissions from new developments consistent with the way that we treat those in our emissions projections that are already produced by government each year. New developments include new facilities, backfill projects and expansions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I tried to indicate to you in my earlier answer, the arrangements that are being put in place today don't alter that. What they do is establish a requirement that, on occasions when the environment minister makes an approval that will increase the emissions from a covered facility, that information is automatically transferred to the secretary of the department of climate change, to the minister and to the Climate Change Authority. That transfer of information, as you would probably understand, would occur in many instances anyway. This formalises it as a requirement on the minister for the environment. Under certain circumstances, if the Climate Change Authority or the secretary of the department considers that, on receipt of that information, we are at risk of not meeting the objects of the act, which are to reduce emissions, they must make that analysis available to the minister, who must then set in train some steps to try and remedy it. Those steps could be a change to the overall rule or they could be some other step that the minister considers necessary to achieve the objects of the act. Nothing about that alters the way that the minister for the environment would provide approvals. Nothing about that provides a capacity for the minister for climate change to stop or halt a project. I think it's important to be quite clear about that.</span>

Minister, in one of your answers to Senator Brockman earlier, you mentioned the ministerial veto for projects whereby human induced regeneration may exceed 30 per cent of the farm. As you rightly pointed out, we brought the ministerial veto in when we were in government, in response to industry concerns. Do I take it from your answer that there will be no change to the 30 per cent ministerial veto in that legislation?</span>

I also indicate that we've had some discussion with a number of senators—and I thank you all for your questions and your engagement—about the concerns as they are expressed. I think it's important to be clear about what the position of the National Farmers Federation is. They have, as you've indicated, raised questions about the interaction between the safeguard mechanism and farms, but they have said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need to find the balance between delivering carbon offsets and meeting our global food and fibre demands.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, this also means supporting farmers to make informed business decisions about their participation in carbon markets. That's why we're calling for greater investment in on-ground extension services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's a very constructive approach from the NFF. As I've indicated to other senators, a first step in our thinking about the recommendations that came to us from Professor Chubb is the implementation of arrangements for on-ground advice. That program was funded, I think, in the last budget.</span>

I appreciate that you've mentioned the Chubb review a couple of times tonight, and I'm glad you have, because I have real concerns about the deal struck with the Greens relating to the Australian carbon credit units and human induced regeneration.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you've quite rightly pointed out, farmers very much understand that the climate is changing. They live the reality every day. From droughts to flooding rains they manage their lands. Every farmer wants to find the balance. Commodity group after commodity group is working towards net zero. They know it's not only good for the planet but also really good for their market access. That's why farmers have actually embraced the exchange of human induced regeneration projects within reason, within a percentage of their land, as ACCUs. But now we see the risk through this backroom deal that you've done with the Greens to get their flawed policy through this place. When the Greens announced their deal with the government, Adam Bandt said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The agreement will significantly improve the integrity of ACCUs with a freeze on the most dubious offset class (Human Induced Regeneration) until they are subject to an independent audit.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as you've mentioned, we've already had the Chubb review, and in Minister Bowen's press release he did not mention anything about a freeze. So who do we believe, Minister? Do we believe the Greens or do we believe that the ACCUs will not change?</span>

I have canvassed this reasonably extensively earlier in the day. The commitment we've provided over the last few days is very specific and relates very directly to the Chubb review. It relates even more specifically to recommendation 8 from Professor Chubb. That recommendation essentially makes a set of observations about how the test associated with the human-induced regeneration method ought to be applied. We have made clear that we expect that method and that interpretation to be considered in issuing any new credits to projects established under the human-induced regeneration method. We expect that the way that would happen would be in the ordinary process by which project proponents approach the Clean Energy Regulator and seek to have their credits allocated on the basis of activities undertaken under the project. I hope that makes it clear. We wouldn't characterise it in quite the same way as you've described just now.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Minister, there've been a lot of questions and concern today from those opposite about the impact of our reforms on the business community. I understand that there's actually been considerable support for the government's safeguard mechanism policy design from business advocates and that there's considerable support on the record. For example, from the BCA, Jennifer Westacott said about these safeguard reforms:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… my message to all involved is let's pass this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… let's get it done, let's get some momentum so that we can get this big investment change happening …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were similar comments and similar endorsement from Andrew McKellar of ACCI. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The business community has been very clear in its support for reforms to the Safeguard Mechanism. This is the best way to secure the planning, investment and innovation that will underpin the decarbonisation of our economy without sacrificing reliability or affordability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also considerable support on the record from the Australian Industry Group, the AIG. Mr Willox said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While debate over the detail of the reformed Safeguard Mechanism will continue, the crediting Bill before Parliament is essential policy infrastructure and it is strongly in everyone's interest to pass it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Willox also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is time for the Parliament to come to a workable agreement on the current package of Safeguard Mechanism reforms so that the private and public sectors can get on with the transition to a net zero emissions economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note further the comments that were actually made just yesterday, I think—I think yesterday was 28 March, it's been a bit of a time-space vortex in here recently, but I think these comments were made yesterday—from Manufacturing Australia on 28 March and those comments take into account all of the debate that's been happening over the last few days. Manufacturing Australia said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes are sensible and pragmatic. It's now vital that we get the details and the implementation right, to enable the multi-decade investments that are needed to underpin low emissions manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great, of course, to hear that support from our manufacturing sector as recently as yesterday that the changes are sensible and they're pragmatic, and it's vital that we continue now with the implementation phase and get that right so that industry can get on with the long-term investment that they need to transform to low-emissions manufacturing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's not just in the manufacturing sector that we have seen this support from business and from industry. I have also seen comments that I wanted your reaction to, Minister. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are committed to reducing our total emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 15% by 2026 and 50% by 2035, both on 2019 levels. Post 2035, our ambition is to achieve net zero total emissions by 2050, with a supportive policy environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard today figures about just how many of the businesses that are covered by the reformed safeguard mechanism already have those net zero total emissions targets by 2050, and Glencore is clearly one of those. Their website explains it really well. The website says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We aim to be a net zero total emissions company by 2050. This means we're not only reducing the direct emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions), but also those created from the use of our products (Scope 3).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fantastic to see the great ambition there from Glencore, the support that they have for the safeguard mechanism and their desire to see a supportive policy environment that gives them the certainty that they need for their business to go forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also had on the record support from the Minerals Council of Australia. Ms Constable said to the Senate inquiry back in February, speaking about where the mining industry is at with reducing emissions:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The mining industry recognises that there is a very big task that is required to reduce emissions, and we have been on that path for a long time. The minerals industry has signed onto net zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, they are already well on the way and looking for the certainty and stability of the types of reforms that the government is putting forward this week in the Senate. She went on to say that they have made that target. Then she went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have not been sitting on our hands waiting for policy change. We have been making that change over time. In 2020, the Minerals Council of Australia and its members released our first climate action plan. Since that time we have reported on an annual rolling basis our activities across the industry. It has been measured and, as I said, it has been recorded. MCA members have around about 39 separate activities that go from fuel switching—changing out of current energy sources to new energy sources—autonomous operations, renewable energy, battery storage, digitisation, a whole range of issues on site and in our headquarters, so across all of our operations. That is ongoing and will continue to be ongoing. It is a hard task, but every member is taking action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is tremendous to see that level of support from the business community for these safeguard reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The BCA's Jennifer Westacott has said, 'Let's get on and pass this bill.' ACCI said, 'The business community has been very clear in its support for reforms to the Safeguard Mechanism,' and that it's the way forward for decarbonising our economy. The AiG said that of course there will be implementation questions and of course there will be detailed questions, but that this is 'essential policy infrastructure'. They say that it is time for the parliament to come to a workable agreement, which is what we're here to do, of course, this week in the parliament. Again, of course, as recently as yesterday, in taking on board all of the debates that have been happening in and around the parliament, we see that Manufacturing Australia have said that these changes are 'sensible and pragmatic'. That's what we aim to be as we get on with the job of delivering net zero by 2050 and reducing our emissions over the next several years to 2030 as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, what type of support does the proposed safeguard mechanism have from the business community?</span>

                    <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Mana</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">gement</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:00</span>):  Thank you, Senator Walsh, for that very comprehensive discussion of what the business community actually thinks about the safeguard mechanism. I think it was refreshing to hear a contribution that put on the record what the business community actually has to say and actually thinks about the safeguard mechanism to counter the fear campaign that we've seen from the opposition not just over the last couple of days but, sadly, for the best part of 10 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you've made clear, Senator Walsh, from those comments that you referred to from groups as wide-ranging as the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Minerals Council of Australia, Glencore, Manufacturing Australia and others—let's face it, these are not organisations that have necessarily always seen eye to eye with the Labor Party—when it comes to taking sensible action on climate change, which is designed to build and secure businesses and jobs well into the future, we are on the same page with these business organisations. Like them, we know and understand the science that tells us that we do need to take action on climate change. We understand that investors are increasingly seeking these changes to be made. We're not denying the reality of what's happening. We're not continuing to play the stick-our- head-in-the-sand game that has been going on in this country on one side of politics for 10 years. We are actually facing up to the reality and putting in place policies, in partnership with business, that will allow for sensible action to be taken on climate change while also securing jobs and securing investment well into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that, allegedly at least, a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 is supported by all sides of politics, although we know that there are a number of people in the opposition, including Senator Canavan and others, who never really agreed with it. They were sort of bound by this policy that they never really agreed with. But allegedly the opposition supports net zero emissions by 2050. If it is the case that you support bringing those emissions down by 2050, it can't be done unless we reduce emissions from our 215 biggest emitters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all that those in the opposition have spent all day, all week, all year, all decade pretending that these things can't be done and it will be the end of the world, the fact is that the very businesses, the very representatives of heavy industry who the safeguard mechanism already applies to, are taking action on these things already. Rio Tinto, Shell and Alcoa, all heavy-emitting companies with heavy-emitting facilities that the safeguard mechanism already applies to—because let's remember that this was actually a policy dreamt up by the then government, who are now in opposition—all of those companies are all reducing their emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Fortescue Metals Group, again a heavy-emitting company with heavy-emitting operations, is committed to carbon neutrality by 2030. Boral is reducing emissions by 46 percent by 2030. And on the examples that Senator Canavan and others have put up over the last few days about coalmining companies—well, coalmining companies like Glencore, Anglo-American and BHP all have very detailed net zero commitments. In fact, 80 per cent of safeguard businesses, which cover around 86 per cent of safeguard emissions, have a commitment to net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Canavan knows, I spend a lot of time in Central Queensland, as does Senator Chisholm. And, unlike Senator Canavan, when we're in Central Queensland we actually open our eyes to what's already happening in these areas. It doesn't really work for Senator Canavan to deal in the real world—to open his eyes and see what's actually happening in Central Queensland. We all know that he's got this narrative which he has to feed into <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky After Dark</span> and all these websites and bots that follow him. We know that's all that really motivates him. It doesn't really suit his narrative, or the LNP's narrative in Queensland, to actually see facilities like the Boyne Smelter or the Yarwun facility in Gladstone. Again, Senator Chisholm and I have spent a lot of time in those; probably more than Senator Canavan, actually. He doesn't like to go to the facilities that are doing these things. He prefers to wander around Rockie and Central Queensland, whipping up fear but never setting foot in the facilities that are making these changes. That's because it would require him and others to acknowledge the actual reality that these companies are already doing these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go to the Boyne Smelter, operated by Rio Tinto, or to the Yarwun facility just outside Gladstone, also operated by Rio Tinto—and, as I said, Senator Canavan doesn't like to set foot in these premises because he would actually have to listen to what's going on there—as Senator Chisholm, Senator Green and I have on a regular basis, and the Prime Minister, Rio Tinto will tell you that at the Boyne Smelter they're already undertaking work about how they can rely increasingly on renewable energy to power their operations that produce aluminium. If you go to the alumina refinery at Yarwun, which Rio Tinto operates just outside Gladstone, they're already trialling the use of hydrogen as a replacement for gas. And guess who helped them fund that? It was actually the former government, the LNP government, who said they didn't support these things but who were providing money on the side to the companies to do the exact same thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go to the gas plants on Curtis Island at Gladstone, they'll tell you about the work they're doing to reduce their emissions and flaring. If you actually go to the coalmines in Central Queensland they'll tell you about the work they're doing to reduce their emissions. I know that doesn't work for Senator Canavan and I know it doesn't work for the National Party to actually go and talk to the workers.</span>

                    </a>  As I was saying, if you actually bothered to turn up and go to the Boyne Smelter or to Yarwun, or to the gas plants or the coalmines across Central Queensland, all these places where apparently this can't be done and it's going to be the end of the world, the management and the workers will tell you when you go there that they're already doing these things. I know that doesn't help; I know that Senator Canavan, Senator McKenzie and other members of the Liberal National Party of Queensland would much prefer to pretend that this thing isn't happening already and that the legislation we're in the process of passing will be the end of the world, but this is exactly what's happening right now in these facilities. At last, our country and places like Central Queensland have a government that's acknowledging reality and acknowledging that things are changing—that actually these facilities need a government and a policy environment that will assist them to make the changes they're already making. The other part of the reforms that we've announced is what is now $1 billion in financial support, from the federal government, to these facilities that are facing international competition.</span>

These characters, over here, who've been holding back progress in places like Central Queensland for the last 10 years and are continuing to deny reality also want to stop support for these companies from locking in jobs in the long term. They'd much rather have their political games, the nonsense they've been carrying on with for 10 years, and putting the jobs of these workers at risk rather than acknowledging reality and working with the companies with this change. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:11</span>):  First of all, I want to correct the record a little bit about my movements. Apparently, Senator Watt is very interested in where I travel to. I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic, because last year I took my wife to 17 coalmines in four days. We had a great time travelling around Central Queensland. So the idea that I don't go to these facilities or talk to these workers—I actually travel there regularly and travel with my family, because we live in Central Queensland. We love the place. We love the people in the place and the wealth they produce for the nation, and we never get enough gratitude. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't hear one word of thanks from Senator Watt in his long screed against me, about how evil I am and how terrible we all are on this side, not one word to the people of Central Queensland, not one word of gratitude. The whole budget of the Labor Party is basically being bankrolled, at the moment, by the hard work of the men and women in the coal industry and other resource industries, but especially coal, over the last year. It's our nation's biggest export. There's been not a single word. We never hear it from the Labor Party. They never say thanks to the people who work in this industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record, at the start of my contribution, 'Thank you.' I thank those workers for what they do for our nation. They spend long periods of the year away from their families, often, because they're in remote locations, living in a donga, without anyone to sleep next to at night. But their work helps us be the prosperous and rich nation that we are. So I just want to put on the record that I thank them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish the Labor Party could be bipartisan about this, but they simply can't seem to recognise the achievements of the coal industry. You never hear them say anything about what an achievement it's been to open up a new coal basin for the first time in 50 years in the Galilee, the Adani project. We fought tooth and nail against a bunch of radical greenies, funded by globalists to try and stop that, and the Labor Party never says a single word about it, never welcomes it. You never hear them mention it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why not? Are they not proud of the coal industry? Are they not proud of the 2,000 Central and North Queenslanders that work at the Adani Carmichael mine? Do they care about their futures at all? You never hear them talk about them. It's all about us. They want to talk about the coalition and how terrible we are. I just want to put on record how important the coal industry is in this country and how proud I am to support and fight for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was going to go to some other places, but I thought it was also important—after that particularly partisan screed from Minister Watt; he really should be above that, now that he's a minister—to put on the record the actual positions of businesses in the coal sector, especially after the sellout that the Labor Party's engaged in this week for workers' interests to the Greens. They have absolutely sold out the interests of those who work in coal and gas and other mining sectors, which I'm sure I'll get a chance to come to tonight. As a result of that sellout deal, here are a few quotes—some actual quotes—from companies in the coal industry today. This deal only happened in the last couple of days. We still don't have a lot of basic details about it. I asked a question about the impact on the Olive Downs mine in question time the other day. There were no answers, and there are still no answers about whether or not the 500 people who work at that mine today still have a job. Where is the certainty for them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are a few quotes today reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. The first is from Paul Flynn from Whitehaven Coal, a great Australian company. It has done remarkable things, especially around Narrabri in northern New South Wales. It's a fantastic coalmine; it's another one I've been to, Murray. It's one of the best in the country, actually. It's special. Go and check that out. Paul Flynn says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nearly 70 per cent of Japan's thermal coal imports come from Australia so it exposes them to a material new risk in terms of security of energy supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is his view about the Labor Party's deal with the Greens. He continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the midst of a global shortage of energy, and considering alternative technologies aren't ready to pick up the slack from the 80 per cent of primary energy derived from fossil fuels today, it's mind-boggling the government has entertained these concessions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the coal industry thinks, Minister Watt. The minister didn't mention or address Paul Flynn's concerns in his contribution. The article also quotes Bowen Coking Coal chief Nick Jorss, who is another great Australian. These people are just fantastic Australians. They work hard and they take risks. They're just great people. They're larrikins. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> article said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nick Jorss said Labor was entering "extremely dangerous and uncharted territory" with a "carbon tax by stealth" that would limit Australia's high-quality, low-emissions coal exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the coal industry has said today, Minister Watt. In your next partisan screed—instead of focusing so much on me and how terrible I am—maybe you should respond to Mr Jorss, who is an investor and has built amazing businesses in the coal industry. Respond to him and say why he is wrong. Mr Jorss goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Global coal demand is at the highest level in history—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">he's right about that—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">and it's fanciful to think that reducing our high-quality exports in the face of record demand will do anything other than drive up energy and steel prices, create a net increase in global emissions and destroy Australian jobs, both in regions and in cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Jorss doesn't sound too supportive of the government's measures. Apparently, Minister Watt wants to mislead the Senate because he does not recognise the comments there of Mr Jorss. I'll move on. New Hope Group, another business that has been totally screwed over by Labor government's for many years, finally got their project approval after 12 years. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> article says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">New Hope Group chief executive Rob Bishop said the amendments were built on "a political objective on a base demonisation of fossil fuels" and that they would see Australia abandon its role as a reliable energy exporter for the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is more criticism from the coal industry that Minister Watt has failed to address in any of his contributions. The article continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">President of Peabody's Australian operations, Jamie Frankcombe, said the company was concerned the legislation would "make the mining industry less competitive at a time when it's integral to providing the minerals and energy required for the energy transition".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where's the support here? There's no support. Mr Frankcombe goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The very real danger in setting aspirational emission reduction targets and imposing rigid rules to achieve them is that it will reduce our cost competitiveness, lead to potential job losses and hurt regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the communities, Minister Watt, that you fly in and fly out of. You don't actually live there. The article further states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A spokesman for Glencore said the reforms needed to achieve emissions reductions without "destroying the jobs and investments that are critical to the national economy".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on and on. There are more comments from the gas industry too, which I'll perhaps get to later this evening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get to some more detailed questions, I want to put into context what we're doing. I touched on this in my second reading debate contribution, but I want to make a comparison. We're putting all these costs and risks on the coal industry and other industries, whose concerns have been outlined in the article I've quoted. In terms of the benefit that we are going to get from this bill, according to the government's own target set out in their position paper on the safeguard mechanism, this will reduce carbon emissions by 205 million tonnes. That's the reduction they'll achieve. That sound like a lot, but a couple of weeks ago on 13 March this year, the Biden administration approved the Willow project in Alaska, which will produce 180,000 barrels of oil a day. That one project is going to produce a total of 263 million tonnes of emissions. So we've spent all this time here this week—and we're going to be here until God knows what hour again tonight—lauding ourselves and saying how fantastic we are because the tides are not rising anymore, the temperature is falling and we can already feel it get colder. Apparently we're shifting the world here in this little room. And, after all this effort and with all of the uncertainty we'll impose on the major industries that bankroll our nation, all we're going to do is reduce our emissions by 205 million times. Meanwhile, one decision of the so-called climate-conscious Democratic elected Biden administration, 263 million tonnes from that one decision in Alaska, completely blows out of the water everything we've done and more. ConocoPhillips, who are the proponents of the Willow project, used to invest in Australia, too. They largely don't anymore; they sold out of Darwin, unfortunately, so we've lost them. ConocoPhillips released to the stock exchange in New York that they welcomed the decision from Houston. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You know what? In their whole media release announcing the Willow project there was not a single mention of carbon emissions. No mention of offsetting them or going to net zero—not a single mention. Do you know what they did mention, though, which again Minister Watt failed to mention his contribution at all? This is what ConocoPhillips said: 'The Willow project fits within the Biden administration's priority of environmental and social justice, facilitating the energy transition and enhancing our energy security all while creating good union jobs.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Good union jobs—that's what the coal industry provides. I back those unions and I stand with the CFMMEU supporting the industry. These guys don't ever mention it. Where is the mention of the union jobs here that you're going to destroy through these policies? Because if you don't, if we have the reaction we've seen from the coal industry and we don't get the investment, we're not going to get those good union jobs. They'll go to Alaska and the Middle East and China and Russia, and they won't be here in this country anymore. So I don't care how much you criticise me. I will keep fighting for those good union jobs, because you are not. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:21</span>):  I foreshadow that I will move amendments on sheet 1920 standing in my name when my time comes, but I want to take the opportunity to outline those amendments now. As the legislation currently stands this very broad power under section 33 of the Industry Research and Development Act gives various ministers the power to make grants on wide grounds. So long as they are within the legislative power of the Commonwealth they can throw as much money as they want at it. This provision was the pipeline that the Morrison government used to throw cash at its gas fired recovery, but this amendment, which I understand has the support of the Senate, will turn that tap off. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Money for the purposes of subsidising coal and gas construction will now be prohibited. This is one less pool of money that the fossil fuel industry can dip their greedy little hands into. The previous government actually gave money through this provision to hand $50 million to frack the Beetaloo Basin against the wishes of traditional owners. Gas companies that made donations to the Liberals and flew together in private jets—I wonder if Senator McKenzie was part of that jaunt—with former Minister Taylor received public money under this provision. Empire Energy received $19 million and Tamboran received $7.5 million. But today it's my great pleasure to announce to the chamber that since the announcement of the package that the Greens negotiated with the government on Monday the stock value of Tamboran and has fallen by 15 per cent and Empire Energy stocks have fallen by 22 per cent. How about that! This section 33 power was also used to bankroll—</span>

As a preamble to my question, I want to state clearly for the record and draw the Senate's attention to the reality that, right now, global temperatures are rising, and have risen, by about 1.2 degrees above their pre-industrial level, and it is very clear from the work of the world's finest climate scientists that, with every decade that goes past and every year that goes past, those temperatures continue to rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paris Agreement goal, adopted just eight years ago in 2015, was to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. We are already, as I say, at 1.2 degrees Celsius and on track for another 0.2 degrees of warming as we go through this decade. The reality that we are faced with now as a species upon this planet is that every single year that passes without meaningful action on climate is a year in which we slip closer to an irretrievable climate disaster. What exactly that will mean in real terms is difficult to comprehend when we are already seeing catastrophic once-in-a-generation climate events unfolding with an alarming regularity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These dire straits are reflected in the final part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth annual report, released last week. This is the world's official body for the assessment of climate change telling us in the clearest possible terms, and not for the first time, that we need a rapid, deep, systems-wide emissions reduction program. The time, as they say, is well and truly up. The climate bomb is uncomfortably close to boom time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An idealistic view—and I say this generously—of the safeguards mechanism bill Labor introduced to the House is that it was an attempt to defuse that bomb. A more realistic view is that this was largely a piece of legislation built on smoke and mirrors—or woodsmoke, more precisely, as we stare down the barrel of another potentially catastrophic La Nina summer this year—because the bill that Labor originally presented to the House was not in fact a climate bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By its design it allowed big, cashed-up polluters to continue business as usual. All that they would need to do is find a little bit more cash by making a little bit more money from the next global energy crisis to buy some crappy offsets to offset their big pollution and exceed their allocated level of pollution. By design, Labor's original bill allowed big polluters to offset 100 per cent of their emissions, something many nations economically and ideologically comparable to Australia had made illegal. By design, Labor's original bill allowed big polluters to increase their emissions, as long as their number crunchers were good enough at their jobs to make it look otherwise on paper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's right—under the original bill put forward by Labor, national emissions from coal and gas could go up, and were in fact forecast to go up. The government would be able to claim that they had succeeded in reducing national emissions, all thanks to some sly climate accounting. And emissions would of course go up because the bill that the government originally brought to the house backed in new coal and gas development—some 116 in the pipeline in front of the government right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if, by some stroke of magic, the bill in its original form had actually reduced emissions, any climate gain would have been completely written off by just one new project alone: the Burrup Hub in my home state of Western Australia. What we see in this reality is a community in Western Australia forced to take up the fight against these projects directly, because they know that their government will do nothing more than tinker around the edges on climate policy. One of the members of my team, somebody who I am proud to call a colleague, Joanna Partyka, recently took up this very fight with her brave protest against Woodside as part of the 'Disrupt Burrup Hub' campaign. I want to pay tribute to that courageous activist group this evening. For her climate activism, like many others engaged in similar actions around the country, Jo is being pursued by the police. She had her home raided by the counterterrorism police. This is the dystopian reality that the government has created. The pre-eminent global climate body sounds the alarm for immediate action, and the brave folk responding to that alarm are being criminalised. Meanwhile, the government quietly shuffles the papers around, trying not to draw attention to itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reality has been created because the government—particularly this Labor government, along with its counterpart at the state level—basically functions as a subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry. Their friends, the oil and gas barons, masquerade as members of the WA community, upstanding in their nature, while those in the government play the role of their elected representatives in this place—a thinly veiled front for Woodside, Rio Tinto and Chevron. That's the reality of who the Greens have been negotiating with through the course of this process. That's the reality of who the government is up against in this fight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that the Greens have secured ensure that real pollution will actually go down. What a radical idea! It's not just on paper: the introduction of a hard cap on actual emissions, one that will be ratcheted down over time is a welcome step. Also secured by our amendments is the work to rein in dodgy offsets, ensuring that big polluters can't continue to buy their way out of responsibility to abate emissions. As a whole, we believe that our amendments will place a huge financial burden on many of the 116 coal projects in the pipeline under this government, ultimately making it less likely for them to go ahead. But as this legislation, improved as it has been, is considered before the Senate tonight it is the community's right to know how often Woodside was consulted in the crafting of the original piece of legislation. This company treats my state of Western Australia as its playground, has made money from our resources for decades and happily lends a bit of it out here and there to buy social license from the creative industries to put themselves forward as a friend of the community—all the while profiting from the extraction and burning of chemicals and pollutants that ruin our environment. So, Minister, how often were they at the table during the course of the crafting of this legislation?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:34</span>):  Senator Steele-John, thank you for your contribution. I actually find it disappointing that you've chosen this evening to minimise what is actually quite an important moment for this parliament. We have had 10 years where the previous government was unable to settle a climate policy and consequently unable to settle an energy policy, and the consequences of that are playing out each and every day for households all over this country and for businesses. They're playing out for the climate too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You're quite right to call attention to the IPCC report, and you're quite right to point to the fact that this is a critical decade. Actually, the last decade was the critical decade. That was the decade when it would have been good to get on the path to net zero. Regrettably, the government that was in place then chose not to do so. They couldn't land a policy amongst themselves. The Nats bickered with the Libs, and the outer metropolitan Libs bickered with the inner metropolitan Libs, and nothing happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It matters a great deal to stabilise climate and energy policy in this country. For the first time, we have a parliament where the stated position of a majority of senators and members is for climate action. We are really proud to have had the opportunity as a government to bring forward meaningful and significant reforms that will put us on a path to net zero, to do the hard work that is necessary to build ambition, to build a global coalition, to deal with this problem which we know can only be tackled by collective global action. That's our responsibility. It's our responsibility as a government, and I would put it to you that it's our responsibility as a parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shame about the way that you approach your contribution—I'm sorry, I don't wish to scold you, Senator Steele-John, but I do wish you point out our differences in approach. We are grateful for the very constructive engagement we had with your leader and with your party room. We think it's important that people of goodwill can work together across the parliament, and we are genuinely grateful for it. I do wish to acknowledge that. You asked me a question, and I will get to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken on many occasions—some of the people who have been in the chamber for much of this afternoon might be a little bit tired of this explanation. One of the things about stabilising climate policy and establishing an enduring and durable policy solution is working with stakeholders across the board, and we make absolutely no apologies for having met with as many of the participants in the existing safeguard mechanism as possible. It was a long consultation process. From recollection, we announced our policy prior to the election; following the election we published a consultation paper last August and we sought feedback; we released legislation, I think, in December; we published a further detailed paper along with draft rules in January. We have sought to engage deeply with civil society and with business to deeply understand what the implications of this reform would be. I'm not going to provide information about the specifics of who met what when, because the truth is there's been an enormous amount of engagement right across the spectrum. I do think that is a good thing. It's how we should do policy, and I think that we are going to get a good result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to another matter, I did promise earlier to provide advice to Senator Cash about the approach for lithium hydroxide producers. She asked me very specific question. I can advise the chamber that lithium hydroxide producers who enter the safeguard mechanism from 1 July 2023 will enter as new entrants, and as a consequence they will have new entrant baselines. The value of those baselines will be set through consultation with industry and other stakeholders during 2023.</span>

The Greens political party was not here at 3.30, nor at 4.13 am today, but Labor Party senators were.

Was EY charged with modelling the impact on each individual sector impacted by the safeguard mechanism? Was this done at an enterprise level? Because surely that will be the only way the government can ascertain the impact on specific geographic regions. And did the government rely on financial data collected at a corporate level to work out the impact on each facility? I appreciate that those three questions will go to the same answer. </span>

This is quite a simple question, and the committee stage in the Senate is for us to actually ascertain what the impact is on our communities. You won the war—away you go—but we need to understand what genuine assessment the government has done to understand the impact of their decision-making on our communities and our industries. I'm very concerned if (a) that wasn't detailed analysis, (b) that didn't go to the facility level, or (c) that didn't actually consult with enterprises themselves. We've all got the list, and we've all got the database—we know the number 215. But what is going to be the impact of that, and did you rely on financial data collected at the corporate level to work out the impact? If the departmental officials in front of you don't have that information available to them, I would find that very concerning, given the potential impact that this legislation will have on our communities.</span>

                    </a>  Senator McAllister, unless you are seeking public interest immunity over this information, this is precisely the forum in which we are justified in asking these questions. You are putting this legislation forward. It will become law. Where else do we actually get these answers from? We know EY did the modelling. We want to understand whether you understood that from a facility level, whether you understood it from a geographic-place level and whether you actually understood. You talk about going to cabinet, so was cabinet informed of the impact, at a very local, granular level, of this legislation? If it wasn't, fine. If it was, what is it? You're asking the Senate to make a decision tonight on this legislation, but, without that level of information, you're asking us to do that blindly. You either have to claim public interest immunity or tell us what EY said—or maybe you didn't bother asking.</span>

It began last year and involved many workshops, round tables, meetings, submissions and a Senate hearing, and has been discussed at estimates. It's been a very extended discussion with a very wide range of people, and I think the policy process was the better for it. </span>

For these new fields' reservoir CO2 emissions best practice is zero, given the existence of low-CO2 fields and opportunities for carbon capture and storage. </span>

I was trying to find the piece of paper I relied upon the last time, so that I could provide consistent information to the chamber, but it's set out in the explanatory memorandum. Essentially, the intention of the change is to ensure that the minister, the climate change secretary and the Climate Change Authority have the necessary information about designated large facilities that may increase their scope 1 emissions, or new facilities that may become designated large facilities, and can appropriately monitor the impact of the achievement of the revised object of the NGERs. Essentially, the object of the NGER Act sets out, or will set out, the obligation to reduce emissions. Where the minister for the environment makes an approval that increases the emissions of a covered safeguard facility, a notification obligation arises to the secretary of the department, the Climate Change Authority and the minister. Obligations then attach to the secretary of the department and the Climate Change Authority to assess whether that information suggests that the objects of the act may not be met, and if that is the case they need to advise the minister and the minister needs to put in place a process to assess what steps, if any, need to be taken in response. As I indicated to Senator O'Sullivan, when he asked me this same question, it does not provide the ability for the minister for climate change to cancel or in any way change approval that's been provided under a separate act by a separate minister.</span>

This is not a technology that your government or the Greens is keen on promoting. This is proven technology that is working on 30 projects around the world, with more than 100 under development, and reducing emissions by 40 million tonnes, or one-tenth of Australia's emissions. Is the Australian government opposed to this technology, which is recognised globally as one of the technologies that will help the globe reduce emissions and get to net zero? This includes nuclear technologies, but I'm not asking about nuclear. Will CCUS technology be available to ports that are exporting Australian product, as is being done in large European ports, such as Rotterdam?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:58</span>):  Finally, last night when we were here to the wee hours talking about your recovery fund, Minister Farrell stood here and asked us not to conflate this particular deal with the Greens with the desire to build a manufacturing industry in Australia, which your fund seeks to do. I find it passing strange that, whilst today we are passing legislation that will impact significant employers, particularly in rural and regional Australia, the government has failed, in answering my questions—my apologies if you've answered Senator McDonald, Senator Brockman or Senator Canavan about jobs lost, jobs impacted or the impact to the 84 per cent of the 215 companies impacted. For the brief period I've had the opportunity, as Leader of the Nationals in this place, to question the government, what have you done to assess the impact on my people, my communities and my industries? You have failed to answer very basic questions. You give us nothing to take back to our communities for them to understand the impact of Canberra on their place. It's not a lot to ask. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a heavy responsibility that you've been given by the Australian people—the privilege to govern—but you have to govern for all of us. You have to make the tough decisions. That's your mandate. You will do the deals that you will do, but you also need to be able to explain the impact of your decisions to the rest of us who don't live in Fitzroy or inner-city Brisbane, Perth, Sydney or Melbourne. I've been very concerned about the giggles from the Greens when we've asked serious questions about working-class families in our places. They were simple questions, and you were unable to give responses. We clearly won't be supporting the bill, and it's simultaneously disappointing that we couldn't get simple answers to quite simple questions. That was a comment, not a question.</span>

It has been an extended committee stage, and, in the course of the discussion, we have canvassed the consultation arrangements, the analysis that has been undertaken and the level of support that has been provided by a very broad range of business organisations to establish the arrangements for Australian businesses to remain competitive in a world that is decarbonising. Senator McKenzie, I note your views. I can assure you that this government takes very seriously the opportunity to support rural and regional communities. It's something that's important to me and it's important to the government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:01</span>):  I thought I'd briefly correct the record there. The minister mentioned that the world is decarbonising. It's absolutely not. Carbon emissions are increasing and are set to hit record levels because other countries are not doing what we're doing. They're actually investing in their energy security. As I mentioned earlier, the Biden administration is opening up massive amounts of Alaska for oil drilling, and the UK is doing the same in the North Sea. The German Greens party are reopening 24 coal-fired power stations as we speak. Of course, China is building 104 gigawatts of coal-fired power just this year. That's roughly two coal-fired power stations a week. In the time it takes us to debate this bill and pass it through these two chambers, little old China will have built two coal-fired power stations and completely undermined what we're doing here.</span>

In particular, I want to discuss this question of new entrants, which I think is key. In discussions I've been having with concerned companies and investors in the past couple of days since the Labor Party's deal with the Greens, there's been a lot of concern about how new entrants will or won't be treated. There's not a lot of clarity in Minister Bowen's media release. The other day in the Senate, I asked about a specific case, which I might ask again. You've got advisers now, unlike in question time. They might be able to help you out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked about the specific case of the Olive Downs coalmine. I didn't get an answer from Minister Farrell, although I'm not Robinson Crusoe in that regard. Just to explain, Minister, the Olive Downs coalmine is going to be a mine in Central Queensland near Moranbah. It's under construction right now. It has got all of its approvals, of course. There are 500 people working at that mine right now. However, it's not on the safeguard mechanism's list. It's not one of the 215 facilities because it's not an operating mine yet. That will happen. It will go onto that list sometime in the next couple of years. Will it be treated as a new entrant, and, if so, what will its baseline be set at? The investors in this mine have done so on the basis of certain decisions. I don't want to reveal the conversations I've had, but it would be news to them if they were to be considered a new entrant. Will the Olive Downs mine be treated as a new entrant, and what will their baseline be? Can you give any certainty this evening to the 500 people working at that mine about their futures?</span>

As I understand it from the description you've provided, this mine is not currently covered by the safeguard mechanism, because it's not operating; it's under construction. I'm reluctant to make a specific assessment, but in general terms, an entity that commences production and trips the 100,000-tonne threshold would then be considered a safeguard covered facility. New entrants will be required to comply with best practice standards from the first day of operation. Those standards are going to be developed over the course of this year, in consultation with industry.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  It's amazing—and, again, I'll refer to my earlier comments—that a government which pretends to be in favour of worker rights and supporting workers can't give any certainty to 500 people employed today. This isn't people in the future; it's not a prospective thing. They're actually working there today. I'm happy to give you the call, Minister, when I conclude, but you have confirmed there for us—correct me if I'm wrong—that this mine will be treated as a new entrant. I think that might be news to the company itself. Clearly, there hasn't been a lot of consultation from the government. They have all their approvals and have been through an EPBC process—they're probably the most assessed mine proposal ever, probably in the world because of the way we go about these things. So I think they'll be quite disappointed at that answer. As I said, there are no guarantees then about the future from the government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key thing here will be the way this hard cap works. The way which Mr Bandt describes it is contributing to the uncertainty and confusion out there among investors. It's that big gap between how Mr Bandt describes the 'deal'—the 'sellout', if you like—and how Mr Bowen describes it. Mr Bandt has clear language which is easily interpreted; Mr Bowen has a bunch of bureaucrat-ese which no-one can really navigate. So I will draw you to Mr Bandt's media release, where he says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question is this: is the amount of this reserve that the government has flagged now fixed, given the agreement with Mr Bandt and the Greens? That is, will the government not entertain any change to the amount of the reserve between now and 2030? Also, what is the reserve—how much is the reserve, in millions of tonnes of carbon emissions?</span>

That cap is established by applying the 43 per cent reduction threshold to the covered facilities, including some estimates about increases in production activity. That cap is in the legislation and is established as a net cap, so it accounts for the offsets that have been the subject of quite a deal of discussion in recent times. The objects proposed for the act also establish a requirement that the gross emissions decrease over time, and it establishes a metric by which that decrease would be assessed.</span>

It's just a figure, Minister. All I'm asking is: how much is the reserve? I draw you to Mr Bowen's media release on the deal between the Labor Party and the Greens. The agreement is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">to not exceed the conservatively estimated 1,233 million tonnes of CO2-e to 2030 …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's the figure you were wanting for the overall cap of emissions. My question is not on that figure—a component of the 1,233 will be emissions by existing and, if we ever saw this modelling, possibly some new entrants. In other communications Mr Bowen has mentioned there is a reserve. You've got a specific figure for 1,233, and Minister Bowen has said there is a reserve within that 1,233 to account for new entrants—so there's new investment, which we need in Australia, especially in the energy space. My specific simple question is: how much is that reserve? How much of the 1,233 is set aside for growth from new entrants?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:11</span>):  It's quite remarkable that we're sitting here debating this. I know the government has been mouthing sweet nothings to companies concerned about this issue, saying, 'It's all right, we've got a reserve, it'll be fine, there'll be growth.' I was talking to some people at Aussie's just before about this; they're desperately trying to get information that they can't get from your own minister or the government. They're being told, 'There's a reserve, it's okay.' But you can't even tell us how much is in that reserve. It could be 10, five, 100. Is it enough to even account for or accommodate the Olive Downs mine and/or any others? You won't give me or the Australian people a figure of the reserve. I'll put that aside for now; I might come back to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question now is: what happens if the reserve is empty? What happens if we get other mines—some other senators have spoken of lithium mines, others that exceed the 100,000 tonne threshold—and they come into the system and are given this best practice formula, and they have a positive carbon emission impact, and that uses up some of this reserve? What happens when the reserve gets to zero? Say an Olive Downs project comes along; it's been approved and wants to come along. If the reserve is already at zero at that point, if the reserve is empty, and there's a proposal—it doesn't have to be a coalmine—for another facility to come in, that wants to invest in Australia, and they need to get approval and get credited through the safeguard mechanism, will they have to offset all their emissions? Just to explain this question: if the reserve is at zero, and then a new entrant comes in—if there's no reserve it doesn't matter what the best practice is or what form you want to create to get under your cap, which you're saying is a hard cap, in legislation now, of 1,233 million tonnes—to get under that 1,233 million tonnes they will have to offset all their emissions and be net zero from day one. I'm happy for you to point out where I'm going wrong here with this, but that seems to be the government's proposal because there's no flexibility in the cap.</span>

I appreciate it's a serious question and I'm happy to assist. You've been speaking about a reserve. It's true that a reserve was incorporated into the calculations to accommodate uncertainty. However, the calculations also included projections about new entrants. The reserve was an additional feature on top of that. The projections around emissions from new entrants are derived from the emissions projections that are produced each year by the department, which I think you would be familiar with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, you asked what would happen in the circumstances where the minister was notified that there was a new approval for a new facility of any kind and it would be likely that the fixed caps would not be able to be met, that the objects of the act were not able to be met. The consequence of that circumstance would be for the minister to undertake consultation about the rules as a whole. It would not be for the minister to engage or impose requirements on a particular project. I hope that assists.</span>

I do appreciate it. It helps a lot. I just go back to the reserve figure. I thought I remembered this and have brought it up. On 7 March there was an article on the ABC website titled 'Chris Bowen challenges parliament to accept safeguard mechanism, or risk losing chance to cut emissions'. Later on in the article Mr Bowen is quoted as saying:</span>

Something doesn't add up here. We've got a hard cap, we've got a reserve and we've got a growth factor as well for new entrants. They all have to add up to 1,233 million tonnes, because you're saying that that's the cap in the legislation. Now you're saying, 'No, we've changed the 17 million tonnes.' Mr Bowen was happy to tell the ABC that the reserve was 17 million tonnes. You must have a figure right now because your cap is 1,233 million tonnes. What is the figure of the reserve tonight? Has it changed from the 17 million tonnes? Please tell us. Mr Bowen already told the public this, so there's no public interest immunity here and no cabinet issues. He told the ABC what the reserve was. What is the reserve in your calculations tonight? You must have the spreadsheet back there that adds up to 1,233 million tonnes. What is the figure for the reserve?</span>

I've also explained to you that there is a proposal to shift that as a consequence of consultation with the manufacturing sector. You would expect our government to take a keen interest in representations from the manufacturing sector. We've made it clear that, under certain circumstances, the baseline decline expected of some manufacturing entities may be less than would otherwise have been under the proposal circulated in January, and we're working through the consequences of that in the way that you've requested.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:18</span>):  I think it's very germane at this point to just point out that the government's reserve—and we haven't heard otherwise—may be shifted a bit from 17 million tonnes, but it seems like as good a figure as any. Mr Bowen has confirmed that in the media. Even if there has been a shift, it is probably a few million tonnes here or there. That is 17 million tonnes of the 1,233 million tonnes that's the overall cap for the next seven years. That's our carbon budget we're stuck to for manufacturing, for mining and for transport in this country. We can't do more than that. This is a cap on economic growth. Let's be clear what the government has confirmed tonight: it's a cap on Australia's economic prosperity, it's a cap on our economic growth and it's a cap on our ability to make things and manufacture things in this country. We can't exceed this cap. They're going to put it in law. It's stuck.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Okay, to give the government their due, they have put a reserve in it. They have been very generous and put a reserve to account for some growth. Well, 17 million tonnes out of 1,233 million tonnes—guess what that works out to? 1.3 per cent. We can grow 1.3 per cent over the next seven years. How good is that! You think we'd like our economic growth to be somewhere around three or four. You'd like that to be the case. You'd hope and pray that we can offer the Australian people increasing real wages and living standards over time. Keep in mind that, if we don't grow as an economy, your real wages won't go up, your living standards won't go up, things will get more expensive and you won't get paid more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government is saying is that now the only thing you can expect is a 1.3 per cent increase in your living standards over seven years—seven years! This was a mob that came to power by saying they're going to make your life easier, they're going to cut power prices and they're going to increase real wages. And here tonight they're putting in a cap on your living standards, a cap on what you can afford. We've had that confirmed tonight by the minister, unless she can say otherwise. Unless she can tell us what the other figure is here, it is 17 million tonnes out of 1.2 billion, and that's 1.3 per cent over seven years. That's not 1.3 per cent a year, by the way; it's 1.3 per cent for seven years. So let's just work that out. It's 1.3 per cent over seven years, so the growth per year is a whole 0.18 per cent. Every year you can grow and your life can get better by 0.18 per cent. So, if you're earning 100 grand at the moment, you can thank your lucky stars and you will get a pay increase of—let me work this out. I don't use this calculator very often. I should be able to do this in my head, but I'm getting old! You'll get a pay increase of $18. You can look forward, under this hard cap, to an $18 a year pay increase! Don't spend it all at once! That's my advice. It's just $18. That's what they're doing to us. It's a hard cap on our economic growth, and that's what they've just admitted here in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go back, though. Minister, one of the answers you gave me was quite revealing. You mentioned that we've got a reserve, which you won't and can't tell us about. Mr Bowen could tell the ABC how much the reserve is, but he can't tell a parliament—but it's about 17 million tonnes. You also mentioned that you've got a growth factor in there for new entrants. You're already projecting some new entrants over the next seven years. My question is: how much is that? You've obviously done that work. You've admitted you've done the calculations. Under that 1,233 million tonne cap, how much, in your calculations, have you factored in for emissions from new entrants until 2030?</span>
