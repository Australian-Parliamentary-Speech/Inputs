                presented a petition from certain citizens of Canberra showing that the proposal to levy a sewerage charge in Canberra is unjust in that the people of Canberra already pay dearly for the services provided to them, in premiums on land, in land rental re-assessed every 20 years, and in payment of general rates.
            </para>
            <para>The petitioners therefore pray that the House will disallow Ordinance No. 30 of 1968 and refrain from imposing a sewerage charge unless and until it can be shown that such a charge is justifiable and that it will bear justly on all people, and that before any such charge is imposed it can be fully justified and supported by a complete and accurate detailed set of accounts and balance sheet relating to the finances of the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Customs and Excise. Was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr G.</inline> Hoffmann recently charged by the Department of Customs and Excise with allegedly falsifying customs records? Was he found guilty and dismissed from the Public Service? Did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann</inline> appeal against his dismissal and was such appeal disallowed? ls it a fact that within a few weeks he was reinstated in the Department, and if so on whose recommendation or advice was he so reinstated? Will the Minister table in the Senate a copy of the recommendation or advice so tendered? Did the Minister order his reinstatement, and if not, who did? Did his reinstatement have anything to do with pressure from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to cover up public exposure of espionage activities by officers of the said Security Service in the embassy in Canberra of a friendly nation? </para>

                        <para>- I shall answer the question. Part of the question was related to customs but nevertheless it is linked to the adjournment debate last night inasmuch as it relates to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. As I indicated last night. I will refer to the Attorney-General what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and I would suggest that that is where it must remain. The honourable senator may not have been here during the adjournment debate last night, but if he looks at Hansard he will see that all of the points are covered. </para>

I refer to the epidemic of Hong Kong flu which faces Australia with the prospect of deaths, much suffering and great economic loss through absenteeism. From what the Minister said yesterday it seems there may be limited availabil'ity of the vaccine. Will the Minister tell us how this situation has arisen? Will the Minister tell us what steps have been taken to arrange for supplies of vaccine from overseas, especially to replace those which were sent from Australia when other countries were facing the same problem? Will the Government give an assurance that there will be enough vaccine in the country for everyone who wants it? </para>

We could not. of course, at this moment know the number who would receive injections because having an injection or not is a matter for a person's own choice. I said following on from that, that if there should be a shortage at the time the vaccine would be made available where it was needed most urgently and I quoted the recommended order of priority. However, I feel quite certain, because of the very real concern the people feel about this and because of the advice given to the Minister by the committee which has been meeting on this question, that supplies will be adequate. If I have further information on this matter I shall make it available to the honourable senator. </para>

                        <para>- The honourable senator will recall that some 14 months ago the Commonwealth Government announced that it would provide $24m for the amalgamation of marginal dairy farms and that this money would be made available to those who wished to use it on very attractive conditions with regard to the term of the loan, the interest rate of the loan and the fact that an allowance would be made for writing off redundant improvements. The proposition was put to the States. Because of administrative difficulties and because the States could see themselves being involved in certain expenses, we have to negotiate with the States an arrangement whereby this scheme would not involve them in any additional expenditure. In the course of several months last year we felt that we had come to a conclusion that would be acceptable to all States. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Prime Minister, on 30th September 1968, wrote to the various Premiers. The main purport of his message was that 50% of the money made available would be in the form of a grant to the States so that they could administer the scheme. Also, it was to write off redundant improvements by way of grant to the farmers concerned. Since that time the Minister has received communications from two States only. These were Western Australia and Tasmania which raised additional queries. I read in the Press, however, a. statement by the Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin,</inline> in which he announced that certain State Ministers for Agriculture had met in Sydney on 26th January to discuss the proposals. He announced also that he would be bringing forward certain propositions to the Prime Minister with the hope of implementing the scheme as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Is the Government aware of the serious concern among wheat farmers over the future of the industry, particularly in view of the large surplus of unsold wheat from the last crop? Will the Minister report to Parliament at an early date on the wheat situation? Were the much acclaimed recent sales to Communist China made at sterling prices, which may mean further heavy losses to be recouped by the Reserve Bank if Britain devalues again this year, as is possible? Does the Australian Wheat Board still refuse to reveal the prices of these sales to Communist China, even to the Parliament, and, if so, why is the Parliament not permitted to have this information? </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the honourable senator that the Government is very well aware of the problems that are affecting the disposal of last year's wheat crop. At the same time I want to deprecate the spirit of gloom that seems to exist throughout a large section of the community over the fact that we had such a record crop. This should be rather a matter for congratulation as it represents wealth to Australia, even if we do have difficulty in disposing of the wheat. </para>

                        <para>- It is wealth for Australia and we are very glad indeed to have it. I know which is better for Australia, to have a large crop and be faced with the possibility of having difficulty in disposing of tt at an early date or having crop failures. Which is worse for Australia, I ask? There will be difficulties but the farmers themselves are taking up this matter and are holding meetings throughout Australia to try to evolve a scheme whereby there will not be any great surplus of wheat in the future. I remind the honourable senator that we are not in the lap of the gods. To a large extent we are in the lap of the weather which controls the amount of wheat that we get in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- If the honourable senator has finished I will continue. Turning to the other part of the question, which relates to wheat sales to China, it has never been the policy of the Australian Wheat Board to announce the prices that it receives for wheat. After all, competitors come into calculations in the matter of sales, as I think everyone would readily understand. That is the reason why the Wheat Board, not the Government, makes the sale, and that is why the prices that have been obtained have not been made public. The honourable senator asked whether the sales made to China have been in sterling currency. I do not think they have been. </para>

Is it a fact that the Minister's colleague has negotiated recently an agreement with the Japanese Government to ship goods to Australia on roll-on roll-off type ships rather than on the new container type ships? Can the Senate be supplied with a detailed report on this matter? In view of the difficulties that the South Australian economy has been experiencing of late and the need for the South Australian Government to have every incentive possible to attract industry to this country, will the Minister please undertake to ascertain whether South Australia will be included in the itinerary of the roll-on roll-off shipping coming to Australia? </para>

Has the Minister  received any representations from people who claim that they are entitled to the intensive care subsidy but have not been able to obtain it? If so, and if there are a number of such representations, can a review of the situation be undertaken? Can anything be done about nursing homes which, by raising their charges, have denied their patients the advantage of the subsidy? </para>

                        <para>- The points raised by the honourable senator interest me very much and I am sure they will also interest the Minister for Health. The honourable senator referred to the intensive care benefit. This is part of the work being carried out by the Department of Health to help people who are in need of assistance. I do not know what complaints have been received by the Minister but I will personally pass on to him the comments made by the honourable senator. The Minister for Health has made available some very interesting figures concerning this matter. At 21st February last the intensive care benefit had been granted to 12.700 nursing home patients. Of all applications made for the benefit, 76% have been approved. This is well over 30% of the total of nursing home patients in Australia. The Minister expects the figure to rise to 40% of nursing home patients. I believe the figures illustrate the extent to which the benefit is being paid. I am concerned by the comment made by the honourable senator about increasing costs. I know that such factors are under constant consideration by the Minister for Health, but I shall pass on the honourable senator's comments to him. </para>

A few moments ago in reply to a question the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry said that it had not been possible to get the dairy amalgamation scheme off the ground because of lack of agreement of the six States, only two of which had replied and those two had raised queries. Is it possible to arrive at some reasonable means of administering this scheme solely under Commonwealth jurisdiction? I ask this question because, as the Minister representing the Attorney-General must be aware, if this difficulty of securing the agreement of the six States continues the scheme will fall to the ground. </para>

But in the circumstances I refer him to the fact that his question concerns, in the main, the acquisition or purchase of land and resettlement for agricultural purposes, both of which functions are peculiarly within the State jurisdiction. At the present time no peculiar Commonwealth power which we could use for the purpose of implementing this scheme without the concurrence of the States occurs to me. </para>

                        <para>- The honourable senator has asked me to give in detail the circumstances in which operatives were recruited in the United Kingdom for the Mirage programme in our aircraft industry. I will set about getting the information in detail for him. Speaking at question time and without notice, I am confident that in no case in which an employee has been engaged on a contract basis has there been any breach of faith. As the honourable senator pointed out in his question, there may be some variations. For example, in certain circumstances people may have carried on, at their own discretion, after the conclusion of their contracts. In fairness to the question, in which I believe all honourable senators are interested, I will obtain a detailed reply for the honourable senator. </para>

                        <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration. By way of preface, I refer to Department of Immigration news release 14/69, which announced the creation of an advisory committee to assess the relationship between professional qualifications obtained overseas and those obtained in Australia. My question refers to the second page of the bulletin, which states that the committee will examine the effects on State legislation of proposed amendments to the Nationality and Citizenship Act. I ask: Does this mean in effect that this legislation is to be delayed pending an inquiry by this new body? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot give the honourable senator a direct answer to the question he has raised, but he might be interested in some points concerning the new committee on overseas professional qualifications and its basic objectives. One of them will be to provide reliable information to be made available to those authorities whose responsibility is to pass judgment on whether applicants for entry into the professions measure up to our standards. It is hoped that in due course we will be in a better position to advise those who have obtained qualifications outside Australia on their prospects here. In order to allay fears that might still exist in some quarters I repeat that in reaching this decision all the Ministers agreed that a cardinal principle involved in any examination and recommendations that the committee might make would be the maintenance of existing professional standards in this country. The committee is to be essentially an advisory one. It will not have any executive authority or power to interfere with the responsibilities of statutory or professional bodies now responsible for the recognition of overseas qualifications, but it will indeed work in close co-operation with them. I have noted the other points made by the honourable senator and I will endeavour to obtain information on them. </para>

Is the Minister aware that yesterday the President of the United Graziers Association of Victoria released a Press statement strongly criticising the Commonwealth Government for failing to clarify its responsibility in regard to the provision of garbage incinerators at outports throughout the Commonwealth, particularly in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia? Is it correct that the Commonwealth has agreed to pay half the cost of access roads and the full cost of incinerators and ancillary structures but not operating, maintenance and replacement costs? If quarantine is unquestionably a Commonwealth responsibility, who is to pay the operating, maintenance and replacement costs? </para>

I remind the honourable senator that that was the subject of a comment by the Attorney-General. I think it would be proper to say that a cogent viewpoint to the contrary is that we best maintain the civilian individual rights that it is the purpose of this body to establish by vigilantly watching the particular occasions on which they are to be infringed or restricted, rather than by relying upon a general statement of principles such as is suggested. I suggest that the American experience underlines that viewpoint. The Government has not, since this conference in Canberra, had the matter before it specifically, but I have made reference to the viewpoint of the Attorney-General and I have stated my own view at the present time in answer to the honourable senator's question. </para>

I have not the figures for those who are receiving benefits as a result of being casualties in other theatres. There are 1,280 members receiving pensions after having served in Vietnam. There are 1,473 dependants of incapacitated servicemen and 186 dependants of deceased servicemen, giving a total of 2,939. The honourable senator will probably be interested to learn also that to date over 10,000 national servicemen have returned to civilian life.

                        <para>- I have not seen the report to which the honourable senator refers, but I can assure him that the Commonwealth Government is very concerned at the number of accidents happening on roads throughout Australia. Probably this is one of the reasons why the Government has made such large sums of money available to the States for the improvement of our road systems. </para>

                        <para>- The honourable senator interjects that we kept $12m back. All I can say is that the amount of money we are making available at present is ten times as great as that which was available when we came into office and the roads of Australia are ten times better today than they were when we came into office. I ask that the honourable senator put his question on notice so that I may obtain for him a detailed reply to this specific point he raises. </para>

                        <para>—The honourable senator loves to dish it out but he dare not 
take it. I will be persistent and say this: I have always assumed during my long parliamentary life that every honourable member or senator in any parliament of 
the British Commonwealth, the Australian Commonwealth or any other democratic parliament accepted that when a Minister gave an answer he gave it in good faith. I am prepared to accept that Senator Kennelly, in the first part of his statement, may not have meant to say what he said. It was clearly an implication that Senator Scott had deliberately falsified, and deliberately deceived this Senate. I resented it.</para>

                        <para>—Yes.I am informed that the total payments to 31st January 1969 in respect of the F111C project have been $A151,356,282. As to the delivery date, as the Senate would be aware there was the question of the modified wing carry-through box which failed 
under continuous fatigue tests. Further investigations by the United States Air Force and experts from the General Dynamics Corporation have commenced. We have sent to Fort Worth civilian and Service experts from Australia and we are being kept informed of the progress of the investigations. It is altogether premature to attempt to reach conclusions at this stage. 
When it is possible to reach conclusions as to the nature of the modifications which may be required and their effect on the timetable and other matters the Senate will be informed.</para>

He wanted to know whether it was possible for an applicant to appear personally before the Committee. I told him that I did not think so but I would make inquiries. I have done so and I find that no provision is made for an applicant to appear in person. There 
was no such provision in civil cases during the 1939-45 war and the Korean war.</para>

                        <para>— I am not able to answer off thc cuff as to increases in the prices of lubricating oils. However, I can tell the honourable senator that because of recent negotiations between the Prime Minister and Esso-BHP it is not expected that the travelling public will have to pay large increases in the price of motor spirit. Until 17th September 1970 the price of crude oil produced by Esso-BHP will not exceed $2.47 a barrel, whereas under the 
previous agreement reached after negotiations the price would have been $3.17 or $3.19. The difference in those prices indicates that there will be a very small increase, if any, in the price paid for petrol by the Australian travelling public.</para>

                            <para>There is difficulty in deciding where the line should be drawn when considering what mineral discoveries should be classified as 'major'; and also between categories (b) and (c) of part 3 of the question on the area of contribution of the Bureau of Mineral Resources towards discoveries. In addition there are a number of ore bodies that are currently being developed, or are in production that cannot really be described as completely new discoveries. They are adjacent to or extensions of ore bodies discovered and worked many years ago. Other deposits were known for many years but were not, until recently, exploited because of their situation as regards export markets, transport, technology, etc. Also the question on allocating a date for a discovery is not easy. This is particularly so when, as in the Tennant Creek area, magnetic anomalies from a survey carried out one year may have to wait several years to be tested, and several more years of testing may be required to demonstrate that a mineable ore body does in fact exist. In Tasmania, substantial increases in ore reserves have been achieved at Mount Cleveland, Renison. Mount Lyell and Savage River as a result of drilling prospective areas which have been covered by Bureau of Mineral Resources geophysical surveys. These surveys played a substantial part in the selection of successful drilling targets. </para>

                    <para>A schedule of 'major' mineral discoveries is tabulated below and explanatory material added where necessary. The level of additional reserves resulting from these discoveries are shown where known. </para>
                    <para>Under the schedule detailing petroleum discoveries, only those gas discoveries whose tested rates are greater than 1 million cubic feet per day are listed. The Bureau of Mineral Resources' contribution to these discoveries is indicated, although, apart from physical and operational contributions, subsidy payments have also played a major role in the history of petroleum discoveries. Of the fiftyone discoveries listed, twenty-nine (57%) were assisted by the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act. The Bureau examined these subsidy applications and recommended them for Ministerial approval. The subsidised operations were subsequently overseen by the Bureau. </para>
                    <para>One of the Bureau's main contributions in mineral discoveries has been by way of the provision of basic and detailed information through geological, geophysical and other scientific and technical surveys on which the exploring companies drew heavily in planning and executing their exploration and development programmes. Most, if not all, companies have discussed their exploration programmes with Bureau officers, and consulted the Bureau's published and unpublished information on the areas in which they were interested. </para>

In the country, priority is given to areas of scattered population remote from dental facilities, and these children are treated in mobile dental units. Limited numbers of metropolitan children are treated at school dental centres. Country and metropolitan children's institutions are also visited. No child is treated unless parental consent has been previously given. </para>

Throughout the State, primary schools beyond a radius of 15 miles of a hospital dental clinic are visited by school dental cervices. </para>
                    <para>South Australia - The present policy of the South Australian school dental service provides a service for government primary school children (Grade 1-VII) in country areas where there are no resident dental practitioners. The range of treatment is generally confined to prophylaxis, fillings, extractions and minor orthodontic cases. The service also provides dental health education to children and mothers' clubs. The children at six Social Welfare Department institutions in' Adelaide are treated during the school vacations. An emergency service is offered to pre-school and secondary school children in regions visited. </para>

                        <para>Regarding parts 4 and 5 as far as minerals other than oil are concerned it is impossible to produce a meaningful answer. </para>
                        <para>Prospecting for minerals is carried out under a number of methods of holding ground which vary with the State or Territory concerned. In some cases, the tenements are known as authorities to prospect, in others as special mining leases, temporary reservations, exploration licences, etc. In still other cases, production tenements such as mineral claims are used to hold ground for prospecting. In Western Australia alone there are 800 temporary reserves, either in existence or applied for. </para>
                        <para>Some of these tenements are held by individuals, others by syndicates or companies. In the case of individuals there is no record to show whether the individual is acting on behalf of a company or not. In the case of companies the State Mines Departments do not obtain any indication of whether they are overseas owned or are agents for or subsidiaries of overseas companies. It is also not unusual for options over such tenements to be given by individuals or companies to other companies, and this cannot be determined from the records kept by the States. </para>
                        <para>Moreover, information obtained in this field very quickly becomes out of date; the problems of producing accurate data are aggravated by the large number of tenements involved and the short term for which they are usually run. </para>

                            <para>It is not correct to say that the Government ignored the celebration of Australia Day in Canberra in 1968. It has been customary for some years past for my colleague the Minister for External Affairs, to hold a reception at Parliament House on a convenient day during the week in which 26 January falls, to which are invited Heads of Diplomatic Missions, the Ministry and representative citizens of Canberra and nearby areas. Such a reception was held on 25 January 1968.</para>

                    <para>I understand that it is the practice in most of the Australian States for private groups, such as the Australia Day Council, to initiate and undertake celebrations, with some assistance as necessary from the State Government or local government authority. This seems to me to be a very desirable approach as it more closely identifies the local community with the celebrations.I would be happy to support, through my Department, such an approach in Canberra should a group of representative citizens be formed for that purpose. </para>

                    <para>When it was considering a scheme of charges payable by passengers for the use of Commonwealth airports, the Government had regard for the position of intrastate travellers in all States. As announced when the relevant legislation was introduced into the Parliament, the Government decided to exempt the great majority of country aerodromes from the scheme of charges, and in South Australia the only airports where charges were to be payable were Adelaide, Kingscote and Port Lincoln. </para>
                    <para>It was not the intention of the Government to impose a tax on air travel, but to obtain a modest amount of revenue from air passengers for the use of costly facilities operated and maintained at considerable expense by the Commonwealth. The Government was prepared to grant some concessions or exemptions in the charging arrangements, but to go further than this would have meant that the shortfall in revenue would have to be met by the general taxpayer or by increasing the charges payable by other passengers. </para>

Green, Xavier Herbert, Thomas Keneally, Alan Marshall and Judith Wright. The primary criterion in determining the award of fellowships is outstanding literary ability or the promise of high literary achievement of the applicant. Among major works of literature produced by authors who have held two or more fellowships are Green's 'History of Australian Literature', Ernestine Hill's 'My Love Must Wait', Alan Marshall's'I Can Jump Puddles', Lett's 'A Biography of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hubert</inline> Murray', Mackenzie's 'Dead Men Rising' and 'The Refuge'. </para>
